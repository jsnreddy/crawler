I have been using this company for years. My state tax has to be refiled. Apparently I am entitled to a deduction that their site didn't ask me about. I think they are using a generic state software which is incorrect because states vary. read more hide
When the consumer's income tax was filed via the agency, ExpressTaxRefund.com, to where the official IRS website led her in April 2009 for 2008 individual income tax return file, the IRS paid the filing fee, about $150, directly to the agency that not only did not disclose the itemized and total filing fees through the whole the filling process but also did not asked for my permission or authorization for the deduction when the file was submitted. It was also clearly stated by the IRS before leading the consumer to the agency's website that the eFile was free for the certain income level. The IRS was notified of the fee deduction from the refund by the agency charging $35 fee for the transaction that the agency had never been authorized as they had never sought. But the IRS responded to the message by simply stating that they were not affiliate with the agency and no further direction to resolve the issue was guided to the consumer. As time passes and things have happened after the file, a couple of questions happened: (1) Is this tax prep agency selling personal information related to individual incomes to the business running a scam for the poor or who may seem to be in desperate need for cash? (2) Can this tax prep agency keep on running the scam like business while specifically targeting the most poor and disadvantaged people due to any connection with IRS in New York State? Where can this consumer submit the specific and detailed documents supporting her claim to this business, ExpressTaxRefund.com? IRS office assigned to this tax filer's region? Attorney General's Office? Looking forward to hearing from Consumer Complaint Department. read more hide
I have utilized this tax filing service years prior and never had any difficulties. However, this year has been a nightmare. I received my federal refund but have not received my state refund. I have been attempting to call the 800 number listed for over a month now at many different times of the day to hear an automated recording stating they are closed and to call back during normal business hours. The State of Georgia also is not showing record of my return. This is very disturbing. Of course, I can't get through to anyone at the State of Georgia. I need help. read more hide
I was filing my 2009 tax return with ExpressTaxRefund.com but it did not calculate correctly as there are multiple errors. 1. I checked Married Separate, but when I clicked to preview the 1040 form at the end of the return, Married Separate was not checked for the Filing Status. 2. The number of exemptions was not listed on my 1040 tax return (preview copy). 3. Note that part of my social security earnings is taxable, but their return did not add this to my taxable wages. 4. The return did not allow me to turn in the sales tax that I paid for a new car purchased in 2009, which greatly affected my return. When I called these folks, they told me to file my return like it was, and then do an amended 1040X return later. These people do not know what they are doing. I completed my return with another free tax service and it did calculate correctly. read more hide
I filed, thinking it was free. The ad that I saw said it was. After that I realized that it was going to be well over $70.00. Now from what I understand it could even be more according to others. I did not intend to file through them, but seemed I was stuck before I even got a chance to go over the details. I tried to file my state, but there is no information at all about where and how to do that. I am very angry. This was so misleading and tricky. I tried to contact the company, but there is no information on contacting them. It has left me with a terrible feeling, thinking I had made a good choice. I have a lot of expenses to catch up on. One of us has been unemployed and we live paycheck to paycheck. One of our vehicles needs fixed. $1200.00 that we expected to get. read more hide
I filed my tax return and thought it was free. I have a disabled son that is a dependent and their program doesn't have the capabilities to check the box disabled. it doesn't exist. I could not view my tax return until they had already billed my credit card $79.95 and showed only 1 dependent instead of 2. It didn't count my son. I immediately called their number to explain that they didn't have the block "disabled" to check and my son wasn't added as a dependent. They informed me that their program didn't have that capability and I said I wanted a refund and they refused. These people are not even close to being legitimate and should be shut down! It cost me must more in taxes and I had to prepare my taxes with a different online company, which I have done for years and never had a problem. read more hide
I was not aware of the additional charges and called to find the charges which were not displayed on the screen. I asked to have the transaction deleted and they said that was not possible although I was calling minutes after the transaction was completed. I checked the next day to see if the IRS had received my return. They had not. I called again trying to get the transaction deleted. No help. My gross earnings for 2009 was 6651.00 and $2100.00 unemployment. I can't afford the charges which I after the fact found out $94.00.How can I get an answer as they have not yet notified me of my return being accepted by the IRS. I don't know if my return has been accepted and am afraid my calls will delay my refund read more hide
I contacted these people to file my federal and state tax forms. I didn't mind them charging $29.95, but they added charges. My bill was $104 to file my 1040EZ form. When I checked my bank account, I found out that they charged an additional $40 that they didn't tell me about. They never even filed my state tax form. I filed a complaint with the BBB in New York, but was told that this company returned a reply. Now, I've lost $350 with this company. read more hide
I have attempted several times to contact this company. My taxes were filed online and my account was charged for the service. I have the date of the charge and the information from the bank. I contacted the IRS and they assured me that they have nothing filed for me in 2008. I have been very patient and somewhat frustrated by the unprofessionalism of this company as I am reading through the complaints sent in by others. The irony of this is that I filed with them before and had no problem. read more hide
Terrible service all the way around. First of all, they told me they would email my completed tax forms for me to sign within 24 hours and it took three weeks. When I got them, they were incomplete, and had to have them redone which took another week. The IRS says their service is free and they charged me $80.00! Once I submitted the forms, I got a letter from the State Tax Board saying the tax return was completed wrong, and was missing an important form. According to the state, I will owe $100 more if this is not resolved. When contaxting expresstaxrefunddotcom, it took me almost 2 hours to get through to someone. After explaining the problem to "Chuck", he responded very rudely, saying that it was done right and it wasnt their fault if it was missing a page. According to the state, even with the missing page, expresstax should have claimed me as a first year resident, not partial resident. Chuck insists the state read it wrong and that THEY did the return right. He was extremely rude, refused to let me talk to his manager, and told me it would take atleast 2 weeks to re send me the completed tax forms. read more hide
I somehow got to this site via the IRS "free" e-file services. Complaint No. 1: This service is NOT free; in fact, it's one of the most expensive e-file services out there. Expect to pay at least $64 dollars. Complaint No. 2: They tell you they will file your state and federal taxes at the same time. This is NOT true. They file your federal and halfway fill out your state, but then (somewhere in the find print) they tell you to print it out and send it in. THAT IS NOT ELECTRONIC FILING. Complaint No. 3: The costumer service agents have attitudes you will not believe. Right off the bat, they're argumentative and rude. Go ahead and try calling but you'll mostly likely be hung up on or put on hold. read more hide
As an individual incometax filer whose adjusted gross income was below $56000 for the year 2008, I thought that I could take advantage of the free efile as IRS advised through the written booklet. Therefore,I went to the web site, IRS.gov/efile, and then was led to an incometax file web site. As a tax filer who has used the convenience of efile since 2003 by using the service provider either TurboTax or TaxCut, I filled out the blanks to file the income tax return and submitted as I used to do that. Through the whole process, no single authorization for the servcie fee deduction from the federal income tax refund was requested and no single disclose to charge any fee related to the service was disclosed even though the other service providers have done. The service provider did not provide the tax filer with any other option to transfer or to receive the refund, either. But no attention to the fee subject was paid by the filer because it supposed to be free based on the AGI bracket provided by IRS. But when the discrepancy between the refund and actual deposited amount was found, it was realized that the service fee $140.90 was automatically deducted from the federal refund. For the fees:Form 1040 $29.95; Schedule A $10.00; State Return: $20.00; Refund Transfer $35; Bank Fee for the Refund Transfer $$26.95 To whom/where the refund is being transferred? To the tax service provider by IRS, and then to the bank by the Service provider? Most banks provide their customers with the domestic fund transfer services at free. If it is too expensive for IRS to provide tax payers with the direct deposit service, let the tax payers have an option to pay for $61.95 fee for the convenienc of the direct deposit or to wait for the refund by mail with no fee by clearly disclosing the fee and options. Is IRS misleading lower income tax filers to efile for the business? read more hide
I filed my state and federal taxes together on Feb 19, a service for which i paid $44.00 upfront (the state return was $24 with a $20 e-file fee). i was advised on the website after filing that i would be emailed an update in 10-14 days, which was never received. i did my own research and discovered a problem, which was resolved between myself and the IRS. my state taxes were supposed to have been filed once the amount of federal taxes had been determined, which i trusted had been done. Tonight, 04/30/09, i discovered my state taxes had not been filed AT ALL. read more hide
I recently filed my tax return with express tax. I was not told about the fees. Only was charged $158.00. When asked why so much? I was told because i had 3 w-2's. When i saw my receipt it said that the original fee to file was $183.00 but i got a discount because i was refered by a friend. And i was promised that my return would be here in 2 weeks! It has not arrived. I filed on 4-10-09. Everyone else that has filed their taxes only paid $67.00 and that's with a rapid refund! I will never ever go to anyone else but H&R Block. I was not able to pay some bills due to such an expensive bill to file my taxes. read more hide
Called to check on status of my tax return...again. This is the 3rd or 4th time that I have had to re-submit the SAME info. I re-checked info needed with IRS. so this time I did NOT want to efile, instead have them give me a paper copy but the female re-submitted electronically anyway and said to check back in 2-4 days. I just want a paper copy. When I voiced my frustration, she told me to stop talking then put me in "time out" or on hold, came back on the line, asked me if I was ready to listent to her tell me the same information again and when I tried to get a paper copy she put me on hold again. Called back 3 times, each time the same thing! Asked for manager, she put me on indefinite hold. Still do not have my 2008 tax return filed. read more hide
I am unemployed, so I noticed you could get your Federal Taxes done free with Express Tax Refund. I used to use Turbo Tax, and never had a problem. Express Tax Refund told me that by a certain date, it would be deposited in my bank. Well, guess what? It was not there. I called them, and they told me that the IRS put a hold on my return, but they didn't know why. I talked to the IRS, and they said, "It was Express Tax Refund that didn't file for tax credit earned from 2007." Therefore, I would not receive my refund on time, and that the total was wrong. Turbo Tax never did that, but if they did, they would refund your money to the penny. I finally got my return two weeks later, whew! I needed a loan, so I went to my bank, and they told me I needed a copy of my tax return from 2007. Express Tax Refund, being the company that filed my taxes in 2007, had all the information I needed. I requested the information from Express Tax Refund 4 weeks ago. After one week, I contacted them. The lady I spoke to was really upset. She told me to go to a website just for my 2007 tax return. So, with her help, I tried everything she told me to do to get in the site, but nothing worked. She told me she would send them in the mail. After a week went by, I called back because there was no sign of my return. Somehow they had an old address of mine from 3 years ago. That was where Express Tax Refund sent my 2007 tax return. The lady was very upset with all that was going wrong with my return, so she sent it to the old address on purpose. I asked them to send it to the right address, and they assured me that they would do it that day. I waited another week. Nothing showed up in my mailbox. I called again, and they assured me that it would be there in another week. Tomorrow will be another week, and then I can apply for the loan. Turbo Tax would have never done that. After all that, I was then told that I had to pay for Federal taxes filed for 2008, when I was told it was free. I live in Alaska where there are no state taxes, so why am I being charged any fees? Turbo Tax never did that! I talked with a representative of Express Tax Refund, and demanded my money back. She became very angry, raised her voice, and told me that I would never get anything back. Turbo Tax would have given me the right return and my fee back if I complained. I shall proceed with a complaint about the tactics used to obtain money from the public to the Better Business Bureau. Turbo Tax would not do that! read more hide
This site is mixed in with the free federal tax filing services. They never say they are charging $29.95 for the service which is free everywhere else. They never give you the option of saying no to the charge. The make it seem like you are paying your tax. This service is a rip-off and should be fined. read more hide
I filed federal taxes online with Express Tax Refund on 4/14/09. There was no available way to print the documents, plus no mention of the fees incurred to file. After calling many times to find out a way to get a copy of the documents, I was told that the cost of filing was $104.95 plus I could not get a copy of my documents until they get their money (which would be taken out of the refund). The online information, after checking this morning (4/18/09), said I could get a copy of my tax return on May 1, 2009. This is ridiculous. read more hide
I was referred to this agency by the IRS of all things. The $29.95 service fee is not inclusive. The pricing on the website clearly indicates that there is also a filing fee of $20, a refund transfer fee (and what the hell is this?) of $35, and then a bank transfer fee (again, what the hell is this?) of $30.95. That bring the total cost up to $115.90. Why anyone would use four times as much to have a back water company do what Turbo Tax does is beyond me. Why the IRS advertised this service on their site as an honest service is either inept or corrupt. After using this service and having the charges delivered to me after the fact, the company never once answered its phones. It never sent a copy of the tax documents and never bothered to respond to a complaint from the Better Business Bureau. But there are people here claiming this service only charged them $4.95? They may want to double check the numbers. read more hide
I have been using Express Tax Refund for the past three years and I do not understand what these people are talking about. I get a $25 discount. I see my fees before I submit. The website is very user friendly. At first I did not know what I was doing as I was not very computer literate so I called their customer service on a sunday no less and they were opened surprise. Their customer service reps were very helpful they walked me through the process and now i am an expert. This year the big thing was that I needed to put my AGI i am not a tax expert so i called customer service and they helped me. So people read and follow instructions maybe you will have a pleasant experience as i did. read more hide
This website is very convenient and it took me only about 15 minutes to complete the application. The fees are low, especially since I received $25 dollars off for filing last year.

I personally have not had a single problem filing with ExpressTaxRefund for the past two years. read more hide
I went on the IRS FREE FILE which connected me to Express Tax Refund. I knew I would owe IRS so when it came to billing info I thought it was to pay IRS. When I checked my bank account the next day it showed that Express Tax charged me $49.95 and when they called me the same day because my return was rejected by IRS because my AGI was not included. I told them that the question was not on their form or I would have included that info. I also asked them why they charged me. I still don't know if my return was okey. read more hide
I efiled with this on line tax company. They advertised they were free for my federal, free e-filing and didn't even list how much any cost would be for any of their services. They also said they would email me of the statis and never did. Fast should never be used to discribe this company. And the finial charges were way higher than filing in person at any Taz company. I feel they deceived me. I had to call them three times to find out what was happening to the filing, the state taxes would not print out, and they cahrged me one sixth of my refund from the internal revenus service. read more hide

Thought I would do my taxes myself, logged onto taxact and Express Tax Refund came up, this is new territory for me but again I thought it was the same one used last year.I was assured it would be real easy to do just follow the instructions. It all went smoothly till the end. I tried to print a copy of my return there was nothing there. I called the customer help line and was told I would get one after they received my payment of $144.95 (which will be deducted from my refund). I should receive my money by 3/13/09. I asked for them to reject my return because I did not like how they handle their business but they said it could not be done.(1) I thought it was rapid refund NOT SO (2)VERY misleading, why would I want to pay all that money when you can do it FREE. (3) AND NOT TO BE ABLE TO PRINT OUT A COPY IMMEDIATELY IS SO WRONG (4) Now I am afraid I will not get my money because they were not up front with ALL the rules and regulations (5) I still have to wait for THEM to send my papers for the state so I can file them.

Express Tax Refund is a Misleading Company. It is neither Express nor Free! I got on the internet to find a website to do my Federal and State tax refund. While looking at the IRS.gov site I saw an advertisement for Free Federal filing of taxes. All my friends told me e:filing was the way to go. So I get on the web site and everything looks official. I put in all of my personal information from W-2' of both my spouse and myself, which is a scary thing to do...now someone has all of my personal info including SSN, Driver's license, D.O.B. Aagain, looks official, so I do it. After spending all the time to plug in the information, then you are informed that there will be a $130.00 charge taken out of your return. After spedning that much time with the web-site, I agree. They make promises to send e:mails on the status of your account. One week later I am still trying to find out if my taxes have been filed...I can not...my credit card has been charge $90.00 so far and I have a phone mess from God knows who on my phone saying my tax application has been rejected by IRS. And that I will have to file paper returns. To get my paper returns from them will be another $90.00. This is insanity. This company is WRONG and should be put out of service on the internet. Express Tax Refund is nothing more than con artists praying on people who can not afford to have half of their refunds taken away. Advertising for free tax preparation should be illegal. The site makes you go through the entire process before letting you know there will be a charge. By that time you are so frustrated that you continue and then the charges keep on coming. One last thing. They advertise and charge $20.00 extra for State Taxes and yet mine were never filed. Well for that matter neither was my Federal. I would not have been trying to find something free if I could affored to pay this amount to get my taxes done. And I still don't have the taxes done, now I have to go back to the beginning. read more hide

I went to irs.gov site to file income taxes. Last year I used Turbo tax with no problem. On the web page is also a listing for Express taxrefund.com, It said that filing was free just like Turbotax but they would also file your state form for free. So I used this site. When I finished I could not print the returns for 6 days, which I thought was strange, but it was free so I went along. When I checked back in a week later I was shown my federal refund would be $252. andshown an invoice for $104.95 which would be deducted from that amount. That was the first time I was ever informed that this was not free. When the direct deposit was made it was short $36.95. I called them they said that was an extra fee from the bank in California that did the direct deposit. I now have been charged $141.90 out of a $252.00 refund. And when I downloaded the forms I have to mail in the copy of my state tax becauce they never filed it, just printed a copy. Their site is still up and advertising free taxes prepared. Is'ntthis illegal? The damage was this ripoff company ended up with more of my tax refund than I did while saying it was free. read more hide

I was directed to the ExpressTaxRefund.com website from a free tax website. Initially there was no mention of fees; upon checking my email account for the confirmation email that the refund was accepted and processed I was informed in the corrospondence that I was billed $95.00 that they are taking out of my refund which I did not authorize. Upon contacting the company I was informed that it has already been processed and nothing could be done about it now. Noting that my refund was only $470 their fee was one third of my refund. I feel this is at least robbery by ommission since I was not informed at the time of submittal and at most fraud. As I am currently unemployeed and am a nearly full time volunteer at a local mission and am currently homeless my refund was desperately needed. I am delayed and maybe even derailed from the assistance that would have been available to me to re-establish myself productiveloy back into society. It is fraudlant companies that keep robbing americans and they are held blameless while we struggle to help others. read more hide

They have on their website a date that says if you file your taxes today you can receive your refund by a certain date. I filed my taxes on January 26, 2009 and the website that day said that I could expect to received my tax refund via direct deposit by February 6, 2009. Well today is February 6, 2009 and I didn't get my money. They insist that they have no control over when I receive my refund because the IRS releases the funds. I went out to the IRS site and it says I should receive my funds by February 17, 2009 providing I not owe anything or have any issues. I argued with the company by saying how can you promise someone they will their tax refund within a week when everyone knows that the IRS doesn't process anyone's taxes no earlier than 10 to 14 days. The site was misleading and on top of everything else I was not able to print my tax statement. The rep told that was because the IRS hadn't released the funds yet. I said no where on your site does it say that. What it does say is that I will be able to print a copy of my return on February 6, 2009. I would have never agreed to pay that company $125.00 to process my taxes when there are a boat load of FREE online tax services and they do depend on the IRS to release the funds via direct deposit. I have twin 3 yr olds, one being a special needs child. I was depending on that money to get my child's medication and he is due to have an MRI done next week. Which I am going to have to cancel. On top of that, I will be homeless, because I was depending on that money to move with. I want my $125.00 back from that company. They didn't keep their end of the bargain. Plus if there was going to a different date then what they promised me on the website, then why didn't I get an e-mail or some type of update? I told the company they have lousy customer services and I would be reporting them to OH's Atty General Office, the Better Business Bureau, or whoever will listen. read more hide
This company is no good. They lie about what it's going to cost,saying it'd be 2995 and ended up costing nearly 200.00. I could have done it myself for free, and it would have been faster.

Filed taxes and was told I would receive my refund by the 30th and be able to print my taxes.Didn't get my refund nor am I ableto print out my taxes. I called to find out the reason and was connected with someone who did not seem to know too much about anything. I explained my situation and she took my name and social security # and then stated that the IRS was experiencing delays that it would be another two weeks. So here I was charged for not only electronic filing (which should be free according to the IRS) but also a Refund Transfer fee which I don't know what exactly for since the IRS is claiming to be able to get my check to me faster what I was told on the phone today. That in total is $55.00 for nothing. They are not putting any money into their Customer Service Dept. How easy is it to say that it is the IRS is experiencing delays. It should be interesting when I will get my refund.

i went on the internet to file my taxes..i clicked on an irs link as i was seeking to do, and also one which was posted as being free...later to realize that it wasnt an irs site at all and had no way out...nor was it by no means FREE! the only instruction mentioned upon completion of filing return was to log on in a couple days to check the status of return, being sure irs accepted it and further info wasnt needed... i didnt really think it strange that no payment was mentioned whatsoever beings that my return is quite simple and those would be the ones accepted for free prep. sooo, just as instructed, couple days later that i accessed the site for status, stating my return was accepted by irs, and gave me a direct deposit date. i just about closed the page when i decided to scroll down the page further just in case any more info was below this searched info.it was then that i saw a whole list of charges for filing my return summing up to over a hundred $$$ dollars!!!!! i could not believe this!! i have never in my life paid that kind of money to file my taxes, especially not a simple 1040, there were charges i didnt ask for, nothing was ever mentioned! they just kept tacking charges on as i filed ..there are unauthorized charges for the prep...for each necessary form i had to file in order for this tobe complete, other charges and then an additional charge to efile it. not one single number/$amount was EVER mentioned NOT ONCE throughout this entire process!! what gives them the right---???---this is ROBBERY THEFT DECEPTION!pretending to be an irs site, then stealing your income tax money before you have a chance to help yourself or your family! im hoping that this message helps you and everyone out there to know whats happening and how many are believed to be going straight to the irs trusted site and find out other wise, days later---and its toooo late!! this is unacceptable and should be put to end!! there is no email address contact and every time i call the number its either busy or i get the answering machine which takes no messages and tells me the office is closed and to call back when business is open (leaving no hours to do so though!!!!) I AM NOW TERRIFIED THAT I WONT EVEN SEE THIS RETURN AT ALL AND THAT THEY WILL RAID MY ACCOUNT OF THIS AND EVERYTHING SINCE THEY HAVE MY BANK INFO FOR THE DIRECT DEPOSIT! PLEASE HELP ME! i am a single mom of 2 and please know how badly and desperately we await this return!! read more hide
I paid Tax Express to prepare my 2006 Tax return for which I have a receipt: federal and state. I am now being notified by the Missouri Department of Revenue that I didn't pay my 2006 state taxes. I've tried to contact Mary ** by email but didn't receive a response. I've tried the 800 number listed on their web-site, and it is disconnected. read more hide
My family and I are going to lose our house if we don't get it refinanced. Well, we needed all kinds of paperwork including our tax refunds from the past two years. We paid the fees and submitted all of our information but were told that we would have to wait 24-48 hours for the report. Well, we needed now, so we called their number.... And we've been on hold for the past hour and a half. For a company who boasts that they're here 7 days a week to ensure that your experience with ExpressTaxRefund.com is as Quick and Simple as possible, they sure do make it impossible to contact them. Quote from Expresstaxrefund.com. This is outrageous. There is no reason that the phones are left unanswered. Overall, this is the absolute WORST company ever. read more hide
I filed for my economic stimulus payment, was charged $49.95, and never received my payment. Their website says my submission was accepted and that I was paid by direct deposit on April 25, 2008. Now what? I am trying to live on Social Security and need my money. read more hide
This company rides the rails of deception to make their money. At first I though it was an IRS site. Their charge amounts were not stated upfront. After realizing that I was not able to see my return or anything about the state return and I would have to wait - I felt ripped. read more hide
I thought I was dealing with the real IRS. I filled in some information, but not all. I tried to delete it but could not. This firm has my social security number. I believe I am now a victim of identity theft. read more hide
I thought I was connected to the IRS site and much to my amazement found that I had been charged $69.95. It could have been an overdraft for me because I am retired and live on a fixed income. Instead, it meant I will not be getting new glasses for 2 more months. I know it probably wasn't as catastrophic for me as it was for some people but why is this allowed? To me, their advertisement was fraud. read more hide
On March 2, 2008 I checked for a charge to this site and in 5 sports it says FREE, and guess what it is not, they charged me $114.95 and when I sent a letter stating the fact they were charging me and that the site says free, the next week I checked and found out that they charged me $154.95. I also would like a refund and to have the BBB look into to this also. I will call the BBB and tell them. read more hide
I stumbled on expresstaxrefund.com thinking that I was entering the IRS site which I have used in the past. I clicked to file my form before I filled out any info, other than bank, credit card, etc. I called the company and was told that it was too late to do anything about this. Then, I called and talked with a woman who told me that (obviously) the IRS would reject my file. I called the company again, and if I use them to file again I will have to pay another fee. This is ridiculous. Can't the IRS do something about these people? After reading the website with all the complaints, it seems that the IRS should do something about them. If nothing else, warn people about them. Right now I am out $49.00 and still have to file my taxes---with another company. read more hide

Express tax refund told me that I would be able to print my tax return on the computer my tax return was supposed to be 6,341.00 on February 8, 2008. Then I called to Express tax refund hotline they said I should recieve it February 12, 2008. I recieved no check. So I called the Irs and asked them when was my check going to be mailed out they said February 15,2008. So I asked how much was it the lady said $472.00. So I called Express tax refund they got smart with me I asked them where is the a total where is my money. They said that refund on the computer said they would been sending me was 3,356. All I recieved was 472.00. This company is a total rip off. Now me and my kids will be put in the cold because of my lease expires February 29,2008. I was depending on that return so I could move some where else. I don't have a job just had a newborn. read more hide
I used express Tax Refund to file my 2007 tax return. They do not tell you what fees that are charging until you finish filling in all of your information. I ended up paying $140.00 to file my state and federal refunds. They fail to inform you that you have to print and mail your state return and do not let you review it until you have already received your federal return. I have always done my taxes through H&R Block in the past and have never had any problems like I had this year filing with Express Tax Refund! I warn anyone who reads this do not use this company! If you do decide to use them please read through everything before completing your refund because they fail to tell you important info. until after you have already filled your return! If I had filled my taxes with H&R block like I had in the past they would have e-filed my state tax return for me and I would not have had to wait 6-8 weeks to receive it. I now have to postpone my son's surgery for another 6-8 weeks until I get my state return in the mail! read more hide
I thought I was on the IRS Free E-file site. I went to Google and put in the above info and several things came up one of which said free e-file for taxpayers under $54,000.00. I clicked on it and proceeded to put in the info. I was never asked for any info on paying. I truly thought that I had sent the return directly to IRS. Later on I was looking at the sheet I printed out and realized that it wasn't the IRS at all. I immediately (within a 24 hour period) called and requested to cancel the entire transaction. I always thought that every organization had to adhere to the three day cancellation option. I was told that the return had been e-filed already. I inquired about the fee I would be paying and the answer was $159.10. This was my daughter's return, and she cannot possibly afford that outrageous fee. I could have mailed the return for her and she would have paid nothing. I had the return all made out and saw the ad on the IRS 1040 EZ packet and assumed it would go smoothly, and I must admit it went so smoothly I was amazed and happy that I had gotten it in for her for free. I am sick about this and I have learned a valuable lesson and will not make the same mistake again. I hope that filing this helps someone else. read more hide
my taxes were filed efilings by expresstaxrefund their prices are not shown correctly on their web-site it says they charge 29.25 for efilings then in small itty bitty print there are added charges some shown others not shown anyhow my charge of only 29.95 grew to be 140.90 and they there is no customer complaint # to call and ask why these charges are so high, only a # telling you when your refund is being deposited charged to much money for doing a simple tax refund for only a ex1040 their fees are not being shown they make you think you are getting filings for 29.95 and it ends up being 140.00 read more hide
I used the website on the inside cover of the IRS booklet i received and it said that efile was free. I then proceeded to fill out the form. Somehow this changed to the Express tax refund website. There was no mention that this had switched over so i finished filing. When i finished I realized this was not the IRS. My futher research indicated it was Express tax. I then saw the fees after filing for over $100 to file an easy 1040EZ. i immediately tried to call the number listed but was told office closed. The next day I finally talked with a Nicole. I explained that i has filed in error and could she please cancel as why would i pay $104 to file an EZ. She told me to call Irs. I asked for a supervisor and she told me no one was in. I pleaded and she said call back in a few days (which she knew it would be filed by then). I called back and asked for supervisor and she told me she was the supervisor. As your other complaints, that was my whole savings and survival money. After they stole the initial $104 as Nicole told me th e fee would be,when i get my refund deposited, it is even less.I am missing another $37. I am now afraid they will use that vital information to continue to steel my social security number and bank information. read more hide
There was a link online that said Fast ,easy, and accurate tax refund. Free live help. It said it was sponsored by the IRS. There is no warning of a charge whatsoever until you have already submitted your refund and information. The office has a customer service but does not have a direct phone line. In order to get a refund you must write a letter explaining what happened. read more hide
I filed my taxes with a direct deposit and when the date came I received no money. I then looked at my taxes and some how my checking account number and routing number were changed...so I called them and they told me that a check had been sent out and to expect it in 3-4 days. I waited 5-6 days and no check. I then called back and they said well wait a couple more days because it might take longer. And once again I waited. I called back after not receiving a check and talked to a manager. My refund has been reduced by $50. read more hide
I filed state taxes and have never received a check. I went to log into my account to find that I have no account with Express Tax Refund. If that is not enough, I had just filed my taxes with them and now I have no access to the record of me ever doing it at all. Where is my state taxes, where is my refund information, what happened to log in and password info? I sent a “forgot password” e-mail and for the past 6 days I have received nothing concerning my password. But, the marketing newsletter comes sometimes twice a day. Express Tax Refund took my tax information and seemingly disappeared. read more hide

What haooened to a secure login, I am very displeased. I will let you know if I recieve any tax return from this company. Note I am due $398.00 after their fee, so lets see what happens this year. read more hide
In early January i filed my tax with this company. I was told to check back for a status as to when expect my return so therefore i did. It said on the website that i should have it in my account on the 26th of January. I went to the website to download and print off my return and was looking at the account number and the routing numbers finding they had been changed. Then went to the bank website to see if the money was in my account in the amount of 3812.00 i found nothing. I have tried to call this company and the 3 time i called there was a busy signal and the next time i got a recording to call back during normal business hours mind you this was at 10:30 PST. Then checked my email had a message there stating the was an RT has been mailed to you on the 25 of January. Now what is RT and why would it have to be mailed? When you requested a direct deposit. I have counted on this money to catch up my rent and get my car payments caught up as i have been unemployed. And put some food on the table for me and my kids as i am a single mom and this has caused a real burden. read more hide
The Irs tax form lists this company as a provider of online tax preparation. The implication is that the IRS has approved this company's tax services. This is a total rip off in that as you file your return, the costs are Not disclosed until after the return is filed. This is a total rip off. 20 percent of my refund was charged. read more hide
