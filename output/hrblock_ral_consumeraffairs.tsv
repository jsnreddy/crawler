If I could give less than one star I would. I HATE this card and have finally deactivated it. Not only do they claim NOT to charge an annual fee... they do btw, they also charge you to pay off your card! I used my tax refund as is what you are supposed to use and then another 35$ was charged to me! On top of all of this their customer service is AWFUL. No one speaks hardly any understandable English, and I have had two people literally hang up on me when I asked questions. It's sketchy. They cannot answer one simple question without asking you SSN instead of the card number. The online, and phone, vs. when you call them; your balance is different on each option!!! Not to mention when you call them about this they have absolutely no idea and hang up on you. This has been the worst decision ever to have this card and I cannot wait to go home and slice it into pieces. read more hide
I am highly pissed. I recently did my taxes with HR Block and I was due to get back 2,878 in refund from my taxes. So I received my taxes last Tuesday and I only received 2141.20. So I was between 600 and 700 dollars short. So I contacted HR Block to ask them, "Where is the rest of my money?" And they claimed that they took out 600 to pay back a emerald advanced that I took out in November which I didn't. I only received an HR block to use to put my paycheck on and I just activated the card two days ago and it only has 45 cents on it and the only thing I paid for them to do was my taxes and that was 24.99 and the refund deposit fee was 34.95 altogether. That was 61.29 and I want to know where's the rest of my funds. read more hide
Went in to Apply for emerald advance assuming it was based upon my income tax refund and was denied due to too many credit inquiries in past 6 months. What the heck? I was happy when they advertised it on the Tv. I thought it was an answer to my prayers. My family has been struggling for the past 4 months and finances are getting tight and I thought this would help. I have received this in the past and have been a satisfied customer for many years. Whatever happened to the RAL's that they use to do in the past? I trust their service. Their advertisement makes it seem like you are guaranteed a loan and it is not so. I only want 500 to pay an electric bill. They can have it back when the taxes come in. read more hide
My husband and I received a holiday tax advance on Nov 24, 2015 which was loaded on an Emerald Card that very same day. With in 24 hours the money was stolen off the card and used in Ohio. This was a new card given to us that day at the H&R Block office in Branson, Mo. This is our 2nd time with this issue and they refuse to say there is a problem in their systems. The first time, we received a phone call and got our funds back in a short amount of time, this time I have had 2 operators from the Emerald Card hang up on me and refuse to release any information about when we will get our money back at all. My advice to all who receive an Emerald Card in office to remove all fund at time of receiving it and do not load personal funds on them, they have a glitch in the system and easily hacked! read more hide
Figured I would go with a well-known company and knew I was filing my well underemployed taxes with them. First few months were OK, added direct deposit, but if ya link another acct it takes 5 biz days even after it goes through, just too long. My main complaint is it's now been canceled twice in 2 weeks for fraud protection. I've called to let them know they have me on the phone and I'll answer me anything to lift the block. Both times they say up to 48 hours till manager will call and they can't tell me why. Meanwhile every direct deposit, transfer and PayPal goes directly into this card. I can't get gas, go to work, eat, anything and these jerkoffs can't explain why. One time I can let it go but 2 weeks later and the order I made that may have set it off cause it was online and I hit pay twice because the tablet is so sensitive is canceled and I can't even see my balance or info. It's like I was wiped off the grid. You suck Block and hire some Americans at least during daytime hrs, geez. read more hide
Me and my husband went and filed our taxes with H&R Block at the Federal Way location by KFC. We also asked them to do a second look on our past taxes. We gave them all our past tax information to have a second look done. Well the lady that helped us didn't give us any indication that she was going to be going on vacation and that the second look wasn't going to be done for awhile. We filed on 3/29/2015 and I emailed the lady at H&R Block on 5/7/2015 to see if we could get our records back. I received a response from the manager and she stated that she would get back to me and let me know when I could pick up our records. I never received an email letting me know when I could retrieved our records. I called on 5/21/15 and she basically stated that they have misplaced our records and that she has to try and locate them. I will never go to H&R Block again. read more hide
I have used H&R Block in the past with no problems but this year it has been awful! I still haven't gotten my refund and I filed 2/9/15. I have called and stopped by but they can't tell me anything but "The IRS is slow this year." But no, can't get anyone on the phone or in the office to find anything out! I will never use this company again. read more hide
I spent 2 hours on the phone explaining my issues, to be put on hold and directed to 8 different customer services, to be told that they couldn't give my refund on my Emerald card. I wouldn't have paid 32$ for the card to have just 52$ of my refund put on the Emerald card. When my refund was 1017$ and the 945$ was put on the eGift card when I didn't want the eGift card. Like I said before, 7 years going through H&R Block and I can't even use my refund the way I want to when I worked for my taxes. I should be able to get them of how I want them. It's my money, they should be able to give my refund the way I want to. I'll never go through H&R Block ever again. Be a pitiful thing if it happened to you and all the answers you got is "yeah we can't help you there". Poor business towards valid customers. read more hide
Very disappointed!!! I would like to first of all say, my tax specialist was very nice. I did receive my refund promptly. It was a check from H&R Block, not the Federal Government. I also knew the fee for my tax preparation would be coming out of my refund check. I was not aware, however that H&R Block would be taking out an additional 35.00. Upon receiving my check, there was a 4 digit code at the top of the check. I called the 800 number and got that authorization code. Apparently, the bank was suppose to get the authorization code, not me. This resulted in me having to go to H&R Block to have them void out the original check, request a direct deposit. I was told initially this would take 3-5 business days. Not so! ** who originally faxed in the voided check, and told me it would be direct deposited within these 3-5 business days recanted. She spoke to the main office in Kansas City, and was told they need the physical check before they could do a direct deposit into my account. With all of that being said, it took 3 phone calls to **, 3-31-2015. She initially said she would call the Kansas City office when they opened up. No response by mid-afternoon, so I called again, she was in a meeting, and would return my call. By 4:30, I called a third time, and was connected to her. That is when she gave me all of the information. A returned phone call would have been nice. read more hide

I went to get to H& R Block to get my taxes done. All my paperwork was in order. It took 45 minutes to an hour and they charged me $349.35 for the filing fee, Federal Refund Anticipation Check of $34.95, Federal RAC Check Fee $25.00 for a total of $409.20. This is ridiculous, the anticipation check fee should not be charged since they wait for the IRS to approve the refund, there is no anticipation. Also, I went on the IRS website my refund was done on February 19th, it is March 9th and I still do not have my check. They are a total rip off. The lady told me that we were paying for the commercial and their paycheck. When they told me the fee at the end, I told them to cancel it and I would do myself. She said that it had been sent through. read more hide
I had my taxes done with H&R BLOCK for the 7th year in a row. I have never had a problem until now. I was "accidentally" sent a RAC check, issued in my previously married name. I was expecting a Emerald Card to be issued in my name and mailed to me, because I wasn't asking for an immediate $1000.00 loan. The tax advisor told me it was a $35.00 fee for a Emerald Card. I electronically signed my refund away. This was 8 weeks ago. I was issued the check, and no bank would cash it because I no longer hold ID's in my name. I went back to H&R BLOCK...my tax rep had no idea what to do, and he reached out to someone else in H&R BLOCK via an Messaging System. They told me to mail back the physical check, with a check replacement form, and a letter of instruction telling them to load the funds on to the card. The tax rep then issued me a card, but failed to put my info on it. When I mailed everything out, I included a copy of the messaging conversation. I mailed it priority mail, guaranteed with a tracking number. It was delivered successfully. Three weeks later, I have had to have 2 more cards reissued, because this rep had no idea how to issue them. I had to go to another office 45 minutes away. I STILL do not have the funds on the card, despite my calling daily. NOW they are telling me they never received the check/letter/form that was delivered 2 weeks ago. I BEGGED for them to just stop payment on the check (THEY ARE A BANK) and transfer the funds to the card -- WHATEVER THE FEE MAY BE. I cannot get a supervisor to call back. I had a representative hang up on me after waiting 45 minutes on hold. I have cried, begged, bargained with these people. There is NO customer-centricity, no follow through. I will never come back to H&R BLOCK again. I am STILL waiting for over $8000.00 to be returned to me. OF MY MONEY. Who do I call? What do I do?? read more hide
I went to H&R for help with an audit letter (6000.00), this lady "Stella **" said she would help me and had me fill out a power of attorney and said she would deal with them for me. After one week I called and she said she was working on it. Two weeks later I got a letter and called Stella and she said don't accept those letters, they're only supposed to go to her. Ok, I called 3 months later and she said she was still working on it. So I went in there to do this year's taxes and I asked Stella about the audit (because I got a letter telling me I owe 7036.00). Now, she said "Yeah, I have to find it in storage." I then asked, "I thought this was an on going case." She then said "Yeah... I will call you when I find it." I called her 3 times and she said "I'm busy." This lady cost me 1300.00 in interest. So I called support and they sent me somewhere else and I also told support that Stella has all my personal paperwork from 3 years and they should hold her accountable for this. After all this they won't call me or hold Stella accountable nor give me back my paperwork. You guys cost me 1300.00 in fines and won't even do this year's taxes, and now my wages are garnished.... ** H&R I guess it's time for small claims and BBB reports. This is outright Fraud. read more hide

I went to H&R Block to file my taxes. Taxes. The lady lied to me and said the e-file was no longer open through the IRS and we would have to file it on paper and mail it in. She said the only way they would do the taxes was if I paid out of pocket $650.00. I have never had to pay that much money to file a basic tax return. Then she said if I found another tax preparation center that charged less, they would beat their price. When I went back and said I found a place that would do my taxes for $100 the lady was furious and called me a liar and held my tax paper work hostage and still will not return it to me. I then went online to find the corporate number and called them. They said they could do nothing and I had to contact the manager/supervisor of that office. Sadly that was the lady that is holding my tax papers hostage and I can't file my taxes because she has them and will not return them to me. When I told corporate that they said they can't do anything, I have to go and talk to the manager. They wouldn't even listen to what I had to say. I've went to H&R Block for years, I told the individual at the corporate office. They said if unhappy, then to take my business elsewhere. How can I when my paperwork is being held hostage? They have papers I cannot just go and get duplicate copies made of. Some can be requested, which will take time, but others I cannot and if I get audited, I will not have the proper paperwork to support my business and medical deductions. Everyone should boycott this company and go elsewhere before something horrible happens to you there. I believe the lady wanted to charge me the out-of-pocket cash, instead of getting the money out of refund anticipation check, to keep it herself because she is the office manager and who would ever know. Corporate obviously doesn't care what she does. I wonder how many other people she has scammed out of hundreds of dollars? All it takes is few and the tally adds up to thousands of dollars tax-free in her pocket. It's sick and this should be stopped A.S.A.P. read more hide
I always had my taxes done at H&R Block, always got my money within a week. Here I sit 2 weeks after they were put in still no money. I paid $340 to have them done and get me my money asap. Well everyone I know used other tax programs and have both state and federal back within a week and spent $10 to file, so needless to say I'm upset and will never give them another dime. In fact spent last weekend outside the local office telling everyone not to go there. You won't get your money when they say and to just use TurboTax you will have both within a week and it's a fraction of the price. I've filed complaints and H&R Block refuses to give me my money back. So much for 100% satisfaction guarantee. SO I CAN NOT STRESS IT ENOUGH SAVE YOUR MONEY AND TIME. NEVER EVER GO TO H&R BLOCK. THEY ARE THIEVES!!!! read more hide
I am an Emerald cardholder and had no problem with them until today. I couldn't access my bank account so I call a representative.

I was told that my credit score would not have anything to do with getting the RAL because H&R block goes off your tax refund. I applied for the Ral loan and was denied due to issues with my credit report... I was not at all shocked about the credit report but I was shocked that they lied and ran my report and I was not able to get the loan. Furthermore, I think this program is full of BS. How are you going to do credit checks on people who are trying to get a loan off THEIR refund money? Just highway robbery if you ask me. read more hide

Applied for a loan as I always do at this time of year and was denied for information that is not on my experian report that h&r block claimed was there. I checked with the reporting agency and was told that it was not there. Said info is an unsatisfied auto loan which I have no clue as to where they are getting this info and when asked about it they informed me that it was something the underwriters found and when asked to speak to underwriter who found this info to bring about some accountability to furnish to Experian, I was told they don’t have that information. The same info that was used to determine my denial is the information that h&r does not have or refused to furnish. read more hide
I was looking for an RAL at H&R Block. They had a program referred to as the Emerald Program, which they will prepare your loan and taxes from your last check stub and you can get $1,000.00 from them with the plan to return, and they complete your taxes and you can repay the money back. Well, I had to make an appointment in order to apply for the program. Well I made my appointment, went to my appointment, and only to find out that I could only get the $350.00 from the program and not the $1,000.00 they claimed according to the website. It states "New customers are welcome." Within that new customer, it did not state you had to be an established client to get the $1,000.00 from the Emerald Program. So I declined on the whole idea. False advertisement from H&R Block. Don't waste your time. Go somewhere else. read more hide
I use to get a Christmas loan every November from H&R block until last year, when they denied me a loan. They denied me because supposedly I purchased a product from Amazon that was 80.00. I know for a fact if you purchase anything with the emerald advance, it will deny your transaction if there isn't enough on the card, so how is it possible. The main thing that has my suspicions going is I never ever received a bill for this. This supposedly happened in 2013 and still no bill in the mail. When you call to talk to someone, it's always someone from outside the U.S. H&R block should be doing their own investigation because I'm not the only one with this issue. Someone suggested I file a complaint with the FTC. Going to get started on that today. read more hide
My wife and I did our taxes with H&R Block located on Ashlan and Fowler in Fresno, Ca. on 8-30-2014 after paying H&R Block $49.00 to file an extension for us back in April. This amount was to be applied when doing our taxes with them but our preparer only applied $20.00 and we did not find out till much later because he did not include a receipt for services with our finished taxes. Our preparer also used the address of a house that he knew we sold 9 months prior and not the new address that we provided him with when doing our taxes. When four weeks past and we did not receive our RAC check in the mail, we contacted the IRS and they informed us that the funds in the amount of $3,906 was electronically transferred to H&R Block Bank back on 9-10-2014. Now H&R Block was to receive out of these funds $418.75 (overcharged) for the preparation, plus $54.95 for the bank fees. So that left us with a missing check in the amount of $3,432.30 and we had to contact the new owners of our sold property to see if they had received it. We come to find out it was mailed in an H&R Block envelope with nothing indicating refund and it was thrown away because the new owners thought it was just junk mail. Not their fault. So now H&R Block gives us the runaround for another couple weeks telling us we have to wait for this thrown out check to expire before they can reissue. We finally got through to someone over the phone who told us there is a form we can have filed for us by the office at H&R block for a reissue of the check. We went there and they say only one person knows how to do this in their office, with which we sat down with this Tax Person and we filled out all the forms, signed and dated, etc... and before he goes to fax it I notice that on the form it asks for his tax office ID, his Tax Preparer ID and a signature. I ask if he needs to sign this. He says no then goes off to fax it. He states we should receive it in about two weeks. Two weeks, no check. We call 1-800 number for H&R Block and are told that nothing has been done because he did not fill out his portion of the paperwork. Back down to H&R Block to get his signature and info on the paperwork and re-fax now only to be told again that we have to wait till the first check expires. We were told now by the Bank Representative that if the manager sends them a form and letter that they can expedite it but the bank manager is either so slow or just plain not working on our issue in order to get this resolved because, it has now been two more days and we had to call them again (when I was told I would receive a call from them two days earlier) in order to find out that they have been too busy to do it yet. My wife and I will never go to H&R Block again. Way too many mistakes made by them for one year's tax preparations. Holding our funds hostage while they use our money to make loans to others using their H&R Block Credit Card at 35% interest. What a tragic miscarriage of our banking institutions. read more hide

What a crock! When I did my taxes for 2013 H&R Block told me in no less terms, their Bank Card was the best Check to Card, and other programs they offer. They then told me it was quick (less than 15 minutes to review and place the check on my card), so I was a little iffy. But I thought why not, so I placed a check my Mother sent me on the card. 15 minutes passed, nothing, another 15 minutes passed and I got your check is still under review. So I proceed to call H&R Block and inquire why it's taking so long, they told me there is an issue with the H&R Block Bank Program and I should wait an Hour... 2 Hours later still waiting so I called again. Got someone on the line who proceeded to tell me it could take 5 DAYS for them to process this check. 5 DAYS! I was livid, I cancel my card and went back to BOFA, I put the check on that card, took 5 Minutes and was done! read more hide

I asked clearly if they were offering holiday loans or RALS this year. They told me yes and tried to have me apply for a credit card instead... WHAT? This is not a tax loan, this is a high interest credit card. Needless to say, I was denied for the credit card so I told them I would take my business elsewhere but they already filed my taxes. I was finally able to find a refund anticipation loan company this last year and I will never do business with H&R Block again. They lie. They try to tell me I am receiving a RAC. What is this, that is the same check I would have gotten if I filed using Turbo Tax. If anyone else had this experience please contact the corporate H&R Block office because the local offices are lying.

My fiancee is incarcerated. We’ve been together for 5 years and since he wasn’t able to go do his own tax return, he signed a power of attorney paper and it was notarized. Ok, so I went to H&R Block because they said they would withhold filing fees from his refund. Mind you, I e-filed. They only want one W2/W4 to file on unemployment and that's it. It should’ve been short, sweet, fast and easy. Ok, I gave them all the information and I filed them. I signed all the papers with his name by my name. Ok, no problem. I got the state return probably within a couple weeks. On the 21st day or 22nd, they said they had to re-mail the power of attorney paper through the mail because they must not have gotten it, or they lost it. They said it would probably be another 3 to 4 weeks from then. Months go by, still no refund. I called them, and they’re rude and hateful. They would not try to help me figure out why he hadn’t gotten it yet. They could’ve called IRS and got through to talk to them to find out what the holdup was, but no, they wouldn’t even return my phone calls. Well, the office I went to is now closed, and I still have not gotten his refund. Still no letter from the IRS either. I filed on February 1, 2013. My daughter and her husband filed a week after me. They had two different student loans, a new baby and some job W2/W4's. They got their return like in April, I think. WOW! WTH? So what do I do now? The IRS won’t tell me why they haven’t sent anything, or why he hasn’t received no letter or anything. I am not him, and they can only talk to him... Wow! Really? I WILL NEVER USE H&R BLOCK EVER AGAIN IN MY LIFE, NOT EVEN IF IT WAS A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH...VERY DISSATISFIED…THEY RATE A 0! read more hide
Tax problems with H&R Block - My wife and I had our taxes done in 2010 through a friend (so we thought was a friend) named Mary Jane **. We had both typed a letter of our deductions, as we always do, and gave it to her to make it easier on her to do our taxes. However, in January 2013, we received a letter that we were being audited for 2010 with regard to our deductions. We took our letter to H&R Block's Carolyn**, who reported Mary Jane ** and had been let go in 2010. Many of her clients were getting audited. We thought this was odd considering she did our taxes in 2011 through H&R Block. Anyway, Carolyn got to looking at our taxes and Jane had put many false claims regarding deductions. We even showed Carolyn the typed out paper we gave Mary Jane regarding the deductions. We wanted to claim that didn't even come close to the amount of money she put down for us to claim. Carolyn copied the deduction letter we had given Mary Jane ** and told us the "peace of mind" would cover us, and to look for check next week. Well, we never received a check but a letter from H&R Block saying they would not cover us. The IRS charged interest and back taxes that amounts to over $3,000. We have tried to complain and talked to Stephanie ** at Dixie Maner location in Louisville, KY. However, they have only returned call once and acted as if they do not care. Can we fight this in court? Also, I found out later that Mary Jane had our taxes in 2011 done through her friends at H&R Block at 5338 S Third St. Ste 100, Louisville 40214. She had also got our friends to join a pyramid scheme (while working at H&R Block) in order for people to claim more deduction. All of them are being audited. She tried to get us too at the 3rd St. location and we refused. I even thought it sounded very shady at the time. PS: I have last names but don't know if legally able to use? read more hide
Horrible! My mother had her taxes done here the past few years and things went okay. This year, however, the person preparing her taxes provided her completed paperwork that indicated her return would be upwards of $1,500, which it has been for the past few years. When it came time to receive her refund, she only received $300. The worst part took place when we tried to contact someone at the H&R Block at Temple Hills, MD. They were horrible at returning calls and were completely lazy and indifferent at the issue at hand. They, as in Tom **, the so-called site manager, kept telling her that her refund is $300 and provided no explanation as to why her tax preparer initially stated it would be $1,500. Instead of trying to explain things to her in a reasonable manner, the complete and total degenerate, whose name is Tom **, continued to make claims that it was somehow my mother's fault and she failed to perform certain steps. Clearly, he has no competence and decided to turn the whole thing around on her. I was there when she was speaking with Tom **, the site manager. When I spoke with him, he actually used profanity! Completely unprofessional and classless! I looked him up for the sake of curiosity and his picture certainly fits his conversational style - looks like a classless and out of shape degenerate. Don't ever do your taxes at this location. And judging by the comments, avoid all other locations as well. read more hide
I filed taxes, with education credits, on February 5th. Still no refund and I still cannot import tax return into the FAFSA. I'm not worried yet about the money. I am worried I will not be able to get the financial aid my son qualifies for! read more hide
I filed on February 7 and received an email confirmation from IRS on Feb 10 that they accepted my return. I'm not filing for the education credit but a form I had to file is looped into the education group. I had to pay to upgrade on the home edition to get this form. I too am still checking the status and it keeps saying it is being processed. I never received a letter, email or anything from either the IRS or H&R Block. It is now going on eleven weeks. It just infuriates me. It's my money and I want it now, or at least I should have had it well over 7 weeks ago! I file early and I use my tax return to pay my property taxes. My property taxes are now delinquent as of March 31. If H&R Block would not have screwed up, I would have had my tax return and my property taxes would be paid. I have done this for the past 13 years and I never had a problem until this year. What makes matters worse is that I never received any letter or email regarding this situation from either the IRS or H&R block! I learned about this whole situation through the news. It's pretty sad when they don't even keep their clients informed of what has happened. They just take your money and run leaving you to deal with the mess on your own. H&R block should pay everyone's refund to them and when we get ours back from the IRS, we will send it to H&R block. Who knows, we might have a computer glitch first to deal with before we can send it on them though. I will never use H&R Block again! I would not hesitate to be part of a class action suit against them. They have created a lot of undue stress and damage to honest hard working citizens and it should not be tolerated. read more hide
I filed my taxes with H&R Block on February 15th - after they were supposed to have resolved the problem with the Education Tax Credit. My federal return remains unprocessed. I have requested the local branch to return my $330 filing fee when the return is processed considering H&R Block was at fault for a problem they were aware occurred on their end. If a class action lawsuit is in the works, count me in! read more hide
I filed my refund this year and I had to wait for the IRS to accept the 8863 form. The IRS said that it's a problem within H&R Block software. This caused a delay in the refunds. I also have my payroll check automatically deposited with H&R Block Bank. If they know that there is a delay in the refund, please tell me why they took my payroll check. I just received an eviction from my home because of this matter and what do you think they are doing? They are telling me that there is a process I have to go through in order to get the funds put back onto my account. I'm going to be out on the streets when this process is still going on when they can click a button and put the funds back onto my account but no, they don't care. If I would have gone to another tax preparer, this wouldn't have happened so thanks to H&R Block, I'm out on the streets. read more hide
I stopped using H&R Block services for several years and, boy, did I regret going back. The "tax expert" ended up being a former co-worker (she & I worked retail together) so that should've been a sign of things to go wrong. I was charged over $200 (including fees). Three weeks went by with no refund. I called several times to speak to the "expert" but she was never available. When I finally got in touch with her, she couldn't explain why it was taking so long. She called me later only to blame it on the IRS. I later found out (via news) that H&R botched returns using the education credit so therefore the IRS was reviewing the return and I know I have to sit and wait for my refund which is already past a month since I filed. Needless to say, I would never use their services again. read more hide
I am in the same boat as everyone else. I have been using H&R Block for years with satisfaction but not anymore. I will not use them again. H&R block is the only company that did not update their software. I’ve called both several times and have never gotten the same answer twice at any time. It sounds like some sort of scam to me. I filed on Jan. 23. H&R Block did show me that my taxes were received, accepted and approved by the IRS on Jan 25. That’s not what the IRS said. No one is assuming responsibility for this mess. There are over 600,000 people waiting for their money and need it. A friend of mine may get put in foreclosure because of the delay. H&R block and the IRS are not on the same page with this. I think that if H&R Block is at fault, they should be liable for refunding everyone's money they paid for their service and should pay everyone their refunds. After all, we are the people suffering, not them. I was told there was nothing they could do, so I don’t know what to tell you. We should file a class action suit against H&R block. One time, I called the IRS and was told by the woman that they found an error in my return but they don’t know what it is? That’s like me saying I have $5 in my pocket, but I don’t have any money. If we, the $600,000, either owed the IRS or H&R Block money, I bet there would be no delay in their response. I’ve gotten the same response as everyone else. H&R block told me today that IRS told them it would be 4-6 weeks from Feb. 14. The IRS said it would be 4-6 weeks from Mar. 12. See, two different answers. I am very angry and there is nothing I can do. read more hide
I filed my taxes with H&R Block on January 23, paying $248 for preparation, with the understanding they wouldn’t be accepted till January 30. Later I was told because I had education credits, my return was not accepted till February 14. The twenty-one days have come and gone. I called H&R Block several times and they always say, “Maybe you will get it next week.” I called the IRS myself on March 21 and was told because of the glitch with H&R Block system, I was definitely one of those being affected by the long delay in my return being processed. According to the IRS, it could be an additional 4-6 weeks from March 11 before I see my return. read more hide
My taxes were prepared by an H&R Block professional on February 13th. They were accepted by the IRS on February 16th. Three weeks later, my refund was still in processing status so I asked my tax professional if there was a reason it had not been processed. She told me that it was 21 business days, not calendar days. I assumed she was correct because she is a professional. I waited another week. I had then heard about the problem with the school credit submission and saw on H&R Block website the letter from the CEO that they had made an error. Armed with this new info, I called the IRS and found out that indeed I was one of the 600,000 lucky ones. I went back to my tax professional to ask if there was a reason for the delay. She went so far out of her way to look up my status on the H&R Block site (something anyone can do) and tell me, "Nope, everything is okay and you were not affected. It says right here on the screen that it was accepted on Feb. 16th." I told her that I called the IRS and they told me I would be delayed because of the error made by H&R Block (you know, the one the CEO admitted to on Facebook but apparently failed to tell anyone working for him). Her response, "You could not have been affected because if there was any problem, we would have told you." And again, she backed that up by looking at their website and saying, "See here, it says accepted 2/16." Now when I looked at it, it says accepted 3/18. Hmm, big difference. I asked my professional about it and she said, "Nope, it says right here you were accepted on 3/18, so no problems." I said you prepared it on 2/13, why is it now accepted on 3/18 over a month later. Her reply, "IRS must be slow." She will not even admit to the fact that the date changed. As far as she is concerned, she prepared it on 2/13 and the IRS took over a month to accept it. I called H&R Block to file a complaint and was given a complaint number and told a complaint supervisor would call to get the details of the complaint. Guess what, I now have four complaint numbers and have yet to be called back as promised by any of them. How can a business be allowed to operate like this? I put a post on H&R Block's Facebook page stating that I believe that a percentage of the filing fees should be refunded. Their answer, delete my post and prevent me from posting anymore on their page. Such wonderful customer service. read more hide
I have been filing with H&R Block for over 3 years. I filed my 2012 taxes on February 13th. IRS didn't accept my return until the 15th. Twenty one days came and there was no refund, no status change, and no call from H&R Block. I heard from my family member that H&R Block messed up on returns. I called the corporate office in Kansas and they said there was an error between the two systems, and they can put me down for a complaint. I told them I want my tax fees returned to me. I made a call to the office, and they claimed that it wasn't their fault and it was the IRS’ fault. I asked why they didn't call or send an email; they couldn't answer that. Every week, I call each company and they’re on the same **. I talked to the manager on 03/22, and she tried to help. She said that when I get my refund, I should call her back and they will see what they can do. It’s just not their company; it’s others too. I just let her lie because when I get money, which was finally approved on 3/23 and I still have to wait until the 27th to get to my card, I'm going to give them a piece of my mind and demand that I get my tax fees refunded back to me immediately! All I can say is keep calling them and just hang in there; I waited over a month. I just relocated from North Carolina back to Ohio, and I'm not working so you know how frustrating it is for me still until I have my money in my hands! read more hide
For real? Over a half million people getting shafted on our taxes? The same money the IRS has used all year for free with no interest paid? The same money we had to pay to file and get back "faster"? Okay, so does this mean an all out class action lawsuit or is H&R Blockheads refunding us with a little incentive to even think about returning. I mean they have the "accuracy" test at the end of the preparation and a test for audit. I want my money back and extra for not being able to pay for school, bills, etc. Thanks for nothing H&R Blockheads. More than likely you won't take care of us little guys, but should take a hardcore look at what you stand to lose. I see you going down, down, down. Half million people times all those fees you won't get next year. Ha! read more hide
Upset with entire situation. All of my friends who used Turbo Tax have gotten their refunds... I am still waiting even though I paid H&R Block $300 to do my refund. I called and they told me they do not know when I will receive my money; I have to call the IRS. I thought the whole point of paying someone to do you taxes was so you did not have to deal with the IRS. If I had filed for free or it was $50, no big deal. I would not mind an error or having to wait. But the fact is I paid a lot of money. I work in customer service, and if I did something like this and did not compensate the customer for my error, I would lose their business. Therefore, I will not be returning to H&R Block in future years... Looks like Turbo Tax will make a lot more money next year! read more hide
This was my first year doing my taxes on my own. Usually I just went with where my parents went. Now I have been waiting for 5 weeks - no federal return. I got no emails or calls from them. So I call them and all they say is there was an error and they are fixing it. I have a 2 thousand dollar school bill here coming in 3 days. How am I supposed to pay this when I should have gotten my check like everyone else did 21 days after they file? I will never be going back to H&R Block. I believe they should return our tax fees that they charged for prep. read more hide
We have used H&R Block at home for the last three years. This year we filed on January 1st and it was not put through until the 14th of February. And now the 18th of March, we are still waiting for our tax return. We were told that there was an error in the H&R Block software and the education credit form, and we are going to be waiting until April 24th at the earliest to see our tax return. And even then, they want to hold our money for up to seven days more before sending it to our bank. We will not be using this company to file our taxes ever again. They never called us to let us know there were any problems. And when we contacted them, they had no information to give us and were unhelpful and would not admit any fault was theirs. read more hide
Just to start, I have been filing with this company for the past 4 years and I will never file with them again. I filed my taxes this year on Feb 3, 2013, with the 8863 educational form. Today is March 18, 2013 and I still haven’t received my refund. I noticed something was wrong when I noticed on the “Where’s My Refund” website that mine didn’t have any approval date as to when my refund would be in my hands. I called the IRS number and waited 2 hours to talk to someone who barely spoke English. She then told me my return had an error. She didn’t know what it was or what was going on but that I should receive a letter in the mail stating what the problem was and then I can move forward and fix it - that’s when I lost it with her. There’s no way I’m going to wait 2 weeks for a freaking piece of paper to tell me what the error was on my return when I had her there on the phone. I just hung up on her because she just sucked over all. I don’t even know how they could hire someone that stupid. I continued to call H&R Block to get info. They finally told me there was some type of error, but don’t lose hope, keep checking every day. Well, I’m still checking and it states my return is still being processed. I will never go back here again, and I do plan to take legal action against this terrible company. I have now waited since Feb 3, 2013 and still haven’t received any type of money. read more hide
I have used H&R Block Offices in upstate New York in the Queensbury area for years - this will be the last. I went and filed my taxes on January 16, 2013. Being a single mother, I liked the fact that they have stated over the years; get your returns faster and back within 21 days. This year, they are a joke. I have been waiting 3 months for my return. I did my return and filed it on the 31st of January when the IRS opened to accept returns. Weeks went by and still no return. I called and they said they were sorry, but the return can't be filed because the college credit paperwork was not ready. Now I have to wait until the 15th of February to file my federal. It's nice of them to know this information when doing your taxes and not even call to let the customer know. What nice customer service! So every time I have gone to the office or called, they quote some written statement which is not even an answer to when my return will be back. In closing, I spent $300 for services that I never received, and my questions never answered. I could have waited and done my taxes myself this year like I did for my son, who got his return back in two weeks, with no charges to put on his return on the H&R Block card, but that's another $39-$40 charge I had to pay. I don't understand how using the same company, in person and online, could be so different. I am so angry that a company would do what they do and not have to answer for their wrong doings. It's just another United States company taking from the people who make the world go round. Just remember H&R Block, without us you have nothing! You need to take a big look at yourself, you're there to help, not hinder. I'm sorry but I am probably one of many who will not be a returning customer. Still no return as of March 16, 2013, and no answers as to when, but they got their money. It would be nice to have mine. They told me the 8th - pretty sad. Never again! I hope people out there take a stand. If you don't use them again, then they will reap that they have sowed. The little people have to take a stand. Do it now! read more hide
I filed my return in early February and was told it would only take 21 days to get my return. I called H&R Block and they said it was the IRS' error. I was on hold for 1 hour and finally spoke with the IRS to find out it was an H&R Block error! Now due to their software glitch, I will not get my refund for another 6 weeks! read more hide
I had my income tax prepared in the H&R Block office in PA and it was supposed to be direct deposited in my checking account. H&R says that maybe the numbers were off and it couldn't be deposited and in that case it would have been sent to the office where the return was prepared on Feb. 22, 2013. I called my bank and she said that they would have seen where the IRS would have tried to deposit it, but no signs of that happening. So, he (from the PA office) said he would send the check to corporate where they would issue a new check to send to me in another state. I called today, which is two weeks later, and no check came to them. I've called the H&R bank several times, the escalation dept. that is supposed to be working on my account (and she is rude) several times, and also customer service numerous times, and no one ever calls me back when they say they will. They have no idea where my check is. H&R in PA sent the check out weeks ago and now the H&R Block wants me to sign a check replacement form, which could take 3 more months. My question is, why wasn't I aware of this form? And I already gave all of my information to my local H&R office where the check is supposed to be sent? It seems to be that H&R took their fees out of a check I am not in possession of. I am so frustrated because I never get any calls back and I have no idea what they did with my Federal Income Return. read more hide
I filed with H & R Block on Jan. 28th, then got information on Feb. 14th. It was finally accepted. Now it is 20 "business days" since Feb. 14th and still nothing except since they have run out of time, they're blaming everyone else. I needed my refund weeks ago and want it now, as well as my $300 filing fee back. This is BS. read more hide
I have also used H&R Block forever. I have never had a problem getting my refund on time. I am in school and I am one of 600,000 whose returns are being delayed because of my educational funding. I filed my taxes at the end of January and expected my return in 21 days. Then I received a letter from the IRS about the form 8863, I guess, in regards to my educational expenses. I needed the money to pay my balance at school, but guess what? I'm still waiting on my return. I am upset and I know things happen, but I agree that they should refund some of our preparation money back. I'm very unhappy. read more hide
I filed my taxes in January and was told the education credit wasn't being accepted until mid-February. On the 14th, they were filed so 21 days later, I should have my refund. No! It's past the 21-day mark and when I called the IRS, I was told that the return had been kicked out of the system and I had to wait another 3 weeks or more to get my refund. Now I have heard on the news that it was H&R Block (heads) that messed up and they didn't even have the decency to call, email, send a letter, to let me know what was going on. I did receive an email telling me me today that there was an issue with, "Certain Education Tax Credits" and that they were doing "everything possible" to fix it. Where does that leave me and my bills though? When am I going to get my return? Why weren't the changes made in the software? But more importantly, why didn't they tell anyone that changes were made at all and my return might be delayed? I can understand if it were the IRS making changes, but not to be informed by H&R Block is unacceptable customer service. read more hide
I have filed with H&R Block for previous years, and the experience has been okay. Now this year, I filed with them and have been waiting over 26 days for a refund. I check "Where is my Refund?" and it states still processing. I called H&R Block last week to see what is going on, and I was transferred to a voicemail. I left a detailed message and a call back number, and three business days later, still no word. I found out by watching the news that there was a computer glitch for H&R Block customers that filed the 8863 education credit before Feb. 22. That means my taxes are in that bunch. The part that bothers me is that H&R Block didn't have the decency to inform their customers of the problem. I had to research it. I want my money back that I paid them to file my taxes. I will never use their services again, and I think all of us having this problem should file a civil lawsuit to get our filing and preparer’s fees back. I think that H&R Block has been negligent to its customers, not informing them of problems and for not having a backup plan in case something should happen... like a computer glitch. read more hide
We filed our taxes with H&R Block after a couple of years of just doing them online. After being told we would have our refund in 8 to 21 days, it has now been over a month. After calling to see what the problem was, I was spoken to very rudely, stating that she didn't know where my taxes were and didn't have any control over that. I asked specifically, "Would 21 days be the latest when we filed?" And I was told yes. It seems they were so willing to do your taxes and get their money, but once they have their money, they really don't have to be nice to the customer anymore. I think the higher ups need to sit down and ask if lying to get one year of business then losing it forever is worth it? So now they have lost my business and I hope many more will follow. read more hide
I filed for my return with H&R Block & through a mistake on their part, I still haven't received my return! Now, I found out I had received my state taxes & they took it for their fees! I wasn't even going to pay them because of them entering wrong SSI number & causing the delay! read more hide
I've gone to H&R Block for years and never had issues. Now, I feel bad having people go there this year. I paid over $300 so I can get my money at a timely fashion and not have to deal with the IRS. Every year I get money in 2 days. This year they said 8-10 days. That's not the problem. I did it on Feb. 5. It's now March 3. I called them and they said it could take 21 days. Wouldn't that be the 26th? Now, they don't know where my money is and told me to call IRS. What? But that's what I paid them for. But all they can say is call IRS. I tried to complain, but that's all they say. I will not be going back and I know a lot more who are not. They will go out of business here because they can't give a straight answer and do what we pay them to do! read more hide
The tax expert wrote my check number and only part of my routing number. I wondered why it was taking so long to get my refund. Now, I have to go back to H and R Block. I am not looking forward to this as they will most likely tell me it is my fault. I just want them to fix it and not charge me anymore. This has made me rethink if I will return for my 2013 return, even after many years with H and R. read more hide
I have gone to H&R Block for nearly 20 years.The last few years, I have received my refund on the Emerald Card, which has been no problem. I always received it pretty quickly. Until this year, that is. I had my taxes done back in mid-January and still have no funds yet. I don't know what has changed. My brother sent me an article from the Chicago Tribune saying that due to the fiscal cliff arguments at the end of last year, people are not getting their tax refunds as quickly. That may be true, but if that's the case, please explain to me why three of my friends did their taxes online at Turbo Tax and received their refunds in under two weeks. It didn't matter that much in past years how quickly I received my refund. I like to get it as soon as I can, hence, the Emerald Card choice. But this year, due to a host of medical problems and surgeries and switching jobs, I needed my refund asap. I'm pretty much done with H&R Block after this year. I had a few problems with them in past years, but nothing that truly made me angry. After all I've been through and the slow speed of my refund this year, I definitely think I'm switching to Turbo Tax online next year. read more hide
I've been a loyal customer for 20 yrs. but this will be my last. For the last 3 yrs, I feel I got overcharged. They let you sit there until the very end and you pay for what you think will get you your taxes sooner. They fail to inform you that you won't be getting your taxes in a matter of two to three days but, in fact, what you paid for was actually the same time frame the IRS releases funds anyway. Then they don't tell you about any delays that the IRS is having so now thinking that I'm getting a refund within a week or so. Now, I have to wait until almost April. It's like **? I should have paper filed and snail mailed it then. I know H&R Block has no control over the IRS, but they knew all this before we eFiled. They had to but they failed to inform people just to keep money for themselves. read more hide
I went to go file my taxes and when the guy gave me the amount of my refund, I was in shock. I was actually getting back $251 less than from the year before, and I made more money last year than 2011. I even included my student loans. I can't even imagine what the amount would've been had I not included my loans. Let's just say, I would be getting back two weeks' worth of pay if I worked in a retail store. I asked the guy why I would be getting back less this year, and he said because I'm making more money, the state is taking out more taxes, and some other foolishness. I left and I'm going to an actual IRS office for them to do my taxes. read more hide
Emerald Loan - I’ve been filing with H&R Block for thirteen yrs. My card was charged without my knowledge. I got the card charge reversed because it was someone else’s fault and they still denied the loan for the same reason. Everyone acted dumb like they didn’t know what was going on. If I got denied for a negative balance and the application was so called reset, there should have been another reason. I do not feel good with you guys anymore and will be taking my business elsewhere. I didn’t know that you guys didn’t care. I feel I will be going elsewhere after 13 yrs. read more hide
I did my taxes in May. I was told I was going to pick up my check on June 6, but the office was closed that day. So, I went the following day. I called ahead to see if everything was okay. The receptionist said, “Oh, I have to call you back in a bit to see were your check is." So, I waited for 2 hours and there was no phone call back. I just showed up at the office and asked, "What’s wrong?" Well, it turned out that June 6 was the last day the office could print out the check, but since the manager went off on vacation, “She forgot to tell someone to come in and print them out.” That’s from what the receptionist told me and she won’t be back until the following week and the bank is going to print it out for me and I will receive it by June 17, 2012. I did call to talk to the manager when she came back and she blamed the IRS and said I couldn’t get a refund, but I contacted the IRS and they told me they deposited the money to H&R Block’s bank account on the 6th of June. It even said so on their website. The manager basically did not want to deal with me and brushed me off. The 17th of June comes by - no check. The 17th was a Sunday. I figured, well, the post office is closed, so I’ll wait till next day. There’s still no check. To make it worse, I couldn’t call since the office was closed on a Monday. I had to wait again another day. I called on Tuesday morning, June 19th. I talked to the receptionist. She was surprised that I haven’t received it yet. She gave me the bank's number. I called and the bank told me their last day for that office to print out my check was the 7th of June, not the 6th, and that they lied to me and the bank has not printed out my check. My check is just sitting there waiting to be printed. The bank told me it is gong to take 3-5 business days to print out and by mail about 3 weeks more. I called today, June 28, and the bank tells me I’ll get my check by the 8th of July. Let’s see what happens. I’ve asked for a refund back, but H&R Block doesn’t want to refund me money. This is the last time I will go to H&R Block. read more hide
I met with an H&R representative early in March and was told she would review my last 3 years' taxes for free. She explained how busy she was, but promised to review my 2008 taxes before April 15th when the chance to amend them would end. She didn't do as she promised and I lost a $10,000 tax deduction because of it! In addition, she never called me even though I left several messages for her. They don't keep regular hours after April 15 and the phone number goes to service somewhere out of state. I finally called when someone was there and was told they were booked that week. I had to explain again and again that I wanted an appointment, at a later date then. She scheduled me for Memorial Day even when I told her that was a holiday, and I accepted the appointment with no other options offered. That was cancelled, of course, but at least they called me. When I finally met with her, she kept me waiting for 45 minutes. Admitting she didn't do the 2008 taxes in time so I couldn't claim the $10,000 tax deduction. She promised to finish the 2009 and 2010 tax review and call me within a week. Nope. I'm still waiting and am back to calling the phone number until someone at the local office answers the phone! read more hide
We filed our taxes on February 20, and we had the runaround of checking where my refund was online. We were supposed to get our refund on March 5, according to H&R Block on our papers. Then, it went to March 13, then the 20th, then the 27th; and then it went back to the 20th of March. Then all of a sudden, the thing said my taxes have been received and was being processed. Then I checked, and it said I should receive my tax refund on May 8. But then, I checked and it said we owe $145, when we were supposed to receive $3591. When we called IRS, they said a number H&R Block entered wasn't in the right spot and that we now have to send additional paperwork to IRS and hope we get our money! We have used H&R Block for 8 years that we were together, and we each had used it years prior. I'm not understanding why they are so screwed up! I won't use them any longer! read more hide
H&R Block filed my 2010 taxes with the Peace of Mind guarantee. I got audited and the IRS found my taxes were wrong by some $30,000. I filed for peace of mind reimbursement and I am still waiting for the outcome. They are saying I need to show my 2006 taxes, but I do not have them. The adoption credit was filed on my 2010 taxes, but it was filed by the tax advisor for $48,537, which was wrong. At the end of December 2011, I finally got a tax refund from IRS, but I have not had any satisfaction on the Peace of Mind program I paid H&R Block to file for me. read more hide
H&R Block filed my taxes on Jan. 24, 2012. My direct deposit for federal was not deposited within the 2 weeks. I called IRS and was told Discrepancy in Income. Due to H&R Block preparer had put business loss as income. Per H&R Block, they did nothing wrong. I paid $364.00 for taxes and still no tax refund as of March 28, 2012. Here are 2 numbers to call to get information! IRS Number is 1-800-829-1040. Press 00# and wait until someone answers. This will bypass the computerized messages. You can also ask for someone in the accounting office. Also, here is the number to the corporate office of H&R Block, 1-800-472-5625 and you can file a complaint with them on your refund. Please check your summary sheet report and compare the figures and where they are placed on your tax papers. The error of my taxes was where they put NOL and amount on other income instead of business loss/ Lines 12 and 21. Good Luck, I will never use this company again and will never recommend them to anyone. Also, I was lied to and had to put up with attitudes. They still say they did no wrong. Then they called to offer me a refund for what I paid to have taxes filled out via H&R Block. But beware. They told me if I accepted this refund, then they will not be responsible for my taxes nor my refund. So do not accept this. They are responsible for your tax return and refund. So don’t be fooled! read more hide
We filed our taxes on 2-6-12; afterwards, we were told we would have our taxes back by 2-15-12 and was expected to pay $300 for them to prepare. The 15th came and I called the office. The lady said that there was a glitch in the system with IRS and I should have it any day now. I called everyday for the next week to see if they have received "any" checks to be printed and the same lady claimed that she had not received any checks in yet. I was told to call the 866 number to call on the card they give you after you file. Basically, they are trying to blow us off and said if the message said that there was a check ready, there would be one waiting for us at the office. The IRS site said I would have direct deposit by 2-28. That day came and nothing. H&R claimed they never received any checks. I said to the lady, "So, I don't have to pay for the $300 processing fee then since that my promised and expected date has now went over 21 days." The woman told me that I still have to pay and it's IRS's fault, not theirs. They never told me when I would get my taxes back when I filed with them because it's against the law for them to tell us a certain date. I called her out on that lie and even said that the person that prepared my taxes even circled and highlighted the expected date of return. Here it is now the 15th of March and I still have not received anything and no one is trying to tell us anything. I want our $300 back. My landlord is throwing us out on the street now with our 3 kids since we were not able to pay our rent and my husband lost his job and there’s no tax return. read more hide
Taxes filled by H&R Block and I never received check. I filed taxes for 2012 on February 9, 2012. It is now March 15 and I still haven't received my tax check. I don't owe anyone. I'm irate! I will never have H&R Block prepare my taxes. Had I been lying, I would have never taken the time out to write a customer compliant. read more hide
On Monday, February 13, 2012, I went into H&R Block in Monroe, NY to have my taxes done. Upon sitting down with the agent, I inquired of the price I would be charged to have my taxes prepared. The agent informed that she was unable to give me that information because the computer generates the price according to the number of pages used. At the end of the session, I was charged $373. I was not expecting this amount. I feel the agents at H&R Block are misleading people into getting their taxes done and once your taxes are done, forcing you to pay outrageous prices for your taxes. I should have been given the opportunity to decline this amount but was forced to pay because I would not get my taxes back. They advertise your refund will be issued within 10-14 days. It is now March 13, 2010 and I have yet to receive my refund. I now have to contact the IRS to ascertain the issue with my taxes. read more hide
H&R Block’s Emerald Card is a joke. This is my first time using H&R Block to prepare my taxes. Boy, was it the worst. I found out that I would be charged if I don't use my monies that were placed on their card in 90 days. If I transfer all my monies off their card into my checking out, they will also charge me a fee of $25. I not only don't get any interest on my monies if I don't touch it for a while, but I'm being punished if I don't use my monies. What kind of ** is this? This is nothing but a big scam. read more hide

We filed our 2011 taxes with H&R block this year. We have used them in the past, which was fine, but now, it's a different story. They pushed that stupid emerald card on us and said that we would get our tax money in 10-12 business days. Well guess what, we filed on February 4th and it is now March 9th, what a crock of ** they have fed us! We will never use those scam artists ever again. read more hide
I filed taxes on Feb.10. I gave wrong account. I called right back and gave the new one. I was reassured there was no problem. On Feb. 11, I gave check again and I was told no problem. It will be in right on the account. On Feb. 22, I received email saying check was deposited. I haven't received it. H&R Block didn't turn in new account until Feb.16. The bank can't do anything. Toll was returned. For two weeks, I called the bank and different stories every day. Yvette said it will be fixed, but nothing. I get no phone calls from H&R Block or the bank. No one is helping. They just say I have to wait. I'm tired of waiting its poor customer service and I paid $250 to get my taxes done. I want my money back. I'm tired of getting the run around. read more hide
I went into H&R Block on February 3 to have my taxes filed. I was told by the lady that filed my taxes that I should receive my "Refund Anticipation" funds by the 21st. After the 21st, I called them and they have been giving me the runaround. They charged me to direct deposit the RAC and after speaking to them once again today, they notified me they will only give money after the IRS deposits money into their account. For one, that is not a Refund Anticipation check. That is simply charging me so they can be the middle man. Their website says the IRS accepted my return and to expect it in 7-14 days. That was the status of the return last month. I am angry that people who filed after me at other companies already received their money and here I am, waiting on the money to pay my bills. Had I not been misled by their advertisements and the person who filed my taxes, I wouldn't be waiting. They are lying to their customers and something needs to be done. They would hold me to any contract and they should do the same. read more hide
I have been an H&R Block customer for almost as long as I've been married and working for that matter. They always have had astronomical fees but now, it's ridiculous! For the last couple of years it's been a nightmare. Refund anticipation (RAC) is a scam! They don't get you the refund any faster than regular e-file on the IRS website or even on their own Do-It-Yourself e-file online. They admitted it! Customer service told me there is no difference in the processing time, wait time, or refund amount in anyway than selecting regular e-file vs. RAC. The IRS confirmed this and so did the office employees after I spent well over $300 to do my return with RAC. Plus the return was late anyway. There is also no difference what so ever with getting it direct deposited on an Emerald Card vs. your checking account. That was also confirmed. If there is a law suit or complaint forum to get a refund of tax prep fees, please, someone post it! Even if we can get them to stop all this false advertising and erroneous fees let’s get it done! They should not be allowed to take advantage of people and commit fraud! Enough is enough! read more hide
My husband and I filed our taxes on 2/8/12 and we paid a $317 to have our refund in 10-14 days and when the 23rd came, we checked to see if the funds were on the emerald card like we expected. After several calls to the IRS and H&R Block, I still have no money and no date to expect my money. We paid almost $350 in fees and still don't have our money. We have a newborn baby and an 8-year old autistic child to care for and with this economy being so messed up. My husband lost his job so we are now two months behind on our rent and other bills and all we keep getting is excuse after excuse. Totally not fair. H&R Block needs to compensate their clients and refund them the money that we spent in fees to have our taxes back quicker. I will never use them as a tax preparer again! I'm absolutely disgusted! read more hide
Refund on emerald card - I went into my local H&R Block office on 1-29-12. I had the emerald card forced on me and I was told I would have my funds on Feb. 8th. I called back on 3-2-12 to find out why my emerald card still had a $0.00 balance. I was told that my money should have been deposited on 2-6-12. I told her that was not the case and was told to call the number on the back of the emerald card. I called the emerald card and they said they see when the money was supposed to come, but it never did. I was then told to call the IRS line, which doesn't allow me to talk to a person and when I put my information in the automated system, it has no record of my information. I called the local office back and they said they didn't no what to tell me. I don't know what to do at this point. read more hide
My refund was not deposited on the forced Emerald Card when the IRS said it was deposited February 29. So I waited till the next day to call H&R Block and they told me they had no idea where the money was and to call the “Where's my refund” line. I paid $300 for nothing. I will never use them again. I suggest no one else does, unless you want problems. I still have not got my money and it has bee a few days. read more hide
I’m waiting for my card to get money on it, which was supposed to be 2days ago (Feb. 29). So I came across this trying to figure out what’s going on and what I saw devastated me. One comment said if you call they’d admit it’d be 7-10 days later but blame it on the IRS. That happened. Not only should I have been told before filing with them, but there’s also the issue that it’s only H&R Block customers! And if my IRS status says "processed" before my money is on the card, I’ll be in on the lawsuit along with everyone else for theft by deception! $400 is not something I can afford to give away if not for the reason it’s perceived to be for! read more hide
I went into H & R block to have my taxes done on 02/02/2012. This was my first time using H & R Block, needless to say, I won't ever use them again.. I was told I would have my refund on my Emerald Card that was forced on me on 02/15/2012. I paid $317.00 just to be lied to. I called the office I used on 02/18/2012 to let them know the card balance was $0.00. Their exact words, “Well ma'am, I don't know what else to tell you, you can go online to www.irs.gov.” I called another H & R Block and asked how long did they know the IRS was backlogged. She informed me since the end of January. But yet they lie to their clients, so they will pay to have the refund anticipation loan. Two of my co-workers filed their taxes themselves on 02/06/2012 and received their direct deposit on 02/20/2012. H & R Block should have to refund all monies for the refund anticipation loans fees and charge only for regular file. I'm completely dissatisfied. read more hide

We have used H&R Block for several years without any problems until our 2011 Return. We had to keep correcting the tax professional's work and the excess fees that she wanted to charge. Then we had to pay extra for the direct deposit, so we could get our refund within 7-10 days. It has been 3 weeks and no refund. Then we find out there was a glitch with their software security and that is why the IRS had to re-process H&R Block's electronic returns. I feel we should get a refund for filing fees! read more hide

On my paperwork, I will get my refund on 2-15-12. It's now 2-25-12 and still no money. I filed my boyfriend's taxes on 2-5-12 and he received his money already. His were filed with FreeTaxUSA.com so when I called H&R Block, they said check where's my refund and guess what? The IRS had no info for me until 2-23-12. I don't understand how this is legal. H&R Block charges all this money and it takes longer than mailing in your taxes to the IRS. read more hide

I am irate at H&R Block. I went in to do my taxes on February 6th and was told that the glitch that had delayed taxes before we filed were being taken care of. We asked our agent if our taxes would be late, and she said that no, that everything was fine now with IRS. It is now February 24th and we still have not received our refund. Why do we have to pay H&R for filing our taxes electronically if we did not get them in a timely manner? This is bull, someone at H&R should have to take the heat over taking people's money when they knew that tax refunds were running late this year! read more hide
My wife and I filed our taxes at the local H and R Block on Feb. 3, 2012. We where told we would have our money by Feb,15,2012. I contacted the office on Feb 17, and asked them why my money had not been put on my emerald card. The lady said, I am sorry you haven't gotten your money, give it until the 20th and I am sure you will have your money. On the 20th, I checked the balance of my emerald card and my balance was still $0.00. I paid $317.00 to H & R Block to file my taxes and receive our refund within that 7-14 days they have led people to believe. On Feb. 21,2012, I went to the H&R Block office and the lady said, well I don't know why everyone is in a hurry to get there tax money because you use to have to wait 6-to 10 weeks or sometimes longer to get your refund. I thought for a minute and laughed and told the lady, yes, you are right and it only cost you $35.00 to do your taxes not $300 or more. She could see that she really made me even more mad. I told her, I promise you that I won't use H&R Block next year and I will discourage anyone from buying into there false promise. She told me that here is a website for the IRS and they are the ones who have your money, not us. I explained to her that I paid H&R Block to do my taxes not the IRS, H&R Block said 7-14 days and the IRS never promised me anything. After reading all the articles of all the dissatisfied customers of H&R Block, I have come to the conclusion that everyone should stand together and not allow companies to take advantage of American tax payers. I have read so many people's complaints and I am really sorry for people that only where getting a few hundred dollars and still paid an unbelievable fee. Today is February 24, 2012 and I have not received my refund, the IRS website says to expect it on or around March 6, 2012. This is far from what H&R Block led me to believe. read more hide

I've read the other customer complaints and mine is exactly the same. I'm just in Atlanta, GA. I've chosen H&R Block to prepare my taxes for several years now, and while I can't place all of the blame on your company, I do feel my expert tax professional should have said she wasn't sure when the date would be before I'd have my tax refund. She could've easily stated that she was uncertain, because the IRS was having some backlog problems. Ultimately, the IRS was who said it could take up to 21 days. I was also shocked, and appalled at all the new fees! OMG! This will be another reason for me to find solace in another option for filing my annual taxes; either by a private person, or one of your competitors. I was so excited when the preparer gave me a final total amount, and then she clicked to a page that showed fees for direct deposit, fees for just a GENERAL deposit or a check option, and then this Emerald credit card. My first mind told me to get up and leave after that, stupidly, I chose to just go with it. I feel badly for you H&R Block, because maybe you think this was a smart move, but I won't be one of the returning customers next year. I'm surprised, disappointed, and very dissatisfied. For the good of your business some portion of our H&R Block preparation fees should be returned to us, because we chose to do business STILL with your firm, company, franchise, or whatever it is called. I do believe however, you're gonna wind up losing many of your customers. read more hide
Me and my husband went to H&R Block and had our taxes done on February 4 .He had his put on the Emerald card because it was a faster refund and at the time was free. I had mine direct deposited. It cost him $180.00 to have his filed and he still hasn't gotten his refund, nor have I. He was suppose to have it on his card on the 15th and mine was to be in my account on the 17th. Here it is, the 23rd and still no money.

We had our taxes done at H&R Block. They charged us over $250. They practically forced the Emerald card down our throats. It takes forever to get our refund. Finally, it came, and we looked up where to pull our money out at. The ATM was an all point, like they said to us, and still they charged us a fee. After we complained to the office, the phone number they gave us, and the district office, all they can say is "we can't help you". H&R Block not only lied to us, but they stole money from us!

My husband and I filed our taxes with H&R Block on February 2 and we were told that our check was going to be in the bank (direct deposit) by February 21. We are still waiting. When I called, they blamed it on the IRS but here is my problem: Never did they tell us we would not get our refund until the IRS paid them. We signed a paper that said when our return was accepted by the IRS, H&R Block bank would then deposit a check in our account. Well our return was accepted at 12:21 am on February 3. Folks, we all need to get together and get a class action suit going against these lying **! Money is hard enough to come by.

Once before, I have had a problem with H&R Block. I did my taxes back in the 90's and now here I go again. I filed on Feb. 3, 2012 and was charged $260.00. I was told I will receive it on the 15th. Well, the 15th came and was told it will be another week the 21st. Now that date is here and I was told I will get it when I get it. In the past, H&R Block was known to keep people's refunds or take a large portion holding some for some reason or another and supposed to receive the rest at a later date. I hope this is not history repeating itself. For one year, H&R Block kept my whole taxes. They came up with one excuse after another. I've been a client of this company for many years after that. But I don't know how a person could file theirs a week after I did and did their x from home and I used H&R Block but still don't have mine yet. read more hide
My partner had a fairly simple tax to have done and was charged $194.00. That's outrageous. My granddaughter had a simple one also. She is poor and they charged her $250.00. A family of three with income less than $15,000 a year. I also personally know someone who had a very complicated one done and was only charged a little over $200.00. So what's up with that? How can they do that? They say you pay for each form they fill out--what a ** rip off. You can believe I am angry and more so after my granddaughter told me what she paid.

My taxes were done by H&R Block, on 2/1/2012. In the past, I have gotten the RAL through them. This year, expecting to do the same as usual, I was told after my taxes were done, that they don't have RAL any longer. It would have been nice to know, before filing. Then, they tell me my refund would take 2 weeks to get. I had no problem with that. I called H&R Block today, 2/22/2012, and the lady told me that I should now get it by 3/6/2012. I asked her how long the refunds have "actually" been taking, and now, after this long, she tells me 2 more weeks! Really, H&R Block! I paid $210.00 for what? A bunch of lies? This must be the corporate way to do things, because it's the same story all across the country, in all the H&R Blocks. I hope this bankrupts H&R Block! read more hide
I filed my 2011 taxes with H&R Block on February 3, 2012. I had mine directly deposited to my bank account. On February 4, I went back to H&R Block with the rest of my husband's info to file his. The preparer said it would be quicker and less expensive to use the Emerald Card, so I did that for my husband's return. What a mistake. I received my refund within a week. It is February 22, and my husband still doesn't have his refund on his Emerald Card, basically to try it out, because he has a bank account for direct deposit. I used Tax Act to file my daughter for $14.95 (state fee). It was rejected twice due to my error. Still, I received a check direct deposit within a week. Due to the Emerald Card experience, I will not be going back to H&R Block and because of the charges and dishonesty. H&R Block preparers, I am sure, get some kind of incentive (money, bonuses) to push this card. Something needs to be done about their practices. What can be done? read more hide

I filed my taxes on February 3 at the Belvidere location. I suspect that I did not receive the "maximum return possible." However, this is not my main concern. I had my taxes done at the same location by a different employee last year and received almost $800 from Federal. This year, I made almost $5,000 more and received almost $300 less. I did however win $5,000 additional on a scratch off, but I also claimed a child of 18 years of age. Now when filing my taxes this year, I was charged $218, as well as $35 for the "peace of mind" guarantee, all under the impression that I would be receiving a "fast return!" This however is not the case. I filed on the 3rd, and I was told to expect my return in 7-14 days. I received an email from H&R Block which said that my "refund had been accepted" on the 4th of February. However, it is now the 21st of February, and still, I hear nothing. No funds on my Emerald Card. I called H&R Block to ask them what the hold up was, and they promptly blamed it on the IRS. Everyone I have talked to recently who filed a week after me have already received their returns. I am extremely dissatisfied with H&R Block's performance, as well as their lack of knowledge of the whole situation. I will not be returning to H&R Block in the coming tax seasons. read more hide
I filed my return at HR Block for the first time (usually with Liberty Tax) on Saturday, February 4th, and was told that I will receive my refund by February 15th. I've attempted to check the status of my refund but of course my information can't be found. My HR Block representative can give me no information besides when she thinks I may receive my refund. I had the option of direct depositing my refund onto my debit card but the fees were ridiculous! It would have cost me well over $150, including the fee for my tax return. Next year Liberty Tax is going to be my choice of tax preparation like before. The fees are not too bad, dependents file for free, direct depositing was at no charge, and the refund comes back to you in a reasonable amount of time. HR Block needs to get rid of this Emerald Card because rather it being fast at retrieving your refund on time, and being convenient, it's the biggest headache of the tax season so far and it's only February. read more hide
Refund on Emerald Card is a lie! I filed my taxes with H&R Block on February 2 and paid $300 to get my taxes done. H&R Block said I would get my rapid refund on the Emerald Card on February 15. It is now February 21. They lie to their customers, and charging that much money is shameful. And then to lie! There should be repercussions. I have always done my own taxes along with my 2 daughters on TurboTax and have always got my taxes and theirs direct deposited into our bank accounts. I bought a home last year and wanted to be sure that my taxes would be done right, since I am a single mother and first-time homeowner. I was taken aback at the ridiculous price, when TurboTax is much cheaper. I should have done it on my own. I could have prepared my own taxes on TurboTax. Everyone was telling me such bad things about H&R Block, and now, how can I not agree? They charge ridiculous prices and lie about the rapid refund. I have it on my card and paper the tax preparer did. I have been reading the blogs on H&R Block and how they have lied to others about the rapid refund and the Emerald Card. I even got the card, so that they wouldn't charge me $35.00 to direct deposit into my bank account. I will never use H&R Block or recommend them to anyone. And I will write on every blog and Facebook what a deceiving, greedy, untrustworthy company you are! You need to reimburse every person whom you lied to. I want to be reimbursed for these problems you have caused and lied about. You have my information on how to contact me, and let's see what happens. What an overpricing and deceiving company.

Government should move to the Fair Tax, save everyone the hassle of this crap every year. read more hide
Did our taxes on Feb 2 was SOP to get them on the 15 direct deposited to my emerald card? Well I didn't get them so I get on IRS. gov and check my refund and it says march 6. That is like five weeks and that was supposed to be fast. I would like to know why I paid almost $400.00 to have them done when I have to wait five weeks. I could have done them myself for free and had them back all ready. read more hide
My daughter filed on Feb. 2, 2012 and was told that she would get it on Feb 15, 2012. Well, as you know they have given my daughter the run around and no check. So, I called their customer service and made a complaint. I told them how they lie about the 7 to 14 days, and found out it was really 7 to 21 days, and HR Block knew about this and that the IRS told them that they wouldn’t be done in 7 to 14 days on Jan 17. We will not be using their services ever again. read more hide
As of February 3, I went to H&R Block in Edison, NJ to have my taxes done, this is the first year I decided to go with them due to the fact that they offered a rapid refund. When I arrived, the women I worked with were helpful. However, I was given incorrect information. I applied for a rapid refund on an emerald card, which I was told could take up to 7-14 days and that includes weekends. Also on my tax papers, it shows Feb 15th as the day it should take up to, today is Feb19th and I'm still waiting. I was charged $300.00 for this so called rapid refund. Meanwhile, I'm reading and hearing several stories that people are getting their taxes back that filed after me and regular this does not make any sense. H& R Block is blaming the IRS stating that it's backlogged. How is this possible, when clearly, everyone else using other companies and doing their taxes on their own have gotten money back within a few days? i honestly believe that they should be refunding all customers suffering from this issue all the fees. People are paying for a service that they are not getting, and in return many people are suffering. I've gotten the run around from H& R Block and the IRS, no one has any info other the it will take longer then expected. Something needs to be done. I will not ever use this company again. read more hide
I visited my local H&R Block on 1/27/12, completed my return and then, the outrageous $228 fee was taken out of my return. I was promised that my return would be available on 2/8/12 via the emerald card. On 1/31/12, I was contacted by the manager of that office, and he stated there was an error with my husband's employer's EIN #. After asking him if he was sure that everything was entered correctly, he assured me that everything was fine, and that the employer knowingly submitted the incorrect number. He said that I would need to come in and pay the $228 in cash and then I could submit my taxes in the mail. It would take anywhere from 8-10 weeks to receive anything. I was so outraged that my husband's employer would pull something like this. So I went into his place of work and ** these people out for knowingly not providing this information when they handed out the W2. His employer then went to their private accountant and got the ball rolling with the IRS to figure out what was going on. After a week of his employer trying to work things out with the IRS, I get a call from his employer asking me for the contact information for the H&R block office we used. I gave him the information and about 10 minutes later, the employer calls back and says that the lady who handled my taxes did not submit the correct EIN #. Apparently, because it was the same company as last year, she didn't feel the need to double check the new W2. I could not believe that this whole situation could have been avoided as she would have done her job. I called the H&R block office to find out what happened and of course they have so many excuses--it's ridiculous. They submitted my return again and made sure it was accepted by the IRS. The manager from the office called to let me know it was accepted and that I should have the money on the card no later than 2/15/12. Well, it's now the 19th and I still have no money. I called back the office and they informed me the IRS was behind and I should have it no later than 2/22/12. I guess we'll see what happens when the 22nd rolls around. I am so disgusted with this whole process that I will never use this company again. And believe me, I will spread the word like wild fire. I went on the H&R Block website and after about 20 minutes of searching for their headquarters contact information, I finally found a number to call. I spoke to a nice young lady who helped me submit a complaint and was told someone will follow up within 3-5 days. I would strongly recommend everyone to file a complaint. Not that it's going to do any good, but at least they will have something on file. The number is 1-800-472-5625--option 0 to speak to a representative. read more hide
I went and filed with them the 4th and I am about ready to lose everything and they lie and rip people off. I won't be going back to them again. read more hide
On February 4th we filed electronically with H&R Block. We were told by our agent that a refund check will be at their office on or around February 15th. Now we're being told to check back on or around the 22nd. We paid $303 to get it back in 2 weeks or less. We feel that we should get a partial refund on that amount due to the fact that we feel they lied to us on the return time. Who wants someone to represent them if needed sometime down the road when they can't even keep their "promises" with what they say they will do from the very beginning? We will never use them again. read more hide
I filed on Feb. 4, 2012. I was told I'd get it by the 15th. Now, they're telling me the 28th! read more hide
I've been a customer for over 20 years. I filed on Feb. 2, 2012. They told me my check would be available by the 15th. Today is the 17th and no check. I called and ask if the IRS is delaying everyone’s money, would I be charged additional interest on my Emerald card balance because the balance was due on the 15th and to be paid off out of my return check. How freaking sorry is that? I will never return to their establishment again. I can do badly by myself. read more hide
Reading all these complaints is really upsetting me more. I did my taxes two weeks ago with H&R Block. I paid $100 with an emerald card. I was told it will take 7-10 days since it is a refund anticipation and nothing. The IRS has accepted it. If I have to wait this long, why the hell do they charge so much? read more hide
I am very elated and wondering why the IRS delay which should have only affected early filers has only had an impact on H&R Block e-filers. At this point, it is no longer an IRS problem, it's an H&R Block problem so why don't they just own up to it. I wonder if I can file a complaint with the Attorney General to receive the nearly $300 I paid them to file a return. I had already completed in order to receive my refund quicker because I feel that I've been mislead and am a victim of theft by deception. read more hide
Went to H&R Block to do my tax return on 2/3/2012. I opted for the Emerald card because it was free and I could expect my money in a much faster time window than the direct deposit. I would divulge more details, but as you can see below me, no one is happy with this business anymore. I will not be using this company any more. I was told I would receive my money by the 15th, but still, there's not a single penny on that card. read more hide
They told me my refund would be in my bank on the 15th. Well, it's not. I think they just want the interest on this money. They can stick it where the sun doesn’t shine. I will never use them again, 40 years of business shot to hell. read more hide
I filed my taxes on the 1st of Feb. and have not received no refund yet. I called H&R Block this morning and was told to give it 24 hrs for it to finish getting processed. I hope they're not giving me the run around again.
I filed my taxes on 1-31-2012 electronically, I was told they would go on my emerald card on 2-8-2012 but I never received them. Then I was told I would get them today 2-15-2012 by h and r block. Well, still nothing. I paid almost $300.00 to get them back in a timely manner. I called h and r and I get the run around, same thing with the IRS. I have done business with h and r for 30 years but never again, poor customer service, poor business. I feel a lot of people have been wronged by them, enough is enough.
I got my taxes done at H and R Block. They did not give me any of the deductions I should get. They said I would get $135 back from the Federal Government, and owed the state $2,900. I had someone else do my taxes. I will get $4,000 the Federal Government, and owed the state $2,000. That is a big difference. I will never be back. I think you should pay me the $276 I paid.
I am completely outraged at not only the overcharging of the tax preparations done in their office, but now to find out that they tell their customers that there will be a delay in their refunds and it will not be 7-14 days as promised due to the IRS. However, everyone I know who hasn't done their taxes through H&R Block has received their loans with no delay at all! After all of the charges for what they promise is due to a faster, even "fastest" refund possible is a lie! I want a refund for these outrageous fees and for them not being upfront. If a company cannot live up to their promise, when we are ultimately paying for them to do so, then they do not deserve for me or anyone else to pay for something that is false. I am outraged to say the least!
I have used H&R Block for the past 20 years. The past 2 years have been the same, delay of refund. I went to H&R Block and filed my taxes on Feb 3, 2012. I was told my tax refund would be put on an Emerald bank card on the 15th of Feb. I expressed my concerns because of the past year (2010) with direct deposit. The direct deposit came a week latter then they had stated, blaming the IRS. Of course, they did not tell me of any delay until the day the refund was to be in my bank account. Again a delay, this year I am in the same boat. The day the refund was to be put on a bank card. No refund. It is the IRS fault again. Of course, they knew a head of time there was a delay and did not let me know. Now they are telling me possible Feb 22. This is so wrong. I told them I need the money and they assured me it would be there on Feb 15. I will not use them again. I feel ripped off again. Live and learn. They have no interest in keeping long term customers.
I e-filed with H & R Block on January 23rd. I still have not received my refund. I was told by corporate H & R Block "that once it is out of our hands, there is nothing we can do". I am furious. Friends filed using Turbo Tax and received their refund in 2 weeks! I have been a customer for 20 some years. What a shame. I will never use H & R Block again!
Filled February 1st and I was told that the latest I would get my tax return would be on February 13. It cost me $120.00 exactly and the year before, it cost me $115.00. These prices were with me paying that day in cash or check. Way to expensive! I'm going to have to go back to an independent person or TurboTax. H&R Block is just too darnn expensive. To top things off, I can't say I remember ever getting my tax return by the date they have ever quoted me. I was told this time by the latest, February 13, I could expect my return... it's February 14 and it's not in my bank account. Way too expensive for my pocket book!
We have used H&R Block for 18 years, but this will be the last year we will use their services. I filed on January 30th and was strongly suggested to receive our loan via Emerald Card within 7-14 days, but given February 8th as my refund date from H&R Block. It is 16 days later and still no refund. While I understand the IRS has run behind this year, H&R Block has knowingly used terms like Rapid Refund lingo to lure and mislead customers by offering a service that they can no longer provide.
I went in today to file a couple simple W-2's, 1099-R and a 1098-E. The lady charged me 182.00! I feel so stupid for letting this place charge me that much to file simple taxes. My refund was only about $600.00 and now it’s only $400.00. These greedy ** people! "Oh were here to help our clients, we want the best service for our clients!" is what they say! Bull crap! Then I tried to opt-out and they said they could do nothing for me. I tried TurboTax and it would have only cost me $66.00 to do my taxes this year. I hope people listen to this and not have to learn the hard way like me. I really could have used that money they charged me. H&R Block is a major rip off!
I went to H&R Block on January 20, 2012 and filled my taxes. I was told I could pick up my check on February 1. Well, needless to say due to all the mess on the news about filing early when I didn’t receive a call that day figured I was going to have to wait another week. February 8 and I still had not got a call so I called H&R Block. I was told it was not there. I called on February 9 and it was not there. February 10 I called and said it had been 21 days since I had filed. Could someone tell me what is going on? I was told to hold on, then she came back on the phone and told me my check was there. I went to pick up my check and the same girl I spoke with on the phone told me it was not there. Needless to say, after they searched and whatever she told me she did not know who I spoke with but the check was not there. I was not happy as they could see. In about 10 minutes another lady came to me and said that my check was showing up in their system but was not there. So they would have to contact the IRS and see what had happened to the check. I was to call back in a couple of days. Today is 3 days later, February 13. I called today and there’s no check and no info on what was going on with my check. The lady that was supposed to contact to IRS is off today. The longer I thought about it the madder I got. I called back this evening and asked for a number for the IRS. Now I am told that the check did not print out. There are 16 checks that did not print out. The IRS has sent my money yet H&R Block’s printer did not print it. So here I sit waiting on someone in that office to contact the IRS or whoever. They can't tell me a number yet they are contacting someone to issue me a check who knows when or who. H&R Block has charged me hundreds of dollars to do my taxes. I think for their printer problem and my run around and around I should have a refund from them. Like free do to their problem. I have never had a problem with them and they have done my taxes for 20 years. I won't be letting them do my taxes again. I feel like they don't want to take responsibility for their fault in this mess.
Anyone who is complaining that H&R Block is the cause of the funding delay is just ignorant. It has been reported on every news site on the web and also on the IRS website. Pull your heads out.
It's called theft by deception. Anyone who reads this, please call your local H&R Block and remind them that there is a law against what they are doing. Have your paper work in order, and print (or record) H&R Block's "promises" along with what the IRS website is telling you; keep good records. I called today and they told me they couldn’t help what the IRS does, so they aren't going to do anything about the money they've stolen. My girlfriend is a sales representative. She's not the company she works for. She gets a small percentage of her sales. Just this week she paid money out of her own pocket to make right what the company did wrong. Do you know why she did it? She did it because it was the right thing to do! Now she'll keep that customer for the long haul. I hate to say it, but H&R Block probably won't be as lucky as she is. Because of her honest heart, she gave money she didn't even have to keep just one customer. Because of H&R Block’s corporate greed, well I guess I’ll be going to the guy my girlfriend's family went to. They paid $70 to get theirs done the "long wait" way. They all got theirs within 2 weeks.
I filed my taxes on January 30, 2012. I was promised it would be available on Feb. 8. My daughter did her taxes after me online. She got hers on Feb. 5. Her friend did hers a few days ago online and has received hers today. So where is everyone’s money that has gone through H&R Block this year? My daughter paid nothing to file and she has her money. I paid $106 and have nothing. When you call H&R, they give you the run around, blaming the IRS. Well, H&R Block isn’t getting my business again, my daughter says so! I have been going there since my kids were little. What is up with you guys?
We filed our taxes on January 31, 2012. We, too, were told that the refund would be on the card by February 8, 2012. I bypassed the direct deposit option to avoid the outrageous fees. This is the first year we've opted for the Emerald Card (never again!). I filed my children's taxes on Turbo Tax the night before and they've received their refunds. I've gone to the same H&R Block office for over 10 years. This is the first time I've experienced this level of deception, lack of customer service, and no effort to even attempt to offer guidance or answers. I do understand it may be out of their control, but do not tell customers a date if you have no way to guarantee or know if it’s accurate. We now are waiting until February 21, 2012 as far as we know!
We filed our taxes on January 30, 2012 and were told it would be on our Emerald Card on February 8, 20112. Nothing yet and it is February 10, 2012. We called H&R Block, they referred us to IRS. At first the IRS said 7 to 14 days, now they are saying 10 to 21 days. What is up? I have bills to pay. Supposedly, if it was free for the month of January to get my refund put on the Emerald Card. I can see why! H&R Block ought to be liable for something considering they're telling everyone when to expect their refund and it isn't there.
I too filed with H&R on the evening of 1/31/12 and was quite happy to find out that I would get my refund on 2/8/12, and here it is the evening of the 9th and no money on card yet. ** me running.
I have used H&R Block for the past 3 years, just so I can get my money faster, and not have to wait for "Uncle Sam" to send it. This year, I did not receive my W2, until 1/31/12, and I went to H&R Block that evening to file. I was told that I would receive my "anticipation loan", on or around 2/8/12 via the Emerald Card. Of course, today is 2/9/12, and I still have not received anything. I called them yesterday to simply ask, if they knew when I should expect my refund. The lady was extremely polite and told me I should receive my funds by the end of the business day. 2/9/12 rolls around and still no money. Again, I called, but this time the IRS hotline number that I was given told me I would receive my money around 2/21/12, and that they were experiencing delays. I called H&R Block again to ask them if this was the correct date, since I was receiving an anticipation loan from them, and the lady got defensive and said that if that's the date the IRS gave me, then that's when it's coming. I am furious at H&R Block for charging me $300. I even told the second lady on the phone that I only went to them, and paid them so much, so I could get it faster, and she said they don't do refunds! I found on their website today that they posted there was a delay on 1/26/12, and I was not notified when I filed on 1/31/12, that there would be such a delay, and the only reason I paid them so much, was so I could get it faster. Never ever will I go back to H&R Block. Shame on me for not paying closer attention, and shame on them for dishonesty.
I filed my taxes on the morning of January 31st, 2012 with the HR Block on Silas Creek Pkwy. in Winston Salem, NC. I was going to file myself this year but HR Block was offering free RAC in 7 days, so I paid them to do my very simple taxes. I was promised my money on the 8th and I called customer service for the emerald card twice on the 8th. Both times they assured me the money would be in my account that day and that they had until midnight to do so. Well, here it is the 9th and I called customer service which is located in another country. They are very rude to me and they told me I have to call the IRS. I called the IRS and some guy named Mr. Islam from India (this is no lie, really) answered and told me that I would have to call HR Block. My power gets turned off tomorrow. I am a full time college student and I depend on my refunds and school money to live. Right now I have no food, my utilities are getting turned off, people are beating down my door to college money owed, and I am getting nothing from HR Block. I will never return to them again and I suggest you do the same.
I have gone to the same H&R Block for the last 3 years. The same lady has done my return. I filed on the 20th of January. I was shocked to see a direct deposit fee. She told me the Emerald Card was the best way to go. I was told I would get it around the 1st. Then on the 1st I received an email stating that the IRS was behind. I should see it on the 7th. The 7th has come and gone. Now no one seems to know anything! H&R Block is not living up to what they promised me. Very upset.
Like everybody else here, I too, was bamboozled by H & r Block. I was told 2-8-12 only to find out now it's more like 2-22-12. Needless to say, my bills are not going to go away till then and to now find out this has been going on since the IRS went online. And, they knew all about it and decided not to disclose that to people who are expecting the money they are promised on the day it was promised. It is a bunch of **. I just wish I would have done some research before filing. I just never had a prob the last 10 years I've used them. Never again!
I went to H & R, on 1/31/12. I was given a statement that I would receive my refund on 2/8/12, today, and there was no money! I had obligations which I was supposed to fulfill today, and to a single mother of two toddlers, who unexpectedly lost her job recently, such a thing is a true hardship. I watched countless ads on the TV where they promised to get you your loan in 7-14 days. This is the sole reason why instead of going to my tax preparer of 4 years, I went to H & R where not only did it cost me $297 to file my taxes (it's usually $200 tops), but I now have no idea when I will be able to get some financial relief. Shame on H & R Block and I will be telling everyone I know not to go with H & R Block again!
I filed my taxes on the first of February because I didn't receive my w2 til that day. I was a walk in which I knew others had appointments so I didn't expect to be the first one called. I waited the normal approximate time that you should when you are a walk in. So, as soon as I went back, there my tax preparer didn't want to file my taxes like I wanted to. I wanted to file head of household but yet he insisted I filed single. After that, the rest went well, I wanted to get mine back on an emerald card so I didn't have to pay the ridiculous fee for the direct deposit. As soon as it was over, I was told that I would receive my return on the 8th of February which it is and do I have them, so I called and they said I wouldn't receive them until the 22nd. My sister-in-law did hers through turbo tax and got hers back in four days. I'm done going through H and R Block. They will never get a dime of my money again!
First, we had an appointment at 5 o'clock. When the tax preparer came out, he saw a friend who did not have an appointment (friend stated that). He went back in and came out and took her back. There was another client whose appointment was 5 o'clock also. Why do we make appointments when they are not kept for appointed times? About 30 minutes later, a gentleman comes out and goes to take the 5 o'clock person who came after us. She spoke and told the gentleman we were there before her (very considerate and we appreciated what she did). The gentleman just said I don't know and went back in and came out with our name. Our taxes were simple with no deductions for household improvements and simple to file. We came back because last year we were treated very good and given information to do for the next year filing. In our 2010 taxes, we had a lot of deductions like first homeowners, new car, etc. I understood that year's fee was reasonable. But this years with nothing extra, I was charged $238.75. Can someone please estimate how you can charge this amount for basic filing? Please let me know why it was such a high price.
I paid for an RAC from H and R Block to guarantee that my general tax refund would be direct deposited to my H and R Block emerald card account in seven days. After doing some research, I discovered on the IRS website that my refund would be delivered in 7 days, regardless of what I paid H and R Block. I feel I was wrongfully led into an agreement, to pay money for services that were free. H and R Block scammed me, and I'm sure I'm not the only one.
First, we've done our taxes on 1/24/12 and they said we made it to the cutoff date to get our check on the 1st of Feb 2012. It didn't come that day, so my husband called the next day and asked what was going on. They said we wouldn't get out the check until the 7th of Feb 2012! Then today at 10:34AM, 2/6/12, they called me and my husband and said our check was in so we were happy, got ready and went and tried to pick the check to find out that it was my husband's dad's check because he is a Senior and my husband is a Junior! Any how, we filed ours way before his dad did and he got his today plus when I looked at the H&R Block website and put SS in and date of birth, it said the check would be in 7-14 days. Okay, first off, today is the 14th day and they said we won't get our check until Wednesday, 2/8/12. That will be 16 days. I am so upset I want something to be done to H&R Block. I will never ever go back to them again. We have been loyal clients for a couple of years now. Well, they lost ours. They are a joke and cost was too much to do it!
I filed my taxes on January 20th, 2012. I was told that by using the Emerald Card I would get it back by February 1st, 2012. I then was sent an email saying that the IRS is behind and that I would receive my refund by February 7th, 2012. Now I am being told that it will be more than likely be Direct Deposited on February 8th, 2012, and that it will take H&R Block approximately 72 hours to remove their fees and put the money on the card. Not one person had told me that they hold the money for up to 72 hours to remove their fees before it goes on the card. Also, I paid almost $300 to get my taxes done, and now I can't even call on the Emerald Card to find anything out as my name is not on the account, only my husband’s! We filed jointly, why am I not on the account? This is all very frustrating and I have been filing my taxes with H&R for over 15 years and I will never file with them again. The hidden fees when you use the card were also never told us. They push it saying you can pull money off, but beware, it will cost you!
Why are we paying H&R Block $250 to $300 to just end up waiting and waiting and waiting to see our tax refund? I do not buy that it's caused from an IRS backlog! My daughter-in-law used Turbo Tax, (for free) and received a refund in 5 days. My H&R block was filed 7 days ago (electronic) and I still haven't seen a dime! I have used H&R Block for like 20 years, but not sure I'll use them again next year.
I went into H&B Block on Hamilton Blvd in Sioux City Iowa on January 27, 2012. I have been a customer of H&R Block for 10 years. I have had the same preparer for the last 5 or 6 years. She is great. Well I needed to have my taxes done quick and she was booked for days so I made an appointment at the closest office as I need my money for a new car for my 3 children and 1 on the way. I am extremely on a high risk pregnancy and have to go the doctor all the way across town every week. Well I went in with all the proper documentation and he completely disregarded it. I had my 1098 from my school and the receipts for my books and he didn't even use them. He said it did not need to be filed or make a difference. I have never been told this before and on top of it, he told me false information about allocated tips and charged me extra. I paid over $350.00 for my taxes to be filed and he took over 2 hours to do my taxes. I have never spent more than 45 minutes to an hour getting them done. I will never ever return to H&R Block. On top of that, I have it that I am supposed to receive my money on my Emerald Card on the 8th and the IRS says the 15th of February. H&R Block is a bunch of deceivers and I fully intend to hire a lawyer and sue for all this.
H&R Block is surely in trouble. After reading the many complaints issued for its promise to load emerald cards within 8-14 days, the IRS and other government agencies should be looking into the deceitful ways of H&R Block. Due to its deceptive practice, a civil lawsuit by all those who were led astray should be filed, as folks were made a promise. Those fooled by the company paid the amount and they are facing even greater financial challenges as a result of this false promise. Anticipation loans with cards loaded within 8-14 days, H&R Block will face much in failure for lying to the consumer who paid them money to receive the money that they are rightfully due.
We paid a lot of extra money for a RAC on purpose and for most of us, it has taken almost 3-4 weeks instead of 7-10 days as H&R Block promise. This is why we chose that option instead of just going to irs.gov and filing our returns. This is why we are angry. Anticipation means before the IRS issues our refunds, we will get what they estimated. H&R Block is supposed to be our liaison to the IRS and the middleman should take the fall when they agree to it, which they did. The minute they offer anticipation checks or loans, they agree to let us pay a high fee to receive our money before the IRS would get it to us. We would have gone through irs.gov and gotten free returns done for the same amount of time and gotten more of our own money back money. H&R Block should accept responsibility for this because they have a contract to us as clients. A promise of an RAC is proof of that and we deserve our money back. If we are not getting anticipated refunds then we should only have to pay for the preparer to do our return, not extra for an RAC. That isn't really an RAC.
I filed my taxes on 1-23-12. I have been going to H&R Block for a bout 5 years now with the same guy. He is so nice and friendly, but he lied to me this year. He said I should get the Emerald card, that it's faster than getting it deposited to my checking account, and this is not true at all. The IRS is not backed up. My friend did hers on the 25th and she received hers in her account o today 2-3-12, so I feel that H&R doesn't care to have returning customers and they can smile to your face and lie to you. I am very sadden that this happened, not all for the delay but also for a person that prepared my taxes who would always say hi when we saw one another out in public. He was like a family friend. So cheated. But at least next year I will know better.
I used H&R block for the fifth year, and it was a mistake. The IRS Where is Refund site says my refund was deposited on the 31st of January. However, H&R Block says they have not received anything from the IRS. H&R Block replied to my inquiry, with a message saying that paying my filing fees by using my tax refund, would delay my refund by 4 days. It would have been very helpful if I had this information, when I filed my taxes. Nowhere in the process did it say choosing this option, will cause a delay in your refund. I have never had to wait, until after the direct deposit date given by the IRS to get my refund. Sadly, I am strongly counting on this refund to live off this semester. I am a completely independent college student studying abroad. I have not gotten my school books, and it's the fourth week of school. I haven't eaten in two days. I budgeted and rationed until my anticipated refund date.
Okay, for all of you, especially the military, H&R Block has no pull over when you get your refund. The IRS is backed up, and having problems. This does not fall on H&R Block, so why are you bashing them? Other tax places are having the same problems. I am pissed off at customers, cause they want their money right then! It's the IRS, and as for military customers that are complaining, I'm in military as well, and we are full aware of the hard times for everyone in this country. We live pay check to pay check, even though if it wasn't for my husband and other military members, then this country we call so great, might not even exist anymore. Just because we can't get our money right away, it doesn't mean it's H&R Block's fault, because it's not! I cannot repeat that enough! If you want to complain, then complain to the IRS, and post this ** as a consumer report for them. Everyone knows that tax companies charge a lot to do your taxes. That shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone. That's just how it is. Yes, I was supposed to get my refund on the 1st, then the IRS said by the 7th, and heck if I know if I will actually get it by then, but it's not H&R Block's fault. Hopefully, all of you will receive it sooner than later, but until then, go complain about the IRS because you won't get your money back, by complaining about who did your taxes, when they did their job like they were supposed to do. That's all. All of these posts are just ticking me off, because you should know better.
Why in the world did I pay about $300.00 on Jan. 19th for my check to be here by the 1st and now I have to wait till the 7th? Where does the $300.00 go? I feel I deserve something back. This really isn’t fair at all. Isn’t stealing a crime?
I filed my taxes on Jan. 14th. I was told the money would be there by Jan. 24 here it is Feb. 2nd and nothing. If I call all I get is you should get it by Feb. 7th and they do not know anything else. I've been using HR Block for years now and I will not do so again. I don't care if I have to drive the 2 hours to a different company. All HR Block does is lie to its customers. If you call, they do not answer your questions or give you the run around. So I'm out $300. That is the last they will ever get from me.
I too, fell prey to the "get your money by Feb. 1st", emerald card scam. I needed money back quickly to pay debts, and now were being told no money for at least 3 weeks. What did I pay the extra money for then? And to be told it's a government issue is a lie, isn't it called a loan anticipation loan, meaning we are getting a loan, based on our anticipated refund? That's clearly what the paperwork states, and that loan is from a secondary lender, nothing to do with the government. I think it's pretty clear they did false advertising, as well as flat lied to customers in a scam to subtract more money from their clients. I have had my taxes done by H&R Block for 10 years, but there wont be an eleventh. Not only should we now get our refunds, but also interest due, per day late, until they give us our money. It's not theirs.
My husband and I filed our taxes with H&R Block and took the refund anticipation check to. We were misled by the person who made us believe not only would we get it back faster but cheaper. They said a bank check was $20.00 and direct deposit to our account was almost $40. They told us we would be given a check by the 8th of Feb. and when I did my refund through the irs.gov it said it's scheduled to be direct deposited on the 6th of Feb. So how can they charge me interest on a loan for a faster refund when really all they are doing is writing a check for my refund just deposited into their bank account? Why are they not legally responsible for disclosing this information? I do think H&R Block preys on poor people who need their refund fast.
I went to H&R Block on January 7, 2012, e-filed and had the refund put on the Emerald card so we could have the refund in 7-14 days. The e-file was put through on January 17. When the IRS went online. I received an email on January 19 saying the taxes were accepted and to expect the refund on January 25. That day came but no refund. I called H&R Block, they said it was pushed back to February because the IRS was behind. That day has also come and gone with no refund. I could have e-filed for free but instead I paid $349.00 for nothing. Never again!
H and R Block San Antonio: It seems that my wife and I are not the only ones that H and R Block lied to. We filed here in San Antonio Texas at the West ave location and told we would get the refund on February 1st. After we check the irs.gov web site, it looks as though it will take three weeks to receive it. H and R b lock is afraid to lose any business so they are simply blaming the IRS for the delays and not admitting any knowledge. They also still have their Loan Anticipation posters on the wall. If you have not filed yet. Please avoid H and R Block. Thank you.
My disgust is for the exact same reasons that every person has stated about H&R Block. I was also told that if I used the Emerald Card to receive my refund, that I would receive it by February 1, 2011. We specifically told our preparer that we had a local bank (Navy Federal Credit Union), and that the IRS could send the money directly to our account. We stated to the preparer, and we were very clear, that we were in need of an advance (rapid) refund, and that if they did not offer that service, we would file elsewhere. The tax preparer on Fort Bragg (name withheld), blatantly told us that we were getting the Emerald Card for that exact purpose and we would receive our taxes so much sooner than if we waited for the IRS to send our return to our bank account. We were point blank lied to by H&R Block. They have purposely deceived their clients by using the word "advance" in their Rapid Advance Check. There is no such thing with this company. They at no time had any intention of advancing any money to their clients. Instead, they have charged their clients, and defrauded them in the process. We are a military family and have fallen on very hard times, as every other American family has, due to the economic hardships this past year. I am prepared to file suit against H&R Block and I welcome everyone and anyone to join me. I certainly pray that an attorney will contact me that wish to pursue this matter. I will personally make sure that our Base Commander receives word of this issue. Every soldier, and family, that walks through those doors of H&R Block (and they have set up multiple) mobile sites on Fort Bragg, is being misled and, as we all have been, lied to directly to our faces. We need help!
I did my taxes with H and R Block for the last 6 years and this year I got a notice in the mail saying I was eligible for the refund anticipation check since I did my taxes with them last year. Well, I was under the impression that the refund anticipation check was like there old rapid refund but came to find out that all a refund anticipation check means is that you have your taxes direct deposited on a emerald card. If I would have known that, I would have just used my own bank account. Hello, I feel tricked then I get charged $252. I will not be going back next year that’s for sure.
In the past, I've always used H&R Block to file my taxes and as a single-parent, I appreciated the ability to receive my refund early via their RAL services. However, I will never again use them to process my tax return. Yes, there are issues with the new IRS system, but that doesn't prevent HRB from fully disclosing they no longer offer RAL as a service until after your return has been completed and for continuing to market timelines for returns that they know are inaccurate. I was not told by my preparer that RALs were no longer offered until we began discussing return options and only then was it mentioned because I inquired when he failed to list it as an option. In addition, HRB continues to use the RAL/RAC language, even though they know the terms have refund terms have changed and it's misleading to customers. Their marketing this year was purposefully misleading and predatory. They intentionally allowed customers to believe their practices were the same as with previous years, and opted out of disclosing critical changes until prompted by the customer. I will never use their services again or make another referral. At best this practice has been unethical and should be considered unlawful.
H&R block is to be blamed for this issue. For all of you saying that the IRS is responsible. The H&R block anticipation loans are paid for by an outside lender, the money does not come from the IRS. If there is anything backed up, it is H&R block, and whatever banking company they are working with. The IRS constantly has problems with being backed up, and it has never stopped me or anyone I know from getting their anticipation loan on time before. When my husband and I filed our taxes, I still had not received the necessary documents from my school to file. We were told multiple times by our tax preparer that we could go back, when I received those papers and add it in to be deposited onto our emerald card, and whats more? He said it wouldn't cost a penny. A week later, I printed out my tax forms for school, and made an appointment with the same guy. Then, we find out that he was very dishonest the first time around. Not only would we have to send in the tax forms by mail, which will take us about three months to receive that chunk of our return, but we also had to pay more than $30 to file it. We have gone to H&R block for three years now, and we will not go again.
My daughter lives in Florida, and had her taxes done for free. My son is in Texas and he had to pay $70 for his taxes, the same thing they told me at H&R Block that it was only participating H&R Blocks that offer the free deal but not if you look on the website. It is false advertisement. He wants his money back . It's pretty good money an hour they make, the thieves.
My family went to H&R Block. We have in writing that we will receive our RCA on or around the first of Feb 2012 and I am sure that other customers signed the same agreement. H&R Block bank needs to honor their agreement. This is what the whole issue is about not what the IRS is up to or behind we sign an agreement with H&R Block bank! I will not go back to H&R Block again. We paid extra to get our checks and it would have been just as fast to let the IRS send it. That isn't how this was supposed to work out as anyone else would agree.
I understand that the IRS is backed up and everyone’s anticipation loans are set back. But when I called my tax preparer, she told me that every year there is always some kind of issue with the IRS in regards to people getting their money on a specific date. So, if H and R Block knows that the date they give you to get your money is not guaranteed due to problems with the IRS, how in the world can they charge you such extreme rates?! They are thieves.
I was not told upfront that they would charge $300 for filing an EIC. Had I known this, I would have used Turbo Tax again and saved $270. I was told by the lady who filed that it was a standard filing. I was told the charges, after I was locked in with them. I'm not happy. I really hate these companies that prey on people in these hard economic times. I am a single mother of 3 children and feel like they took from my children.
I paid nearly $300.00 for a 7-10 day refund, and now they claim there is no fast refund. They knew this when we filed on the 24th of January 2012, and decided not to tell us, and still charged us for a quick refund. They knew anyone filing before January 26, 2012, were going to be delayed an extra week, on top of the 7-10 days they promised, and charge you for. How can it be legal for them to do this, when they knew bout people filing before the 26th had to wait an extra week on top of the 7-10 days?
I went to the tax office in Spokane, W.A. I received mail saying I could file a simple tax return for free with H & R Block and also went in and showed the first lady the mail. She said, "Yes, we will do your taxes free today." They even have a commercial saying they will do your simple tax return free till February. Well, I was unhappy to come back for a second time that week to finish filing but it took an hour and a half for them to file my return. I sat down with this lady and I guess she started it, got part of my info and then she became too busy on the phone and her next appointment came in. So she passed me on to another lady. The new lady was nice but come to find out the girl that started my return wasn't there at that time that day so they had to bypass things with her employee code so they could finish my return. Then after all of that, I was charged a fee of $338.75 for them do it. I went in after work and I was tired from working at 5 am till 2 pm. They said if the return was finished by the first lady the other day, you wouldn't be here this long. I didn't cause a scene but felt like ** after that, then was ** because for something that was supposed to be done free, it cost $338.75. What was supposed to be done in one sitting and with one person took 3 people and two sittings. I just wanted them to finish so I could go home. After settling down, I called the customer service number to ask why they would advertise that they would do a simple return for free and told them what had happened that day when I went in the second time and all the girl could say was,"I'm sorry for that. We took off a small fee of $38 that was for the emerald card fees" but I already had a card. I have been going there for 5 years and I don't think I will go back next year. There's too much flip flopping and I hope my return was filed correctly. I know I had the right to just say stop and walk out but if you get the refund loan they offer in December, you're locked into filing with them that tax year but next year it's not worth it to go through the **. Sorry, H&R Block. You have lost my business.
I filed my taxes on Jan. 17th, 2012. I was told I would receive my refund by Jan. 25th, 2012. Today is the 30th of Jan. and still there is no refund. I paid extra money just to receive my refund back quicker and instead, it comes late. I have been a customer with H & R Block for the past 12 years. This is the last year I will ever use them again.
After 14 years going to HR Block, I was told I would get my refund on the 27th. Now I am being told the 1st of February. I paid $300 to have my return done and not even a half refund. This is a total scam & rip off. I will not be returning to this rip off company with this kind of customer service! I'm reporting to the BBB for misleading me to get my money! Beware. H&R Block is ripping people off and needs to be sued!
I filed my taxes on the 10th of January. I was told I would receive my refund on the 25th. I was charged $275.75 for 20 minutes it took so I would get my money back in 7 to 14 days. I was told it takes H&R block Bank six days to load it on to the Emerald card. This is totally unfair to us considering there's more fees to send it anywhere else. I told them I was totally unhappy and I would like a refund I was told that's not possible. H&R block is very deceiving and once you fill with them you're locked in so beware!
Hate to burst your bubbles like this people, but the IRS itself is backed up. I did not file with H&R Block for the first time in 12 years this year, and my refund was supposed to be the 25th. Now the IRS is saying Feb 1st, and over the phone they’re saying it could be Feb 15th. So before you post bad things about a company, that is overall a good company, please check the facts out first. TurboTax, Jackson Hewitt and others have told my co-workers the same thing also.
I use H&R Block every year and I love the service. I see people on here complaining about not getting their check return on time and worrying about not getting it on the 25th. Well, guess what you can go to liberty . Jackson Hewitt and it would be no different, it's not a tax preparer issue or a company franchise issue, its the IRS . They decided they got better tools to use and by doing so, some people get the taxes back a little later. It wasn't till today, that tax preparers found out that people that get their taxes done on or before the 17th, would have to wait till January up to February 7. Anyone doing their taxes now with refund anticipation, gets their return in 7-14 days. And, as of this year, there is no rapid anticipation loan. IRS is banning it, so next year there won't be such a thing for any kind of loan. You could have gotten the emerald advance and got some of your money same day but that was a limited time offer. You get to check on your refund check www.irs.gov or look up the number. And for the people that haven't gotten their W2's yet, legally, they have to be in by the 31st of January. But you can go to hrblock.com/w2 and click on w2, early access to have them sent to hr-block (pw is your full birthday 8 characters), and as for the emails going around if you get any calls from H&R Block, saying that need your info fast (banking info). It's a scam. Immediately call an H&R Block office and alert them immediately.
We had our taxes filled out on January 12th at H&R Block and we were told that it would be on January 17th before the IRS was accepting them, and we should get our return by the 24th of January. It is now January 27th and when I called, I am told that there is a delay due to all the tax returns being processed at this time. Another H&R block employee tells me that for some reason anyone who filed their taxes before the 17th of January will not receive them on their emerald card until February 7th. Friends who had their taxes prepared January 17th already have received their returns which were deposited directly in their bank accounts. This is the last time for H&R Block for us!
For those of you that are having problems with getting their refunds: you need to do your research and stop blaming the tax company when it's the IRS.
I filed my taxes on the 17th of January, and I was told by the agent that I will receive it on the 25th, so I made plans to have people come out and make repairs on my place, expecting to get my money. That day, I didn't get anything. As a matter a fact, I found that my account was overdrawn for some $1.00 and $2.00 fees. There were like 4 of them. It's now the 27th, and I checked my email, and I read the email, and they said the 2nd of Feb., and then I did the "where's my refund" online, and it said that it won't be there until the 7th of Feb. I paid my taxes, and I worked for every dollar that I have made, and I want my money. I don't care what kind of problems the state has with mismanaging our money, but then again, we are too busy helping other countries, and neglect our country all the time. I don't see other countries coming to our aid, when we have natural disasters. However, we send our American hard earned money to them and our help, and what do we get? Debt and hate. I want my money, and I am sure thousands of others want theirs as well.
I was told I would receive my refund on January 25. It is now January 27, and still no refund. I was told by H&R Block that the IRS was backed up, and I wouldn't receive my refund until Feb 1st, but when I called the IRS, they said I will receive it before January 31st. My refund should come to my Emerald card, which I didn't want, but I was told that if i wanted to get my refund direct deposited into my account, then it would cost an extra $50, so i decided to go with the Emerald card. Just yesterday, my tax preparer texted me, telling me there's a scam going on with these Emerald cards, and not to give my Emerald card info to anyone. This is my first time filing with H&R Block, and will never happen again, to never experience something like this. I should have known, especially since my sister had problems with them last year.
I was told I would get my refund check by the 25th of January. Today is the 27th, and I still haven't gotten word from them. You can't tell people one thing, then do another. This is my first and last year with H&R block. I am filing a complaint with BBB as well.
I was told that I was getting my refund on the 25 of January. It has been two days and still no refund. Looked on the IRS website and it said Jan 31, which on is it. Called H&R Block and they couldn't even tell me when my refund is going to be here. First year doing it with the company and I would never ever come back after this.
I was unhappy because I didn't feel like our tax work wasn't worth $248.00. We are a senior citizen and it took our last $248.00. I felt like it was just a ez paper work. I will not use H & R Block again and will not recommend anyone to them. Thank you for your cooperation.
I have filed my taxes with H&R Block over ten years. In the past, I was got the rapid refund option and paid the high fees to do so. Now that they don’t offer this option anymore, we are told we will get refund in 7-14 days but I was charged about $323 for H&R Block fees and peace of mind. After reading these complaints, I too am wondering why are their fees are still so high for less service, meaning no rapid refund. It’s now been 13 days since I filed this is the longest wait time. I’ve had to wait from H&R Block or IRS to issue the refund to me. I might as well have filed an e-file myself. My taxes are so simple, head of household with 3 dependents. Why am I paying H&R Block high fees for fewer outcomes than before? From looks of it, I’m reading that Jackson Hewitt offers faster refunds. That’s a thought.
I was told that my refund would be on my Imperial card on January 25, 2012. But now I am being told that I won’t get my refund until Jan 31, 2012. I paid them 200.00 dollars to have by the 25th. But now they say there were too many refunds to do and they don’t give refunds for the huge amount. I pad to insure I would get my money by the 25th. After this year, I will no longer use your company and I will make sure I tell everyone I come in contact with that your company cannot be trusted.
I was told I was going to receive my refund back on a certain day and never received it, and when I went in to see why I haven't received any money yet. They had really no explanation and had really no idea when I was going to receive it, yet I paid them extra money to get it back early.
When I filed my 2010 taxes, my H and R Block rep. found a mistake, made by the former rep, who was no longer with the company. The mistake was for 2008 and 2009. I was told that I could wait until I am contacted by the IRS, but decided to go ahead and pay what I owed. I received a statement from IRS, informing me of the interest owed. I sent the money owed, and sent the interest statement to my H and R Block rep, in May of 2011. It is now the end of January 2012, and I have not received a refund. My H and R Block rep has sent info, called, sent fax pages. She has been great. Still, I have not received my money. I saved them a lot of money, by going ahead and paying what I owed. This is no way to do business, and keep your clients. My next step seems to be the TV show "2 on your side", which may be my only recourse.
Apparently, there are issues concerning late fee with the IRS for $1755 and are you not supposed to pay these late fees.
I have been filing with H&R Block for the pass ten years. Almost every time I take out a holiday loan, for some reason this year, they denied me. This brought so much this disappointment because I am a loyal customer. I have also brought them business. I have tried contacting them several times.
It took 3 years for my deceased husband's IRA to be rolled into mine. On October 14, 2011, I asked for my IRA to be sent to me in it's entirety. I was told this would take 7-10 days and as of today, I have still not received a check. They have the worst customer service I have ever received anywhere. This check not coming is just the final straw. I truly don't know how they stay in business.
I got a $2,500 credit for going to school in 2009 because the agent asked when I graduated college and how much a semester's tuition was. What he failed to do was ask for the proper paperwork supporting this which is a 1098-T form. Therefore the government sends me a notice saying I owe the money back and when I go to school to get the 1098-T form, they told me that I was billed in 2008 for my 2009 schooling, so the tax credit will not apply for that year.
My name was listed in a class action lawsuit regarding H&R Block and fees in relations to preparing income tax refunds in 2005. I never received compensation from the settlement. If I was entitled to receive compensation, then I feel that I should have received it by now. My son passed away in 2005 and I went into a great depression and was unable to respond to any claim at that time.
I went into an H & R Block office and had my taxes prepared on Feb. 1, 2011. EZ form was used. No deductibles, no changes, same as every year (I have been a customer of theirs for 20 years now). Their ad said up to 8 to 15 days. So by Feb. 17th, I began to question. On the 18th, there was the refund put onto the emerald card that I was given on the day of my filing. Now the emerald advance had a due date of Feb. 15th, the day that the advance had to be paid back before the late charge was applied. On Feb. 18th, I received my refund. I have since received a letter from the IRS stating that the refund was delayed because a tax credit was not applied by H&R Block computer during their calculations that entitled me to $400 more in my refund. Letter received in March 2 (H&R Block oops). So on Feb.18, when I saw that there was too much money on my emerald card, I called # on card, and the payment service expert explained briefly that the IRS had given more money but that there was something wrong with their computers. My payment was not taken out of my refund and I needed to make a payment at that time of $561.34. Of course I did. I used my account # for emerald card. The gentleman promised that the computer would not make another payment when it was fixed, but later that day it did. (H&R Block oops) So I called back. Their response was, "well we'll give you a case # but they won't be able to work on it until Feb.22", after the holiday at which point it will take 7 to 10 business days to post it back into my account. It is now today, 10 business days later and my money is still not on my account. So I called them again. Their response today is that it was not posted into the card that I have, it was posted into a different card which occurred on Feb.21st (H&R Block oops yet again) and now it will take 24 to 48 hrs for a card transfer. Absolutely it is my responsibility to repay a loan on time. It is my responsibility to pay any interest rates on that loan for untimely payments. But my issue is that the emerald advance is designed to give advances on a persons income taxes refund. It is also designed to be repaid by refund. So how many people's return was delayed by their computers mistake, causing all of us to have to pay an interest charge. It would have received my refund on time, therefore repaying on time if it hadn't been for their mistake to begin with. I understand that because they didn't offer rapid refund this year that they lost business, but doing this shady thing does not seem fair. And how long can they hold my money before they have to start paying me interest? And now today, the person informed me that I would not be getting $561.34 credited back into my card, even though the rep on the morning of Feb. 18 said that what I owed was $561.34 and the automatic payment of $561.34 was deducted from my account as full payment on that day. The man today said that I would only receive $544.76. I am really tired of talking to them. Every day, it is a different story. Can, essentially, a banking institution behave in such dishonest way? I doubt there is anything that you can do to help me. This is what happens when a person gets mixed up with dishonest, untrained and unprofessional people. But I just wanted to let you know that if someone else was really wronged by them, the person complaining is right. Believe what ever is being said about H&R Block
Ive been going to HR for the past 6 years. We would always get RAL's in the past. We did them even knowing the outrageous fees that came with them ($400 for 1 day). We would get returns of 7500 - 8500 (3 kids mind you) in refund. At the time, I was still making under 24,000, so 400 didn't seem like a big deal. Well this year, HR loses its HSBC partner and can no longer do RAL's. I thought to myself, "OK, I'll wait for 8 days, and pay way less than I usually do". This was not the case! In the past, before we would file, we would get options on how fast to receive RAL (1 day, 5 days, a week, etc). The faster, the more pricier. Well I wanted to e-file this year, but I got a call from them wanting me to go in. I told them I was going to do them myself this year, but would check them out. After all, I've been going there for the past 6 years and felt it was only fair to do. Well, I got in and went through all the motions and behold! no RAL, but a 2-week return is going to cost almost $400! I told them that it makes no sense, with the pricing that they have always used in the past. I was told that I was charged "per form". So it was $341 to HR, another $35 for the bank, and some other fees packed away. Now these are fine and dandy if we were getting the money ASAP like in the past, but we're not! It just makes no sense! I might as well go to Jackson Hewitt and pay that amount and get my refund in less than 48 hrs! So after all this, me and my wife looked at each other and just agreed, no way! As it was going, the agent was already getting on my nerves, he just was not giving off a good vibe. I'm done with them and will not recommend anyone to them as the fees for a standard return cost as much as RAL's used to, and Jackson Hewitt charges just as much, but at least you get your refund ASAP. I suggest that you stay away unless you like paying for forms, bank fees, super high tax agent cost and waste time sitting on the chair!
Back in November of 2009, I went into H&R Block to obtain a loan. The agent informed me to bring in my last paycheck stub & that would determine how much you would receive on your next years tax return. According to the amount on my check stub, the agent informed me that I would be getting approx $4000 back on my tax return so that qualified me to get a loan of $1000. They explained that once I received my W2, come in to have my taxes done and they would take their $1000 off the top. When I received my W2 in February, I went in to apply and they informed me that I wasn't receiving money back from the IRS that I owed money. So, of course I was in shock because they had already told me I would be getting approx $4000. I asked about repaying the loan. I told them I didn't have $1000 right then to repay the loan. They told me to call customer service. I called and spoke to an agent who informed me to make payments. I was making $50 payments which I could afford. I called them in May and informed them that I was going to be on Medical Leave from work and would not be able to make my monthly payments for about 2 months being that I would be on disability and would not be receiving my full pay. I was told that it would be noted and to resume making my payments in August. They didn't inform me this would go to collections or anything. I checked my mailbox and learned they had forwarded this account to collections. I spoke to collections and told them I could pay $50 what I was paying H&R Block. I feel this was a scam and they were not truthful from the beginning. They led me to believe I was getting a certain amount and then told me no I wasn't.
Got the run around for the last 4 weeks trying to get my monies from Emerald Card. They lied to me and more things. I have it all tape-recorded. All of it. I need direction in this matter. I have two cases filed on this. Looks like I’m fixing to lose everything: $5000 truck, rent house, a good job making 100k a year. I was not able to make down payments. Currently living with sister. I’m stressed with no way out. Total humiliation!
After filing with H&R Block, my family member was asked if she wanted the anticipation loan in which she was later found to be declined. Understanding filing fees is one thing, not telling people they still get charged is not right. Don't give me the fine print scam bologna. It’s a bad way to do business. What's the credit check for? The money is from the government. There is no payback schedule. Scam!
I've been reading the articles complaining about HR Block's Refund Anticipation Loans (RALs) and the allegation that they target low-income taxpayers, those that receive EITC. I worked one season at Block many years ago and "sold" many RALs to customers. I can personally attest to the following: 1) We were never told to target anyone or any group. 2) We were told to offer the RAL to everyone receiving a refund. 3) We always explained that it was a loan that would be paid off by the refund--one of the papers was the loan application and another was the authorization for the IRS to pay the loan off (I think it was a direct deposit to the loan account). 4) We, at least I, always explained the the fees associated with the RAL, how much their refund should be, and how much they would be getting back. 5) It was the customer's option whether to pay for the preparation fees from the refund via the RAL. They could have paid for the preparation by any means. 6) Some of the low-income people I served probably would not understand adjusting withholding, probably not trust changing the amount to have more during the year, and probably not change it if they thought it would reduce their IRS refund. I really don't think many of them understood what was going on. We sold the RALs with all information up front. We are not the low-income people's keepers. It is their responsibility to make decisions; we informed them of the facts. Nobody twisted their arms. How far will society go to protect people from themselves? I also have this to say. The group of people these articles say were victimized may very well have been desperate for money, so much so that the difference between the 2-day RAL and the 4 to 6 weeks for the check was going to make real difference to them. The 2-week direct deposit was not an option for many of these customers, as they often did not have a bank account, as odd as that sounds. Also, these are people who are used to cashing checks at check-cashing businesses which charge outrageous fees, so HRB's RAL rate was probably not unusual. As for the high rates, they probably could be lowered, but there is a probably small risk with RALs, such as the IRS have court-ordered withholding for child support or other reason. Again, such actions are probably taken against low-income people more often than not. There is cause and effect here, but I believe that the low-income people are not being victimized by HRB, at least not any more than any other business. If the government wants to help raise people out of poverty, then create jobs for them, lower their tax liability, etc.
On Febuary 15, 2010, I went to H&R Block to apply for the RAL. Since the early 80's, I've been filing my income tax refund, and would receive my refund within two to three weeks. When I talked to Betty, she guaranteed that I would be able to get my refund in two days. A day later, the bank called me and asked me three questions. I was able to answer one of the questions concerning a car I had in the past. The other two questions were on two individuals I do not know, or have never met, and failed the questions. I was not approved to receive my refund in two days. I called Betty and explained what happened. She said I would receive my refund on my card on February 26, 2010, and IRS confirmed the same. I was okay with that. On February 26, 2010, I waited until 2:00 PM, and had not received my refund. I called Betty at H&R Block. She was on her day off. I talked to another representative who said there was nothing they can do, and gave me the number to HSBC Bank, and talked with them. They said that they sent the refund back to IRS, and it will take 6 to 8 weeks to receive my refund on a paper check. Now, I was very upset. I could have gone online to the IRS website, did my tax refund, and received my refund in eight days on my debit card. The only thing H&R Block and HSBC Bank did was use me, and lied to me. As a professional company, I am really disappointed, and will never use any agency to do my tax refund. I am out of work. It caused economic an physical consequences. It put me in a situation, that I had to lie to my landlord about paying rent, and sleeping out on the street. I was emotionally stressed out for seven days, going back and forth with H&R Block, and HSBC Bank, and IRS, trying to get the correct information, to find out were is the refund that was sent back. Today is March 4, 2010, and I have not received the refund.
I went to H&R Block for the early loan at Christmas and was approved for a $900.00 loan. Before I took the loan, I asked my preparer how and if I could reserve some of the loan for my payments. She replied yes. I asked her how much could be reserved and she told me as much as I wanted of the $900.00 could be reserved and could only be taken out of reserve by me calling and having it transferred to available credit. So I reserved $100.00 for the use of making my payments. Well, when I called to make the transfer, the money was not there. I tried to speak to a representative and couldn't get anywhere. Due to the fact of broken English and unable to understand what happened to the money, I gave up and decided to take the matter up when I filed my taxes. Needless to say, the payment did not get paid because I relied on H&R Block to have the money reserved for me to use for that purpose. Now, upon filing my taxes with my W-2, I asked the preparer if they had a way to look up where the emerald money was spent and he told me no, it was my responsibility to keep receipts. I explained to him about reserving $100.00 for my payments and he said he didn't think they could do that. So, moving on to filing my taxes. After applying all the information needed from the W-2 and I.D., he started asking me personal questions that the computer is prompting him with, such as: how much I pay in rent, utilities, leisure, phone, child care, food, etc. I didn't think any of that was anyone's business but he said that he could not proceed without the information. Anyhow, after my whole life history, he asked if I wanted the RAL loan or the Classic loan. I told him whichever is quicker and cost effective. Well, it turns out that I didn't qualify for either one due to a tax off-set. He acted like he didn't know why I wasn't approved but I saw a tax code pop up on the screen after denial. I still got charged the fees for not receiving the product. I also had to wait 14 days after filing, for the IRS to do the off-set, and H&R Block to send me the remaining balance. Talk about black-balling. People are in need of every penny they are expected to get back and H&R Block is a predatory company posing promises they can't deliver. Shame on you! You have lost my loyalty.
We used their Emerald Advance line of credit. When our refund came in, we paid it off before 2/15/10 and were charged another finance charge. I tried to dispute this but they said it took 4 days to post to our account but cleared the bank before the due date. They would not help us and refused to take the charge off, so I will not use them again they are rip offs.
I've paid for the 8-15 day service on the 4th of February 2010. I was supposed to get my taxes back on the 12th of February. Now, they said they made a mistake. I will get them back on the 19th of February. Today is the 20th of February. I called them today, and now, they said on the 23rd of February, it will be in. I hate being lied to, especially if I'm paying for a service that they supposedly stand by, but to no avail. They said they had direct deposited it by text message. Where's my money then? I'm about to deploy, and I have stuff to buy and bills to pay. I've been using these "tax professionals," paid some $300.00 to get something that I could get on post for free and faster. I'm done with H&R blockheads. After 12 years of doing business with them and $3,600 later, they do this. OK, it's time to go somewhere else. I'm just warning you from my experience.
I went last week to do my taxes and they told me that the cash back did not start until the 16th of February which was fine but now the 16th has come and gone and they are saying that the cheque printer is broken and they have no idea when it will be fixed and that they hope they have not caused an inconvenience to me but they are not giving any of us waiting on the service. They promised a break in the fees. I find that very unfair to the public for a business to state that they will deliver a product on a certain date and not deliver without some kind of compensation to the consumers. They have been very snotty on the phone with a bunch of us as I have friends that have done their taxes there also. And if they haven't fixed the problem in one working day don't you think that they should maybe get a new machine because cheques is their business and it is improper to promise a product if they can't deliver it.
I went to H&R Block to get the 2-day refund because I needed the money to keep me and my family from being evicted. Upon redoing my taxes that I had already done myself, I was told I wasn't approved for same day program. But I was approved for the 2-day refund via the emerald card. It was a Tuesday when this took place. I was promised the money would be on my card no later than 1 pm Thursday. The tax preparer even pointed on the screen guaranteeing that I was approved. On Thursday at 3 pm, I called and asked where the money was. I was told since it was the second release date for E-File with the IRS that the excessive number of refunds being processed was the reason for the delay and that by Monday for sure the money would be on the card. Monday came and went along with my 5-day cancellation period. It wasn't until Tuesday that I wasn't approved. The first thing out of my mouth was, "Maria said and showed me that I was approved." Now, I come to find out that somewhere around Feb. 23, I will finally get my money. The only reason I paid almost $400 was to get the money as soon as possible to get caught up on my rent. I can't believe I have to wait as long as I would have had just mailed it. Now when I finally do get my money, I will be out at least $300 for them to basically copy my returns and input into their computer. I hope that the preparer (data entry clerk) had no idea that this could happen because I made her aware of why and how desperately needed that money ASAP. I hope that she just didn't tell me what I wanted to hear just so she could make her quota and/or commission. Now, not only have me and my family had to vacate our home to avoid an eviction but I paid a lot of money to be put off by various excuses long enough that I couldn't cancel their "Rapid Refund" process. My guess would be to ensure they got paid. But I end up waiting as long as I would have had I just mailed them in. I am being charged to have someone enter data off of pre-prepared tax forms. I am totally disgusted with misleading and diversionary tactics just for a few hundred dollars. I thought it was just my bad luck but come to find out I am one of many, many people that the exact same thing has had happen to them. One would think this practice would eventually put them out business but unfortunately, there will always be lower level tax bracket people in a desperate situation such as myself, who will be suckered in by the misleading advertising, the preparers assuring the customer that it's that quick and simple and approved. The total disregard of full disclosure of exactly what you're getting into, I feel there was no attempt to inform but to deceive people into signing and then put off long enough with reasonable to almost lame excuses for the 5-day period to expire so that there would be no way out for the client. The worst of it all is that they get their slice of my money before I get mine. The additional hardship this has caused is very difficult to deal with. They may have knocked me down thinking I am a "victim", but they are going to eventually find out that I am a fighter. They may not refund my money they extorted from me, but I'll do my best to ensure as few people as possible will fall into HR Blocks trap. I lost my residence due to the fact my landlord did not believe what happened to me at H&R Block. We (my girlfriend and our son) have been hopping from friends' houses and to family members' houses not wanting to overstay our welcome. The stress of an already terrible economic time compounded by this major setback. I lost my job seven months ago and have been on unemployment. My girlfriend's hours were cut from 38 hours a week down to as few as 6 hours a week the first of the year.
With a credit score of above 730 (excellent range), I was also denied an Emerald Card. This the first time in 30 years that I have been denied any loan or purchase based on credit. At one point an HR Block official told me the card was activated with funds. She was surprised that I was denied after I gave her a copy of my credit scores which were current for that day and had a year graph showing that they were 761, 748, and a few months earlier one score was above 800. I called and it still has not been activated.
My account with this card was fraud on Jan 25 2010. After 2 days, it was cleared up, old card cancelled and new card issued. Then on Feb. 1, 2010, the charges were reapplied to my account which put me in the negative. The Fraud Dept has no reason for this and the bank refuses to give me back my money. I have been working to get this resolved since Feb 2, 2010. I have contacted an attorney, Arizona Attorney Generals Office and filed a complaint, Pima County Sheriff's to file a report. This bank keeps giving me a run around. And I still have not gotten my money back. I have 8 pages of note of who I talked to and when. I have even gone back to the H&R Block office where I applied for my taxes at and Ed ** is getting the run around with no results. No one can give me a number directly to the Bank that has my account. I am unable to pay my bills or use any of my money to provide for my family. I am getting shut off notices for my utilities. I have spent over 30 hours on the phone with day after day phone calls to get this resolved, plus it is affecting my ability to do my job properly. I am distracted with this issue.
I was told I could get an Emerald card and would get the money in 2 working days. They lied to me and will not call me back.
I am very upset. I thought I would be getting my RAL loan in 2 days, but I was told when I called to check to see if my check was there that it would be 8-15 days. H&R Block knew this from the beginning. They should have told people this. I had to hear about this after the fact. Now everybody is talking about this. This has put me in the hole!
Me and my husband filed in the office and got the 24 to 48 hour return which cost a good penny. The next day I was told our check was in. We got there and they couldn't find it in our file. Me and my husband tried tracking our return but no info was found on use. Come to find out they never even processed it and got my social number wrong. Now it's been a run around ever since. Now three days later, no tax return info was processed after the office called and said it has been but chase tax customer service where the return is processed through, can't find nothing and still H and R Block wants to charge us the amount to get the return in 24 to 48 hours, when its been way over that time. ($400 to file the next day charges).
I can't really complain about this year's tax preparation with H&R in reference to the Emerald Card or RAL as we decided not to ever do that again. The tax preparer was great as every year and let us make all the decisions and did not try to sell us a financial product! Instead, we were stupid enough to go for the RAC option to receive our tax refund as a direct deposit within 2 weeks. Why? Well, we don't really know. After we filed, we realized that we could have filed electronically ourselves directly to the IRS, which would have eliminated a $29.95 fee. Now, our return will first go to HSBC to sit around in their account for 3 days so they can make some interest and then they will deposit the money into our account. I just checked with the IRS and the 8-15 days are now turning into 21 days (maybe even more). So, next year we will file electronically ourselves and eliminate any costs to third parties. We thought the RAC would be faster than the regular electronic filing of taxes but this is turning out not to be true and will actually take longer! Everyone should do their taxes themselves next year. Do not do RALs or RACs or the Emerald Card. It is a rip-off.
I went in to get my taxes done on January 22, 2010. I paid for the e-file to get a refund back in 2-3 days on my emerald card, and I still haven't heard anything yet. I'm very upset about this; I was deceived by this company. And it's withholding tax information about not telling I can carry more than 2 children. I am very displease right now. I will never use them again, because bills are not getting paid. You only get this money once a year. I will not recommend anyone to them. They need to get it together; they lose clients like false advertisement. This happened 2 years in a row.
Two days and three, yes I said three, filings later, they are finally submitting my refund. I did the RAL today--2 days filing and their system told them that my taxes would be better filed under Single and not Head of Household. Now, instead of getting my money today, I'll have to wait for up to two more days. Yeah, I gained $47.00. But the point behind the matter is this: The tax preparer I dealt with should have at least notified of the "system" rejecting my submission. I mean, after all, I paid them almost $300 to file my taxes, and all I get is empty promises. And now, I am not even sure I will get my refund in two days. No matter how much I try to think positive, there are a lot of negative stuff about H&R Block that I wish i would have read about. At least then, I would have went to Jackson Hewitt.
I went to H&R Block for one reason only, I wanted to get the Refund Anticipation Loan. I already did my own taxes but agreed to pay the fee in order to get the RAL. I told the preparer the only reason I would agree to pay the fees is to get the RAL. She said yes, I would be getting it in 2 - 5 days and that they would call me when it was in. I called them after three days and was told I would not be getting anything for 15-21 days. I called Chase bank to see why. The auto phone line said that I did not get the refund due to either my AG income or because I did not get my refund via direct deposit last year. Are these requirements to get the RAL? Where does it say that on any p/w? H&R Block verbally agreed that I would be getting a RAL. I am so frustrated! read more hide
I went out to do my taxes like every year at a local H&R block. I applied for the instant refund (got it every year in the past), and they denied me. I was kind of shock, but the person there assured me that I'll be receiving it soon. I said, "I paid for that service, the 3oo+ dollars." The lady said, "Well, you should get it in 2 days or less." I thought to my self I can wait for 2 days. Well, it's been 4 days! Nothing.... They lied! They took my money. I'm reading over people's similar situation, and I'm sure I can kiss that money goodbye. I could have done it myself and waited the 8-15 day process for the check to come. Don't go to H&R BLOCK. read more hide
On January 15th, we went to H&R Block to file our taxes. My husband has been out of work for 2 years so we need the money very bad. We decided to go do the RAL, like we have for the last 13 years and have been approved for the same day. There was a few concerns that we had and asked questions the woman that was doing our taxes and was training with another woman. Yes, this should have been a red flag, but we went on with it. We had went to H&R Block the year before and they had messed up on our taxes and was told that we would get a discount this year when we filed because we were such good customers. When we were all done we told them, about the discount and of course they couldn’t find that anywhere. They called the office manager of the other location where we got them done the year before and she said, “Oh, give them $25.00.” Needless to say, every returning customer got $25.00 off, so that was no discount. We found out about that later. Then we were told that we were not approved for the same day, but "congratulations" you are approved for the 1-2 day classic RAL. We left there with no money, but knew just like all the other years we would have it in a couple days. We called on Monday and still no money. We then called H&R Block and they said, “Well, it being a holiday, it should be in there tomorrow.” Well, I called the next day, which was now the 4th day, and no money. I called H&R Block back and they couldn’t help me. They gave me a number to the bank. I called the bank and they said that my return had been denied because the amount that I was receiving could be held up by the IRS. Are you kidding me? I finally get someone at the bank, a real person and not a recording, and the gentleman proceeds to tell me, "I’m sorry, ma’am, it’s not only you, it’s everyone." When I asked why, he said, “I don't know. You will be getting a letter in the mail.” So I called H&R Block back, they haven’t heard of such a thing and there is nothing that they can do. “That is not us, that is the bank doing that.” When I told this woman that I am broke and they guaranteed my money and that I was paying an enormous amount for this service that they are offering, she said, “Well, you shouldn’t spend something until you have it in your hand.” Now, I’m extremely angry. They are not standing behind their product that they are advertising and do not care about anyone other than themselves. I would have never gone there and spent over $261.00 for them to do my taxes when I can do them myself for free. I will never return to this place. They also told me, “Well, don’t worry, you won’t have to pay the $111.00 that we charged you for the RAL fee, you will only be charged $29.00 for your refund to be put on your emerald card. Are you serious? I shouldn’t have to pay a thing for their screw up last year and this year. This place is a joke. They also told us that we would not be getting the home heating credit and that we did not qualify for the home buyer credit even though we paid off our house this year. I don't think that they know any of the laws. Whatever anyone does, do not use them again. read more hide
I went in to have my 2009 taxes done as I do every year and this was the first year that my RAL loan was not approved. I went into the office in December and got a $900 cash advance like I do every year with no problem. The problem I am facing now is when the loan for the same was not approved, the lady proceeded to say the money will be on my emerald card in two days and I have not received nothing and I paid for that service. The person who prepared my taxes did not take the time to explain what had happened and if I were going to receive anything. This is the first time in five years this has happened. read more hide
We went to H&R Block on January 15, 2010 like we do every year to have our taxes filed. We have went with the rapid refund every year and never had any trouble. Now, they put us in the RAL category without telling us about the problems they had been having. We are now waiting on a letter from HSBC- Delaware and New York to let us know why we can't have our money. They are holding it. The IRS said that there was no reason for them to be holding the money but no one will tell us anything. We don't know what to do! Please help us. We needed this money rapidly because our car was about to break down and we needed to fix it. Now because of this waiting and not knowing period, the car has already broken down and now needs a tow. Also, we all might lose our jobs due to no transportation and no money to call a taxi because they are holding our money! read more hide
Do not use them this year! They are having major trouble with the lenders and most people aren't getting approved for the RALS. Use someone else this year! I used H&R Block for 20 years, as long as I've been doing my taxes, and this year their lender, HSBC, has screwed up mine and a lot of other people’s. Please, if you do nothing else, listen to this. If you really need your money go through one of the other places this year. I am being told that they are dropping this lender and getting a new one for 2011. Well, I will have to wait 15 days for mine, I have gotten mine for the last 7 years on the same day I did my taxes, and this year, it denied me. Why? Because I got an Emerald Card Advance. That was the excuse to me, others are getting other stories. Last year it went all smoothly. I paid back last year’s Emerald Advance on time. I even took out a loan in December and paid it off on time, but not with this company. I have poor credit score, but I have never, in 20 years had this problem with H&R Block. I am never going back. I found out I could have gotten mine back in 7 days if I would have done it myself and way cheaper, too. I am living with my mother who is in the throes of chemo and radiation and having to pay the bills and try to nurse her as best I can. I have a $700.00 electric bill I need to pay and now I am not able to. My son needs a truck and I found the perfect one, only $600.00. By the time I get my refund, it will be gone. He was going to go to work and help with the bills. I have never been so mistreated. My preparer was the best. It's that HSBC that is **! They are lying thieving jerks. And I won't be doing this next year, in fact, look for me on Craigslist everywhere. I am going to make sure no one uses this company if I can help it. read more hide
I went into H&R Block on January 18, 2010 to file my taxes, this was my first year to not be claimed by my father. I had a refund of $2000 coming to me and I asked for the 1-2 day refund. I was in no way shape or form told that this was a loan that would be requiring a credit check or anything else. I have used H&R Block for about 6 years now, I even brought them my father and younger sister as customers but they have officially lost me. It is now January 24th and I have no clue when my money will be in. I get the run around every time I call and no one can explain why my loan was denied. I have done the 1-2 day refund several times before and never had a problem until now. I would rather risk doing my taxes on my own and facing a penalty then ever going back to H&R Block. They are sneaky and do not inform you of all the necessary information. I feel like their employees are under educated for what their responsibilities hold. Goodbye H&R Block, happy scamming! I have a vehicle that needs to be in the shop badly and I was counting on this money to get it fixed and now I will have to continue to drive my vehicle and risk more damage. read more hide
I have been filing with H&R Block for thirteen years now. All thirteen years, I have received the advance with no problem and sometimes, the same day and sometimes, the next day; it's no big deal. This year, I had decided that I was going to do my own taxes because I was not in dire need of the money this year. Well, something came up and I needed the money so I went into a local office and filed for the instant. The lady comes back and says the instant was denied but I will get my money within one to two days. I asked if she is sure and she said yes. I said ok and asked if there is anything that would stop from getting it tomorrow or Saturday, and she said that the only thing that would stop it is if I had some sort of red flag on my taxes. So I get up this morning and called the card to see if it was on there. I get a message saying that it was denied and that I will get the refund in eight to fifteen days after acceptance from the IRS. I have to admit that I was freaking out trying to figure out who I could possibly owe money to. I called my student loan holders just to make sure somehow that I didn't go into default or anything like that. I have yet to call H&R Block but believe me, I will as soon as I get off at work and in an area where I can speak freely. I will never go back to H&R Block. They should let customers know that it is not a guaranteed process anymore no matter how many years you have been using them. They are crooks and are only out to get the poor man's money. Do you think that a person with money would need a RAL? I think not. Make the rich man richer while making the poor man poorer! The filing fees was $341 something that I could have done myself for free. The only reason I even had them do them is the RAL, which I didn't get. The reason I needed the money is because my truck had broken down and I had it at the shop. After being assured that there was not a problem with me getting my refund today, I told the mechanic to keep the truck and fix it. Well, now my truck is ready to be picked up. I guess I'll try and figure out how to get it out in eight to fourteen days. read more hide
My husband and I went to HR Block this year instead of Jackson Hewitt praying it would be different. But so far guess what, it’s not. We plainly asked not one person but two if we could get the RAL check if we were new customers and they both said yes, positively yes. Our credit is not bad so I know that is not it. She put it in and it was denied for money now and said it would be there the next morning but it’s not. We went on 1-20-10. It’s the next day only but it’s not here. They called early this morning to inform us that it’s going to be 8 to 14 days. Any other time you can’t get them on the phone, but she called early so they know exactly what they’re doing. They’re very prepared to lie to honest people this year and cover their tracks to get your return in there to charge all those charges not regulated. And they know you can’t get it back or your taxes back after it goes through. If they cannot back what they’re telling people and this is a public business, then it is false advertisement and this should be stopped. They plainly lied knowingly and I think they are trained to do this. HR Block should stand accountable for this now. read more hide
I went to the local H & R Block as I do every year, filed for the 1 or 2 day anticipation loan and was charged over $400 to do this. I called and called for two days with a zero balance on my emerald card. I finally called back and spoke to the woman who did my taxes and she said that the bank had denied me. I too was in desperate need of the money, trying to move, no gas, no groceries and now I owe them over $400 and still no loan. I had never been denied and do not understand why I have been this year. I will never use H & R Block again. I would like to warn others of this so that hopefully they will not get caught up into the same fraud. read more hide
We filed our taxes the same way for 16 years. We paid all the fees to have rapid refund, but the only thing they forgot to tell us was that H&R Block bank was doing credit checks this year. Our preparer failed to tell us that there would be credit check. If I had known that they were going to to do a credit check, that would have changed our mind about filing with H&R Block. Now, we have to pay a fee and wait 8-15 days. I am not happy with H&R Block so as many others. The bank told me it was due to the economy but our credit history has been the same for years--not good, but we always got an anticipation loan. What makes this year any different, I think, is that every body has got on the bandwagon about the economy. I think that H&R Block knew that they weren't going to give out anticipation loans so you would file and still owe them processing fees. It's funny how our preparer Morris ** failed to tell us that there are going to be credit checks this year. Thanks. read more hide
M daughter filed for "instant refund" on Jan. 15. This is one W2 form, simple! She was told to get money in two days. The money didn't come. First, they had transmitted the wrong name for her son. Then, they said it has been re-transmitted 6 or 7 times but was rejected by IRS and no rejection reason was given. They say for her return is in no man's land. No idea when/if problem will be fixed. I tried to help her by calling H&R Block management. I found out that it's H&R Block's policy that their people aren't allowed to give out contact info, phone numbers or names of any management people about the district managers. District manager here said check would be there this morning. No check, no explanation. Incredible. read more hide
I went to file taxes and the tax prep did not tell me if I did not get approved. For one to two days, I would still have to pay $288 plus $30 bank fee. If I had known this, I would have went to CRT and had it done for free and waited the 8-15 days--without losing anything. After arguing on the phone with about eight different people, I finally got the district manager. She said that all she can do is take 50% off of the $288 but I would still have to pay the $30 bank fee after arguing for almost an hour. read more hide
I filed my taxes on 1/19/2010 the same way I do every year. I have filed at H&R for about 10 years. This year,I even took out a $1000 Christmas advance. I didn't think any thing about it, because I did the same thing last year. When I did my taxes, I did the RAL 1-2 days and was approved for my Christmas Advance loan in Dec., so I see no problem. The next day I called to see if the money was on my card. No, I was denied! Okay, I'm not mad yet! I called HSBC (the lender)! I was transferred to the collection Dept. The lady pulled up my account and said I owe H&R Block $429 from "2004". Now I'm a little upset, so I asked "Why did you wait almost 7 years to tell me?" I heard 100 excuses and not one made sense to me. She told me I would have to call H&R Block and find out. I told her I have done my taxes with H&R Block for almost 10 years and not once have I been denied anything nor was I told I owed them any money. I asked her why don't you just take the $429 out of my loan this year and HSBC said the IRS won't let them. I called H&R Block and was told I didn't owe them nothing and they would further investigate the problem. I went into the office to cancel my loan and first was told I couldn't; it was too late. Then I showed them the letter I signed that stated I could and was explained to that I have five days. I was then told that I can only cancel the loan, but the IRS won't let them cancel after they accepted the taxes. No one knew what they were doing and I ended up having to talk to three different people and still nothing was done. It is the second day of the five days this letter says I have to cancel and I have to wait for a manager to come in and do the process. When I asked for a copy of the letter, I turned in " Notice of Cancellation"; the lady said I don't know if my copier works! I told her I wanted a copy or I would go get a copy and come back. Well, apparently her copier worked because she came back with one. Now she is wanting to try to talk me out of canceling and tells me they are going to use a different lender next year and my answer is I still want to turn it in, I want to cancel! The lady at H&R Block then says. "Well, it is only going to hold up your check for five or six months." I asked."Why!?" When the IRS send HSBC your check, they will have to send it back and the IRS will have to print you out a new check. Okay, now I'm mad!" I have been sent on a runaround for the last 4 hours and nothing can be done. I told the lady at H&R Block I was going to call the IRS and I don't care how long it will take me to get my check if I cancel! I want to cancel and HSBC wasn't getting another penny from me and they lost a customer! Now I have to wait for a manager to call me and I only have five days to cancel! It is day three today and I will be sending a certified letter to cancel to H&R Block and HSBC! My last day of work is 1/29/2009 and I will have no job! I needed that money for bills and to help support my kids, not to mention the $16 it will cost for the certified letter or the gas for the runaround they keep sending me on, the hours on the phone and being put on hold. I never expected this, every other year only took about an hour and I was done! These companies are misleading and dishonest. I think they have made a mistake somewhere and I'm paying the price! read more hide
Just like quite a few people on here, I as well went into an office to see about getting my refund a little faster than usual. When I was denied for the instant RAL, I knew that my chances were slim that I would qualify for the classic. At this point I wanted to cancel the whole thing. However, I was assured that I would be approved for the classic by both the preparer and office manager. Well, I was not! Not only that but he gave me information that was incorrect, such as calling the Emerald card customer service number to see why I was denied. Emerald card is an HR Bank product, not an HSBC product. I am just as upset as any other person who has experienced the same thing. I am in the process of attempting to get my fees refunded to me (almost $300.00). This refund could have been done online for free! My refund is now $300 less than it should be. read more hide
I had heard about the H&R Block Emerald Card the year prior. This year, there was going to be a family reunion so I needed my money a little faster than the standard two-week waiting period for e-filing. I went in to my local H&R Block office, and went through the relatively painless filing process. I had gone in because of a couple of changes to our financial situation, and had a difficult time finding the answers to my questions online. My preparer was pleasant and helpful, and answered the questions I had about these changes. I told him that I wanted to get the two-day Emerald Card RAL, and we went through the standard paperwork. My problem lies in the lack of explanation about the approval process for this loan though their individual bank, HSBC. It was not made clear that I was approving a credit check while I had papers pushed in front of me at a fast enough pace that I was not able to read all the fine print. And when I was told that I had not been approved for the loan when I called, I was admittedly upset. I called my local H&R Block office, and the receptionist explained very pleasantly and understandingly that I would now have to wait the normal two weeks, but that the money for the two-day RAL would be credited when I received my money, which was a small consolation. It still means that I paid roughly $150 for a process I could have done personally for closer to $35 (the amount for the two-day RAL), and could have simply called down with my questions. If you have any doubts about your credit in any way, shape, or form, let it be known that you will most likely not be approved for the RAL, so you should save yourself the money of applying with H&R Block if you have a fairly simple return. It's unfortunate that I notice the same problem quite frequently from other people, and H&R Block does not have the foresight to train their tax preparers to inform you of a very important bit of information--that could easily change your decision to file with them. I understand that they are a business and this is one way they make money, but it is still dishonest and callous, especially in these difficult economic times. read more hide
I have been a loyal Jackson Hewitt customer for about seven years. But for some reason, they were not able to do the RAL loan this tax year. So I decided to try H&R Block. On Saturday the 16th, I sat down with Barbara to do my taxes. It didn't take anytime at all, she told me my refund amount and I told her I wanted to do the RAL, she said okay and started the process. She told me that she had to do the instant RAL and then if I wasn't approved, we could do the Classic RAL. I told her I was never approved for the instant because my credit is bad. She said no problem, it should be approved if your refund is big enough. I thought oh, okay, maybe it is different here. Nope I was not approved, I knew that I wouldn't be so I asked her so not being approved for the instant won't affect, my classic will. She said, "No, not at all. You should receive your check no later than Tuesday (the 19th)." I said, "cool." I joked with her that at Jackson Hewitt, I always got my check on the Martin Luther King Holiday and I never could get it cashed until Tuesday, anyway so no problem. The office owner/manager Chris came over and said, "Hi" and welcomed me from Jackson Hewitt. She said Jackson Hewitt can't do the RAL this year. I said no they can't and she said, "well I am glad that you chose us to get you your money faster." I said she should be getting a lot of people from my work because we always use Jackson Hewitt but now that we can't get our money fast, we would chose them because they are the only one in our area that does the RAL. She said good, glad to hear it. I signed my forms and off I went to work. Well, I called Monday to check the status of my refund only to discover that the bank denied me because of my guess, what poor credit score. I was furious. I called the local H&R block office and the office manager told me that I should be grateful that they saved me money, that going to Jackson Hewitt was expensive and they saved me from their fees. I was even more furious. I told her, "I don't give a ** about fees, I wanted my refund fast, which is what you guaranteed." I told her that I was told that my refund would be here by the 19th and now it won't be. She said, "well, we have some inexperienced tax preparers. I will talk to her about that." I said, "what they don't have experience with dealing with customers but they can do my taxes?" I called the customer hotline only to be told, "well you need to call the bank." I called the bank, all to no help. They said, "well you were denied a loan." I said, "I know but I don't understand. I have received my refund for over 7 years with Jackson Hewitt with no problems." She said, "well they don't use the same bank we do." Well duh, I knew that she said that she was sorry for the inconvenience but there was nothing she could do. So here I am now paying expensive tax preparing fees that I could of done myself online at the IRS website and with the same results. I think the HSBC bank and H&R Block are scamming their customers. I have to pay over $180 for preparer fees when I could of done this myself. I went there with the confidence that I could get my money fast. The only thing H&R Block is good at is getting your hard earn money fast for them. read more hide
I went to H&R Block after they sent me an invitation to receive an emerald advance. I received $900, as usual. Cool. When I went to file my W-2, I was very specific at the fact that I only wanted to file my return electronically because they stated they could get me more money. I did not want to participate in anything, just give me my money! This incompetent filer, who also is a teacher that runs his mouth excessively, charged me twice for my emerald advance, did not give me a card, did not sign the tax preparer slot, did not discuss my return, didn't do squat like my previous experiences. Personally, I think he is scamming somehow. I haven't figured it out yet but I will. I called customer service and got dissed by a bunch of Mexican or Indians, got dissed by the office, stating they could not pull it out and he was the only one that could. And he was off all weekend? I am powerless because of the retarded mistake or scam he committed and I hate H&R Block so bad. It is my life mission to drive them out of business. They are the most unprofessional overpriced predatory lending establishment ever! read more hide
I had gone to my local H&R Block office like I did last year to see if I could get the LOC loan. Last year, I got the full amount, $1,000, and paid it back in full when I did my taxes. This year, I went back to do it again so I could have extra money for Christmas and bills. They denied me for some reason and didn't tell me why. I tried calling H&R Block's main office to find out what was going on and got no response. They lost my business and I have been with them for over 16 years now. read more hide
I went to my local H&R block office in Bottineau, ND. I went to apply for one of the LOC loans. I waited in line for my turn. A guy was ahead of me and he claimed he filed single and then claimed his kids and he got the loan. It was my turn to go in and I went, gave the guy my information and then he told me my application was denied. I was mad. He could tell and I grabbed the paperwork and walked off. And he attempted to get me to come back. He quoted me as "most single people get denied this loan." I walked off even madder than before. I was like, "What, did you just discriminate against single people?" While I got a hold of the H&R block company and I filed a complaint and told them off. I told them that if they like discriminating against people filing single on their tax return, they do not need my business. That manager was trying to come up with excuses but I did not buy it. read more hide
I attempted to apply for H&R Block's Emerald Advance LOC (line of credit). Through H&R Block's subliminal advertising methods, they make it seem as though it is a simple process. I visited the office and I did an on-the-spot appointment to apply for the LOC. I was told by the front desk person that I would have to wait an hour because there were others ahead of me. There was no problem there. I went back an hour later and I was told to come back in another thirty minutes as it was not my turn yet. I empathized a little due to their office seeming busy at the time. After thirty minutes had passed, I went back again and I was told that it still was not my turn yet and that I would need to wait a few more minutes. Again, no problem with waiting. It was finally my turn after two hours of waiting and anxiety. I was waited on by a so-called tax professional, who went through H&R Block's computer process to apply for the LOC. She prompted me for my personal information and when she got to certain sections, she went through quick explanations of the process, which I did have to stop her on several occasions and question. The first instance occurred when she asked for my pay stub from my employer. I explained that I had been on unemployment for the entire year (unfortunately). She then began to populate the required fields on her computer with the corresponding information from my unemployment pay stub. I explained to her (although it may not have even mattered) that I have been an H&R Block customer for 5+ years and counting. I also explained to her that I had received the Emerald Advance last year, which I did pay off early. I mentioned these things to possibly add to my credibility, which it most likely didn't because she was going through H&R Block's applicant stipulation process. As the so-called tax professional went further into processing my application, I noticed that H&R seemed to be conducting some unethical business practices in their LOC approval process. First, I noticed that the system mentions through the application process that H&R Block Bank requires a $10,000 projected income for an applicant for the year of 2010. With this in mind, through the application process, H&R Block Bank also requires the applicant to pay the LOC off by February 15, 2010. This seemed downright crooked to me. In addition to the aforementioned stipulations placed against an applicant, H&R Block Bank also does a credit check for the LOC. This seems a little realistic, but still very unethical for the simple fact that many individuals (including myself) have given H&R Block Bank many years of loyal business (which was very expensive for their loan products). In addition, I received and paid off the exact same Emerald Advance LOC the prior year, as I had H&R Block prepare my taxes. Ultimately, tax clients who have their tax returns prepared by H&R Block and who are entitled to a tax refund are prompted by H&R Block to pay off their LOC through the tax preparation process. So no matter how you look at it, H&R Block Bank will get their money. On top of H&R Block Bank getting their money, they charge very high interest rates on their repayment terms since the LOC or other loan product will only be short term. How extremely unethical and devastating for the low income individuals and households that H&R Block targets. As I sat in the office where I applied for the Emerald Advance LOC, I noticed that the office was filled with minorities and other seemingly low income individuals. It is just so appalling to me that H&R Block does this to people and are still getting away with it. After my three hour ordeal with the LOC application process, as well as the poor treatment by the tax preparer, office manager and district manager, whom I confronted all about the issue, I was finally able to leave with some type of dignity. Yes, I do understand that I could have avoided even going to H&R Block, but their advertising is so subliminal and they fail to tell its customers/clients upfront about the stipulations regarding any of their loan products. The customers/clients usually have to find out the hard way (like I did) and suffer the complete humiliation of even attempting to apply for H&R Block's loan products. All in all, my experiences with H&R Block have been horrible over the last three years, but I continued to be a loyal yet unappreciated customer. I will never give H&R Block my business again, even when they eventually get sued out of business and possibly assume another entity that prepares taxes. I will definitely be keeping my eye on this and I hope others who view this learn from my experiences. read more hide
I am shocked to see so many bad experiences with H&R Block’s RAL. My husband and I both have very horrible credit, and we have always been told before we leave the office whether we were approved for the RAL or not. Well, this year our refund was close to $6,000.00 and we got the 1-2 day RAL. Well, our money was on our card sometime during the night, and we filed our taxes around 6 or 7 pm, and our money was on our card by 6 am the next day, and we were allowed to pull off as much money from the ATM as we wanted. I am really shocked that so many people have had problems with it. We even get approved every year for the tax loan that they offer at the end of the year. I love H&R block and I wouldn’t trust anyone else to prepare my taxes. read more hide
I went into H&R Block to do my taxes, and sat down to a wonderful nice lady who had assured me she had been doing taxes for 16 years. I explained to her I wanted to directly deposit my funds into my checking account as I have done every year. As I was calling my bank to get the info, she seemed to be stalling and single handedly went out of her way to get me to sign up for this RAL to get my money in 48 hours. I even supplied her with my routing/banking info and she still kept persisting. I was only getting 647 dollars back and going out of town in 4 days. That money looked good to me for the vacation as opposed to having to wait 8-15 days. I finally caved in and took a loss for the fees to get the fast refund and settled for 502 dollars. I kept saying over and over, “So it’s definitely going to be there within 48 hours, correct?” “Of course,” she told me what I wanted to hear. If she would’ve done her job and properly informed me verbally, that it was not a fast refund, it was just a loan from an independent bank that had no direct affiliation with them, I would have balked. In fact if they said, there is a 1% chance I won’t get the fast refund, I would have still balked. I know my credit is bad, and she never told me that I am authorizing them to run my credit. I tried to read most of the stuff she handed me. But I had like 60 papers to sign. Going back at everything I signed, I still can’t see where it says, “It is based on credit and I authorize them to check it.” All in all, this is a classic scam, or just really extreme ignorance on behalf of H&R Block. But it seems, based on reports, too much of this is happening. Why is H&R Block screwing their loyal customers in the worst economy in recent memory? I paid 150 dollars in fees/rapid refunds, to find out I got denied and have to wait 2 weeks like everyone else. But this time I’m cool because I have 150 dollars less, and a nice shiny green card that charges me every time I use it for normal transaction and daily ATM usage. Oh, by the way, to call H&R Block and tell them my story after getting hung up on and the runaround, they deducted $4.00 from me. So as of now, my tax refund is -4 dollars for the privilege of telling me I am **. Does H&R really expect to pull these practices and have repeat customers? Or, are they only focused on short term and knowing they will bank off the fees and scams they are pulling off their customers? read more hide
I went to H&R Block and asked for their RAL service, but I told them that I had my filing papers with me because I have already done my taxes online, but the reason that I went to them was that I needed my refund sooner than 8 to 15 days. Well, at first, when I talked to one of the employees on the phone, they told me that they would only charge me between 25 to 35 dollars because they had to redo them so they could have them on their computer. I said that was understandable as long as they could tell if I was not going to waste my money and not get the RAL refund. They said it would not be a problem. So a couple of days later, I went into the office to get the taxes done. Well, once I was there and they got started on them, they came up with a figure of around $170 so I explained to them what I had talked to them about my situation. The lady went to talk to the manager and said that the only thing they could do was give me a $50 discount but that would take a day for confirmation. I really didn't agree with that decision, but I needed to get them filed asap so I told them as long as they could tell that I would receive the RAL, I would accept. Again, they said no problem so I ended up paying about $250 with their service charge and the banks. Well, a couple of days later, I called and they told me that the bank did not approve me for the RAL. I was very disappointed because I ended up paying around $250 for something that could have cost me not a single penny but a push of a button when I did them myself online. It's like they aren't there to help their customers. They are there only to see how much money they can squeeze out of us. I will never ever again go for their service or even recommend their services, because they are a business with a bunch of lies and money hungry. I am very disappointed with H&R Block services! read more hide
We told the preparer that we were in dire straits to get our refund quickly, and he offered the Emerald Card. They added on fees for doing so, then told us that, since we filed before noon, the $ would be on the card by 6pm. We had called the # on the card last night, and all day today. Balance - $0. Finally got through to 'check on your status'. They said that we were denied the 'loan'. Likely, it was due to our bad credit score. We were not told that this was a loan, just a quick refund for a fee. I even asked the preparer if our credit could have any consequences, and he firmly said no. So, we called H & R Block, they apologized, but it still will not be on this card for another 8 - 15 business days. PLUS, there's a limit of $300 cash withdrawal per day, with a fee from $1.50 - $3.00 per transaction. All things we were not told. You can't take it to a bank and have the full cash taken out, since the cardholder name is H & R Block Client. They should TELL THEIR CLIENTS that it is a loan, and just like any loan, your credit score is a factor! We have $5.00 left to our name, have been unemployed for ages, and were counting on this money. Now we not only have to wait, but are being told how to spend our money and limited on how much we can have. We have bills up the wazoo, and were counting on this to help us make a dent. I will NEVER go back to H & R Block. I feel we were hustled into doing this. read more hide
I filed my taxes w/these people and was denied a RAL. Long story short I chose to have my refund deposited onto their Emerald Card. I filed on 02/26/2009 and the IRS claims it was direct deposited on 03/13/2009 but H & R Block continues to say they don't have it. I keep getting the run around and have called the IRS, H&R Block, and to no avail. Like everyone else we have bills due and I can't seem to get my money. We can't pay our bills as we were counting on this money to catch us up since I have been out of work due to an illness. read more hide
i have been going to h&r block for a few years. everything was good until i went to file with them this year. i got a letter in the mail about this loan up to 1000 dollars got excited christmas being around the corner. i took my last pay stub and she did her stuff got a loan for 500 dollard and the banks fee was 40 dollars. ok thats leaves 460 and my estimate refund was going to be about 2000 and that was not my last check. to my surprises i went a few weeks later did my taxes with this old lady who look like she didnt know what the heck she was doing. she enters all my info then she ask me if i had depents i said no (dont have kids yet), so then she ask me if i went to college i said yes i paid out of pocket for 1 class. i bring in the paper to show he. when everything was done she told me that day i couldnt finish because the irs havent realesed some documents yet. came back she explained everything to me. she told me my refund was going to be 1200 dolllars. then she told me that my loan was 527 intenrest fees. then she tell me its additional 200 dollars fee for their services. i asked her why she tells me oh those forms i was waiting for are adiitional 100 dollar it was only 2 MORE FORMS ( so she tells me my grand total was 250 out of 1200. well i thought i was getting a nice chunk of money back since i did a little more than last year well i was really wrong really wrong. read more hide
I did my taxes 2/19/2009 at the local H&R Block. I chose the RALoan just like I have every year for the last fifteen years. I have never had a problem. This year I was not approved,I just chalked it up to the economy and let it go. I received deposit confirmation from the IRS today, so H&R has my refund, but I have no money from H&R Block. They told me I would receive my refund on 3/6/2009. If I had chosen to receive a check from them it would cost $40.00 more dollars. The Emerald Card is the cheapest way to receive your refund. If I had been patient and bought software, done my taxes myself I would not only be wiser but wealthier(using that term loosely), and happier. If you haven't done your taxes yet, steer clear from H&R Block because they are truly racking up fees. I will only describe my situation as dire enough to want to pay for an ARL so I could receive my loan quicker. I haven't received child support on a consistent basis. I truly need the money. read more hide
I filed my taxes on Jan 23,2009 as with many others i asked for the Ral 1-2 day but i informed my preparer that i would be denied as i had been in the last 3 yrs but that i would probaley get it in 8-15 day. i paid 300.00 for this service. i am a single mother of a two yr old i needed my money quickly. i waited 2 weeks and when i called the local office to see where my money was they would just say that they did not have a check for me yet to call back in 24-48 hrs so i waited, i believe i was very patient then on feb 13, i called again and was told that h&r block had finished with me and that they did not know why my check wasnt there but that they could not help me anymore, so i called hsbc bank i was told that i only had 15 days to file a complaint before my money was returned to irs. they said my identity could not be confirmed and or a fraud alert was on my account, and that i could not get any more information at this time, i said well i would like to do what i can to fix this so i can get my money, they said i couldnt cuz as of that day the money was returned to irs. as irs had requested it back, so i called irs and was told that irs never request the money back becuase before they deposit the money they make sure that you do not owe any money so my refund was deposited on feb 6,209 and that i should have been issued a check on feb, 7 2009, when i informed them that i hadnt received it they told me to call hsbc back so this has gone back and forth for over a month now and i still have not received my moeny, but as of yesterday march 5th i received a letter form hsbc bank saying that i was denied ral and that my money was returned to irs , and that i could expect a check with in 4-6 weeks from date on letter, letter was dated feb 28th 2009 so i could have sent a paper return for free and still get my money in that amount of time,,= or i could have filed turbo tax my self and already have my money i beleive that something should be done and i hope that H&R block discontinues the use of RAL as it is definatly a SCAM to prey on people who are in need of receiving their money quickly otherwise why would you take a chance and loose 300 bucks, i am upset and confused as to how a company can continuely take money from innocent people and the Government hasnt stopped them and why are they doing it. this year i have read many complaints on this site and it seems to me that collectively there is enough complaints to shut a business down for such insufficient service. Because I didnt not receive my money in the 8-15 day time frame my cell phone was shut off as i was unable to pay the bill on time, and my bills are pileing up read more hide
I went into H&R BLOCK as I normally do every tax season. I went ahead and did my taxes as usual using the RAL for the 8-15 day loan ( they dont tell you its 8-15 business days) and paid 178.00 plus a 29.95 bank fee for federal and a 15.00 for state. I recieved my state in a little over a week and they took their fees right off the top. I have been waiting for almost 4 weeks to receive my federal and was finally told today i will be receiving it my march 14th, that will be over 6 weeks and they couldnt even tell me if it will be on my card or if it will come in the mail. I have been calling everyone i can at the H&R BLOCK company but yet i get the run around and have been told they WILL NOT REFUND my money that was paid to them already! I do not understand this if they are the ones who made the mistake, and if I had infact been told about doing my taxes for free on my own I would have done it! I do not have a hard tax return and it does not take a genius to do them! I WILL NEVER USE THE LYING THIEVING H&R BLOCK AGAIN IN MY LIFE! I WILL ALSO BE SITTING ON THE DOOR OF THE OFFICE LETTING PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT THE LIES THIS COMPANY TELLS!!!! I am a single mother of 2 going through a very hard time in my life right now. I am going through a divorce and I just moved here to Oregon to go to school. I was depending on this money to have my rent and my bills paid. My children and i will now be sitting cold in a dark apt with an eviction notice on our door. Wow! How can these people sllep at night knowing they ruin so many hard working people who have bills to pay and depend on this money at the time they say it will be here? If anyone from Oregon would like to be involved in a lawsuit please contact me. read more hide
Filed our taxes on 1-29-09. Still have not recevied our money on our emerald card. The IRS direct deposited it on 2-27-09 which was last friday. The bank H AND R BLOCK uses is HSBC and they claim they cant find the direct deposit. The emerald card is a scam they already took our whole State check for fees so we wont see any of that money. There emerald card is a joke and someone needs to find out where our money is. We were depending on a huge refund and were expecting 6,905$. we owe bills and need to live. this was supposed to be quicker to get our refund and they keep claiming it only takes 8-15 days and we have been waiting for near 35 days. its put a burden on us.
My husband and I went to H & R block on 2-14-09 to file our taxes. We were told that we will be recieving substantialy less this year than we have in the previous 9 years of filing with them, ok, 1378 instead of 3600 - thats a big difference but I can deal with that. We choose the 8-14 day ral because they did not tell us that if we did not apply for a ral it only takes 8-15 days to get your money from the irs. Important information to disclose. Then at the end the tax preparer tell us that it will cost almost $400 for us to file this year, before it was 195 at most, same info from previous years but this year the fees have gone up ALOT and the refunds have gone down ALOT. Of course, like everyone else we were denied for the 8-14 day RAL...but cant get our money back for their fees. seems to me like hsbc should provide a list of people who were APPROVED for the RAL - becuase the economy is bad, i personaly believe that they are denying EVERYONE and making ALOT of money from the fees! I am contacting an attorney tomorrow to look into a lawsuit. Oh yeah, and the IRS says that my refund was deposited onto my card on 2-27-09 - but the card says no money. I called the number and was told that HSBC band was holding my refund for internal reasons no specified. WHAT? You DENIED my loan, GIVE ME MY MONEY! I believe that they are denying everyones loans to collect the fees (becuase i have always gotten the loan in the past) and then keeping taxpayers deposited money in their bank for extended periods of time so they can collect interest on our money. well shoot, you for 400 in fees and now our interest, God only knows when my money will go into the bank!
I am filed my taxes with HRBlock for many yrs and I have always been denied the RAL. Year after year, I was told that I did not qualify for the RAL because I was not a true HRBlock customer. Does anyone know what a true HRBlock customer is? Please help me out, I am confused. This year I have received complementary calls from the manager stating that I should qualify for the RAL this year because I threatened to take my business dedication elsewhere. Thanks to all I have read about the rip-offs HRBlock are pulling and how they luring customers in with their lies and scams; I am one to say, I WILL NOT BE USING THEM EVER AGAIN.
I tried to use my atm card to withdrawl $500 from my emerald card at an atm. The atm said transaction cancelled, so I tried again and this time it gave me the $500. Then it gave me the receipt that said my balance was $1000 less than what it was when I pulled up to the atm. I looked at my card activity online and noticed that they charged me for the $500 that said transaction canceled. So I go in the bank and they tell me I have to contact HR Block, So I call them they tell me it shows I got the money, i say i know but i didnt. So they give me another number, I've tried it and been on hold for more than 45 mins three times then it asks if i want to leave a message so i did nobody called me back. SO I sent them an email, still nobody is getting ahold of me. I'm out $500. Plus the $2.50 they charged me for getting the money from the atm. I don't know where to go from here, anyone have any solutions? I needed the money to pay my gas bill. I got it paid when I got paid. But because I used my check to pay gas bill, had a hard time buying groceries for my 3 kids for the week.
I took my tax paperwork to them to be filed as I have for over a decade. Was told that I would receive my money (through a RAL) in cheque from to be picked up on Monday Feb 9th. Came in on the 9th, and was told that I should check back on the 10th. Checked back on the 10th and was told that the RAL was denied, no explanation, and would have to wait till the 20th. Checked with the IRS web site & it showed that my money had in fact been deposited on the 20th, so I called H&R Block. They stated that I would have to wait till the 21st, that it may take 24 hrs for it to show up. Called on the 21st and was told no cheque, will be in on the 23rd for sure. Well the 23rd I was told to check back on the 24th, 24th told the 25th. Today I called and was told that no cheques were in yesterday or today, and would be Friday the 27th. Still only getting well I don't know, and call this # (automated line that I sat on hold for 20min), and Well there is nothing I can do, etc. Is there anything that a person can do?
I went to have my taxes done on 1/21/09 and I was approved for the RAL and told was going to get it 1 to 2 days. I was then told after those days were up and still haven't gotten my money I was then told I would get it 8-15 days. It's 2/22 and still haven't gotten my money I keep getting the run around about where my money is. The IRS says that there is some kind of a hold up with my check but don't know what it is. Why in the world would they not know what it is? My electricity may be shut off sonn as well as my gas and my phone. Also I'm like almost 2 months late on rent.
Well just so everyone will know. I to used H&R Block services. But didn't go RAL. Paid $330.00. I got my tax money from state and federal back within 15 days. And that's after all the mistakes and I didn't have it direct deposited. Would have liked to but the preparer told me that wasn't available this year. But that was another incompetent mistake that was made because you can. Don't waste all that money on H&R Block services. The banks are turning down just about everyone due to the banks freeze on credit. You can should have your money back within 8-15 days without H&R Blocks RAL and, save yourself ALOT of money. Just read all these testimonials on this site. And know its true. I hope this is published because in the shape the economy is. You don't need to throw away $100'S of dollars, if you don't have to. They will tell you 1-2 days or 8-15. But after they fill out your taxes your committed to any and all fees.
I like many others went and applied for the ral in December knowing I would get my w-2 in January and be back on track well I did my taxes on the 15th and asked the quickest way which Esther the H & R Block agent stated the Emerald Card and withing 1-2 days I would have my federal available of course I paid a lot of money for this service and after 1,2 and 3 days went by I called the emerald card number (back of card) and WOW! talk about horrible customer service not only did the customer service reps. I spoke with provide me with false information I was hung up on several times including by a Supervisor. I was given the number to HSBC bank and of course not in service. I called the H & R Block number (800-hr-block) and when I got off the phone with them I was even more confused. I then called the location at which my taxes were filed and spoke to the Manager there named Brenda who stated that I owed $154. for State so the IRS would detach my refund. I explained to Brenda that Esther the agent that prepared my taxed had already given me a form to submit my state and I have already sent that in. Brenda didn't really know what to say except the IRS.gov website which indicated they hadn't received my refund yet and not to try back for at least a week. Talk about frustrated at this point I not only told Brenda the Manager that Esther the agent needed better training and to stop giving clients misinformation that I would be in to see her myself as at this point I want my fees for 1-2 refunded to me as well. The following day I received a call from Brenda who stated if I owe the state $154. for this year the IRS would not of taken the refund and she didn't know what to do except apologize and of course still no idea where my money is and the emerald card HSBC still has an outstanding balance as my RAL hasn't been paid yet. I have been going to H & R Block for 9 years and will NEVER do business with them again and will do my best to make sure other clients of H & R Block realize what;s going on and will probably be reporting to the Better Business Bureau as this is just not right. Regardless of the refund amount (which mines not great this year) it's the principle of being provided with not only misinformation but being provided with complete lines of [lies] as that's what all these agents try to do is tell you what you want to hear to get you off their phone, well that's if they didn't hang up on you first.
Went for 48 hour loan and never receive it. Office refuse to let me know about my 48 hour loan and charge me $165.00 to do my taxes. They avoided me all week I have to wait 8-15 days when I could of done this free. I will not throw my money away like this, I want a full refund I would of never agreed to wait 8-15 days when I could file for free and receive my money back in the same time. My tax guy knew I owed the IRS $60.00 and never told me that this will delay my refund. That is the part I am steamed at. Plus he put fake birthday on my paper work cause my licence was expired. I am paying late fees and car company wants there car back. Also I have a expired licence till I receive my money I cant drive I am upset, This company lied.
My wife and I had our taxes prepared through H&R Block to use their Rapid Refund program. We were not told the price until they were finished and then we did not get our Rapid Refund. We were told that it was due to not being able to confirm our identity. We then had our identity cofirmed through their process then was told that we still will not get it. We were told that they had recieved our refund from the IRS at that time. When asking why they then said they could not talk to us due to some confientiality law. We contacted many different people and finally worked our way up to the district manager of H&R Block. His name is D. Armijo. Our first contact with him has been over two weeks ago. We have been promised calls and updates since. He finally called yesterday morning stating that he contacted their bank for the Rapid Refund and was told that our refund was sent back to the IRS. I asked him why and what do I do to fix this. He called later yesterday afternoon and stated that we might get it this friday or we might not. I asked how we fix this and he stated he will find out and call my the lateset this morning with or without info. He still has not called. This is a big issue with me. It has takin over 2 weeks just to get the call yesterday. We have gotten nothing but the run around with H&R Block and we have not been able to get a straight answer from them. I called to H&R Block this afternoon to see if I can reach him and was told that he's been working on our issue since last week, which is not true because he stated that he just called them yesterday! Then we were told that we just have to buck up and deal with this! We were told that we will get our refund when we get it! We are upset due to paying a fee of almost $300.00 for their service then being treated this way. We have been more than polite and patient but that has finally ran out. We are hoping that we can get some direction or help with this matter. We needed to get this Rapid Refund to pay rent. We live in a Motel, pay weekly. We were needing this monies immediatly but thnk you to the manager, he is working with us. But as of tomorrow we will be out on the streets due to not getting our refund. Last week we had to goto a pawn shop and pawn our wedding rings to pay rent. If we are evicted tomorrow we will have a slew of trouble. We will probably lose our jobs, then our storage (where all of our belonging are), and our wedding rings. We are also out of the money that we paid to do the Rapid Refund!
My ex's sister, who is 20 years old with a 2-year-old son and struggling with losing her job, went to H&R Block just because of the advertised RAL on 2/2/09. I had done her previous 2 years of taxes online with TurboTax with no problems and no extra fees. She was told she would get her money in 1-2 days, got this Emerald Card, but she just called me again today (2/19/09) to say that the money still wasn't on her card and that she got a letter in the mail saying that she was denied for the RAL. She told me they charged her over $300 to do her taxes, for a $900 refund, leaving her only around $600! She started school again to try to help her get a degree for a better job and has been in these job search classes, paying for child care while she's there and getting behind on all of her bills, so she really needed that money. I told her to just bring me all of her paperwork, so I can read this contract over and make some calls, but after reading everything online here, I'm really upset! If California can sue H&R Block, then I think every one here needs to contact their local representatives, the BBB, the Consumer Affairs and their State Attorney General and sue them again! I'm contacting everyone and complaining. The economy is HORRIBLE right now and I think this is just a horrible way to take advantage of people. There is too much fine print, too much false advertising, and they are screwing low-income people over who don't really understand all of this jargon like my ex's sister. People need their money that they worked for! I wish everyone else on here luck with their situations, but hey - we have rights and it might take us some time, but we all work hard to earn our money, EIC or not, we deserve some answers and some justice! So I beg everyone - don't just give up the fight - even if you get your money - no one should charge hundreds of dollars to prepare a tax form! That is such a rip off! I have a lot of people come to me every year and I do the TurboTax online with them on my computer and do their taxes and don't charge them anything, even though they try to give me money. My local H&R Block for all of Eastern PA isn't even registered with the BBB, but they still take complaints. Consequences were late on rent, no money for child care, extra fees for making phone calls, inquiries and the cost of filing took 1/3 of the total tax refund!
I opted to receive their emerald card with the 1 to 2 day rapid refund of my income tax return. I received my refund on time however, days after receiving it and after I began using my funds I was doubloe charged on multiple transactions/purchases i made. The money that was taken from me has not been given back to me and the money is still missing. I purchased airline tickets on feb. 5 and two days later H&R block double charged me and placed a hold on the money. It took them 12 days to partially refund my account when their policy states a refund will be honored in 3 to 5 business days. I had to make over 12 hours of phone calls to receive part of this money back. I have filed a complaint, disputes and contacted at least 6 different people at H&R Block all but one person was rude and unhelpful. All but one denied that any money has been taken from me. I'm waiting to hear from their complaint/dispute dept. and one of their clerks. I had to contact the airline agency to have a release form faxed to h&R Block to have the money taken off hold I still havent received approx. 733.00 dollars of double charges which clearly reflect being taken on the automated assistance of my transactions via the telephone voice response service. The internet accessable statement from my account activity does not show these duplicate charges. According to other complaints listed on the internet I am not the only victim. I want mt money back and be refunded the fees they charged to proccess my taxes! We have had our utilities turned off and suffered many other damages because of their theft. I've lost time at work because I've had to fight with H & R block during business hours to try and reinstate these funds. We have had to skip a meal a day so that our food would last. As I have a 4 year old child and my fiancee is a disabled vet. We are currently struggling now due to their theft.
After using H & R Block 7 out of the last 8 years to do our taxes,I will NEVER use or recommend them again! My husband went in on 2/3/09 to file our taxes,they charge him 215.00 to file them plus 29.95 bank fees to get them in 8 to 15 days on one of their Emerald cards. Instead of getting our money,we have gotten the run around-4 different answers from customer service including from the local office, nobody giving us a straight answer on where the money is,and being told that it is 8 to 15 BUSINESS days, not days like they state on their paperwork, their website and they tell you in person in the office. We set up payments for our bills for after the last day H & R Block told us we'd have our money by, to ensure we wouldn't be disconnected or anything, but since they outright lied to us, we are in serious financial trouble. My husband has been our only source of income and he has been laid off since the first week of December. Thanks to the lying thieves at H & R Block, by the time we get what is rightfully due to us, our bank account will have been closed, power and phone shut off and we may lose our home too. We have 4 small children who are having to suffer because of this too. If anyone decides to sue because of them this year, you can count our family in!
SHAME ON YOU REPS OF H&R BLOCK!!! I am a single mom with many health issues. Last year was bad for me financially so in December I went to my local H&R Block office and was approved for a RAL. It was enough to get me by until the end of January when I would be returning to work and have my w-2 to file my taxes. On February 3 my tax agent did my taxes and I asked her what is the quickest way to get my refunds and she said put it on the emerald card you will have it in 2 days. Needless to say it is February 18 and my money is still not available to me. When you call the number on the back of the card and the person on the other side just did not know how to help me and put me on hold. I just hung up. I want my money both federal and state refund and I have no idea how to get it. Next year i do as I have done in past years go to a tax web site and do it myself for free or alot less thatn the $450.00 I paid this year. You will lose alot of business because of your deceitful ways H&R Block. If I do not get my money and soon I will be evicted from my apartment, unable to get medications, seek medical treatment
Like many of the other complaints I've read in the last week I too have been going to H&R Block since 1998 and have always gotten the ral this year same as always my husband I went did our taxes and applied for the 1-2 day check and were told the rest would be direct deposited in 8-10 days. We got the denial on friday for the ral with no explanation we were given the hsbc bank number and we told we didnt meet the criteria and would recieve a denial letter within the next couple of days, still havent recieved that letter. With so many people getting denied the ral you would think that the people doing our taxes would at least tell you that there was the possibilty we would get denied but that was to much like being a good person. I will never use H&R Block again and have told all my family and friends to not go there due to there high prices and the fact that their ripping everyone off who applies for the rapid refund. I only go to H&R Block for that reason. So now here I sit worrying and making myself sick waiting for our federal refund. My husband was laid off of work and we were counting on that money to catch up on our bills. But still no check I am so angry with myself for even going to h&r block had I read all the complaints before hand maybe we would have our refund by now
filed for a measly $193.00 - needed the money right away - was charged $95.00 for filing,$29.95 bank fees was expecting money right away - 14 days later and numerous calls later - finally got $193.00 but H&R block will not waive their fees for supposedly getting my money back Called 14 days later and they said money was on bank card - still not on bank card - they claimed IRS will not give me $ called IRS - they said they don't know what h&r BLOCK IS DOING
Which I would have read all this 1st [complaints] Same deal as everyone else. RAL load on the emerald card. paid for 1-2 day..then told 8-10..We filed on 2/8/09 still nothing on the card. I'm trying to get in touch with the IRS to cancel my check and re-issue another one straight to me, I'll pay HR Block for the filing fee ONLY. I WILL NOT pay for bank charges and fees. Only problem now is getting in touch with the IRS but at least they have only one 800 number, as apposed to HSBc. I've called 3 so far. Fell behind on bills due to this. next I'll file myself for FREE!
Same story. I went to H&R Block and paid them over 400.00 to do my taxes and was told I would get my refund in 1-2 days and then they called me the next day and told me it will now be 8-15 days. I have gone to H&R Block for years but NEVER AGAIN!! My account is minus over 500.00, my cell phone battery went dead, I cannot get another one at a retail dealer because I cant use my ATM card because my account is minus and now have to order one online and will probably get denied on that because I owe my phone carrier money!! This really caused me a huge mess because I beleived them. I now have to wait unit the end of this month but from the sound of things it may be a lot longer. H&R Block really screwed me up!!!! I will never ever go there again!!!
This is about a Complaint that I have with H & R Block, I am a business owner and have had my taxes prepared by H & R for at least 18 years now, although I have had some minor problems with H & R block in the past, I was generally basically satisfied with the overall service that I was afforded with H & R. However, this year on exactly January 19th, 2008 I had an appointment to have my taxes prepared as I always do. When I was finished I was told that I could get my money faster if I got a REFUND ANTICIPATION CHECK? Better know as a RAC?. Not only would I get my IRS refund faster But the fees for H & R block would be deducted and the RAC check would be directly deposited into my bank within 8 to 15 days. Now being that it is a recession, I am a California Contractor and money has been hard to come by lately, this all sounded good. So without hesitation, I signed the RAC agreement and included a copy of a blank check including my Routing number and account number. After waiting 15 days and checking my account starting on the 8th day. Nothing was deposited into my bank. I called my H & R office, on 02/09/09 15 Business days later, and was told by a Manager Named Jan R, she told me she would check on it and get back to me. After waiting 2 days on 02/11/09 I was told by Mrs. R that she was having trouble with contacting HSBC, I told her that I too was trying to contact them and was placed on hold for 45 min. and had to leave to pick up my kids from school. Mrs. R said she would keep trying and call me back. I was working and was told by Mrs. R on 02/12/09 that I should just wait a few more days, that maybe the check might be Deposited over the weekend. During the weekend of 02/14/09 through 02/16/09 which was the Valentines and Washingtons birthdays A "4" Day weekend? I had finally gotten a hold of the IRS on their Wheres my refund check? website. It stated that my check was deposited into HSBCs checking account on Jan 30th of 2009. Only 9 Days from the date I filed. I also finally got a hold of a Customer service person named Ryan at HSBC, who told me that HSBC tried to deposit my check on the date of 02/03/09 and could not deposit it so they sent it back to the IRS. On 02/05/09 and that was that period I was given no other details, explanations or apologies. On the date of 02/17/09 I called the H & R block District office located in Upland Ca. I talked to Mrs. Michele O who was the Office Manager; she seamed to be very concerned and asked me to come in and we would get to the bottom of it. Our appointment was at 1:00 pm so it was around 10:30 am I thought I would try and Call the IRS and see if they could help me, After about an hour or so I was able to talk to a Mrs. B she was very Matter affect? and said The IRS only did what it was supposed to do with the money and that was to Deposit it into HSBC bank and that was done, and even though HSBC said that it was returned to the IRS and it had now been 9 business days there was nothing that I could do to get my money back. At 1:00 pm on 02/17/09 I arrived at the H & R office in Upland, Ca. and talked to Mrs. Michele O, She had called the IRS and oddly enough, she had the same person on the phone that I had talked to an hour previously a Mrs. B. Again Mrs. B in her very Mater a fact? voice said that the best she could do is put a trace on my check, and that would take 6 to 10 weeks at the earliest. So Mrs. Michele O said that that was all she could do. So my American people, the hard fact is Im screwed my IRS refund check is in the Twilight zone? my payments are late, H & R Block is now demanding there money and I do not have a answer. I do know however that, had I truly been informed about the process and repercussions of this so called Refund Anticipation loan? and had H & R block been upfront about the crap that I would have to go through waiting 10 weeks extra above their 8 to 15 days a total of about 4 months until I even remotely will know anything about my IRS refund check. Its just inconceivable the amount of trickle down financial hardship that will be bestowed upon me, that in my wildest possible nightmare scenarios, I could not have even remotely comprehended the outcome on the day I did my Taxes at H & R block. And it is now my personal quest to tell every one about the injustice of (REFUND ANTICAPATION LOANS) (H & R Block) and (HSBC) DONT DO IT, DONT GO TO H & R BLOCK AND DONT GO TO HSBC.
I chose the 8-13 day RAL and had to pay over $300 for it on 2/2/09 I should have already had my money and now being told I won't get it until MARCH 2, 2009. I paid for a service and signed a contract for the loan and think a class action lawsuit for anyone not receiving their funds by specified date. HR Block misled me to believe that I didn't have to wait for the funds to be deposited by IRS to receive MY money in that short of time. If they wait for the money from IRS to be deposited to HSBC, then give us the money, there is no loan to it. No food, 5 month old in house still waiting on refund so electricity won't be turned off. The car loan that was to be paid off if now in repo status due to the payment not being made at the time set up with account specialist, was set up for Feb 17th. (The first date given to me about when my refund would be available)$20 in gas and 4 hours waiting at the IRS office with NO BATHROOM to be told HSBC didn't really loan the money just wait for the money to be deposited to them, then pay the fees out of it. $40 in babysitting fees for time in office, Luckily I am now unemployed so at least I didn't miss a day of pay to sit there.
Like everyone else here, I went to H&R block to file our Taxes. I did not expect a refund because of our higher income but Brad (18 years experience) told me that we were going to get money back. Quite a large amount. So, he ran down the list of options on how I want my refund. I took the RAL (1-2 days), the computer said we were approved by HSBC. I settled for the almost $500 in fees and services i guess b/c I wanted our money now... Anyhow, we filed on the 14th of Feb. but have not received a dime. I called H&R Block but of course they can't tell you ANYTHING. I called the 866 number to find out but they know nothing either. Then I went on the IRS web-site and they were SORRY for the denial and were unable to answer any questions. Our money, that we are forced to entrust others with, is missing? held up? lost? I did find out that we still have to pay HSBC all the fee's, regardless of if we got the rapid refund or not. Total rip-off. NEVER again will I file rapid refund. The fees are not worth it. And you most likely will not get what you paid for. I guess the thing that gets me so upset is that no one know anything. You just get a run around and headache. Although I did not count on this money and I am not behind in anything, (I do feel for everyone that is)I stress over the not knowing WHERE is our money that WE worked for.
First email:2/3/08 I have at my desk a very annoyed client who got an Emerald Advance in December 2007. She is receiving calls and a letter stating that she owes a balance due. She has paid it over, but continues to receive a balance due letter. She has tried more than numerous times to call the 866#, but is on hold or gets no help. She wants an answer and she wants it now. Please help her. I don't know what to do. second email:2/15/08 Hello Sonny - I have left you 5 VM and have not heard back could someone please contact me asap as the man John N from H&R messed up my card payments and I paid off the card via the 866 # in aug of 2008. I believe my payment was put on an incorrect account number. THis is effecting my credit. I have copy of my balance transfer in Aug. I put the payment on my credit card for the complete balance. When should I hear from you or someone? I call the card number and NO ONE answers ever. PLEASE HELP! third email: Hello Sonny: To recap our conversation. The case has been sent for tier 3 investigation as the balance still appears on the account number associated with my name. The expected time frame is 24-48 hours making Thursday February 19th 2009 a realistic return call date. Tonight's phone call lasted 1 hour and 19 mins and ran the gamut of there is no balance involving my name to their is a balance involving my name. Can you see why having a third party listening is in the customers best interest? Do you still find me impatient? Or maybe dissatisfied customer would be the more appropriate way to describe your customers Mr. S?
I filed my w-2s on 1/31/09 I used 1-2 day refund. payed out extra money so I could get a quick return, I called the # they gave me for the emerald card there was something wrong with my claim, after another trip an bunch of phone calls I found out they put my name in wrong using my last name first so they fix it no big deal I think; I wait still nothing I call asking questions they tell me anything to get me out of there, I wait a couple more days still nothing, now i called every # avaible to find out what was going on. they tell me nothing. wait until 8-15days. it should be there. well today is 15 days. I got my state refund on the card but no federal money, Ive never got my state before federal. Then they took all but I think 93$ some odd cents out $325 then charge me for trying to get money off the card an failing so it left me $83/ I reread the contract over an over saying my money would of been there by the 2/12 09. here it the 15th cant get an answer. still same old story with the run around. where does it stop. there all these complaints on here an I want to know whats being done about it!
I filed my taxes at Highway Robbery Block on 2/11/09. I selected 1-2 day RAL. I checked the HSBC website on the 2/12, and was informed that my RAL had been denied. Of course the tax preparer had her head up her a$$, and seemed to be a bit unnerved as I took my sweet time reading the fine print on the yellow paper. IRS has confirmed reciept of my return, and has since informed me that I will recieve my Federal return by 2/24. Will I be charged for the 1-2 day RAL? From what I see on this website, I will. It is important that I tell people that if you owe credit cards, loans (student and otherwise), owe the IRS, owe your state, child support etc., HSBC WILL deduct the amounts you owe from your expected return. They even say it on the yellow paper. (We will act as a debt collector...) If you owe money, DONT USE H&R BLOCK.
First off let me state the i have read alot of peoples complaints and they never come back and update what has happened. Please Update that is how infomation is shared and sometimes what people can expect to happen to them. In December 2008 I got a letter from the Irs stating that I had someone send them a W-2 that I didnt report. And that I owed more taxes. They gave me 30days to get back with them. I then called and got a 30 day extention. Well that went by and I called back and asked for another extention and the guy said he could nt give me another extention that they would send me a letter stating that I had 90 days to address this and they wouldnt touch my 2008 refund for the yr 2009 filing season. Well I filed my taxes on Feb 3 before 2pm and it was accepted by the Irs but stated that they have delayed my refund because I had a prior year obligation. Well I called the 1800 and they gave me another number to call and it was for my state tax department. I called them and they said that I owed them $159.73 and that they requested the IRS to take it. Well I was due a state refund of $140.00. I said fine when will i recieve my refund. They stated they didnt know. I called HR Block and they said they didnt know when I would get it that I should recieve it Feb 13. Or Feb 20. Remember I did the Rapid Refund Loan Check 1-2 days fees were $436.06 to have the taxes filed and to get the loan. Well I checked the Irs web site and it had that I would recieve my money by Feb 17 then changed to Feb 24. I then called and talked to H&R and the manager still didnt know when I would recieve my money. So I called back and taked to the IRS again and the lady said that I wouldnt recieve my refund anytime soon because of my 2007 tax debt that I had with them and what I owed the state. Which is about $1600.00 dollars and I still will get a refund but not this month. Now I still have not got the certified letter from the IRS telling me that I had 90 days to take care of my 2007 taxes. She the lady at the IRS stated that they were probley going to take what I owed them. Plus send the state what they requested. Called H&R block and the lady that answered the phone stated that my refund wasnt there on Feb 13 and that they would call me. I then asked her if it was better for them to call me she said yes and was rude through the whole call. I explained that I paid over 400.00 and it was my right to call. She got even ruder and was hanging up the phone called me a !#%. So as a result I paid H&R BLock and the Irs is taking what they say I owe them Which is not all correct, I have to pay H&R block again to redo my 2007 taxes to add some of the income in. I also have to pay 2x the state debt because they are taking my refund due and the IRS is going to send them money as well. Then they will send my my money that they owe me. And still no word on when I can get my refund due after all is paid for. All H&R will tell me is that it will be 8-15 days. The IRS told me that is not true because they dont tell them that. We have used H&R for 16 yrs never denied the loan, never been treated so rude. Will never use them again. The only thing that I can think of is the reason that people cant get there money from the govermnent is because they have not printed it yet, meaning that they dont have it.
My husband and I had our taxes done by H&R Block on Jan 30th. We went with the 1 - 2 Day RAL Loan and was denied. They told us it would be 8 to 15 days, but we would get a bigger refund. We checked with the IRS, and our refund was direct deposited on Feb 13th, but not applied to our Emerald Card. When we call the number on the back of the card, to find out what is going on, we get told different things. He was told By Midnight February 15th I was told midnight the 14th. I called them back at 12:16 AM and talked to a woman who would not speak to me, had to be my husband. he gave her all the information she asked for, card info, address and social security number. When he asked when to expect the refund ot be applied, she put him on hold. We sat on hold for 66 minutes and 3 seconds, taking turns holding the phone until we checked our balance online and noticed that they had charged us for the call, but never came back to the phone. I hung up and called again, only to find out that the office was closed. We had been put on hold so that woman could go home without having to answer any questions about why the IRS says our money has been deposited, but they have not applied it to the card so that we could access our refund. This is the worst service we had ever gotten anywhere and will not be referring any of our friends, family or co-workers to H & R Block. I plan to wait til Midnight tomorrow and find out what happens then. But like many people, we really counted ont hat money to pay rent and bills. Just am so irritated that a company can hold your money like this without any explanation. Come Tuesday, February 17th, we will be without lights, water, phone or a home. We are already without heat since we had counted on the money being here already to buy more fuel. We will be homeless.
I filed my taxes with H&R Block on the 2nd and used rapid refund. I was told I would recieve my refund the next day and was charged almost $300 for this service. I recieved a phone call the next morning stating I would not recieve my refund that day and was given a phone number to call to find out why. The phone number was an automated recording that wanted me to go to a website that couldn't tell me anything either. I finally spoke to a real person on the 888 number and was told I would recieve my refund by 9 am on the 13th. I called H&R block on the 13th after I had not heard anything and they told me they had not recieved my refund. I called the 888 number again and it said that they had not recieved my refund and that payments were only recieved on Fridays to check back next Friday. I called the IRS website to find out what was going on with my refund. The lady at the IRS was awesome and was really nice told me not only did H&R Block have my money but they have had it for a while now. She also gave me the routing number and the account number that my refund was placed in. I can't wait to call H&R Block in the morning Because I am tired of all thier I don't know anything crap because now I know they are rip offs. I just don't know what I am going to say when they try to tell me that they still don't have my money or something like they aren't giving it to me until next friday while they sit and draw interest on my money and charging me almost $300 to use my money to collect interest on without even sharing some of that interest with me. Not only that but the lady at the IRS told me that she recieves a ton of calls everyday from people that used H&R Block and each time the IRS has sent the money but H&R Block isn't disbursing the money I filed the rapid refund because I had lost my job and I was behind in all my bills I had an eviction notice, water shut off notice, power shut off notice, and my baby needed diapers on top of it all. I could have filed online for free and got it faster than this, and now I still have to pay a ridiculous fee. Thanks alot H&R Block.
I was reading some of the complaints earlier but wanted to mention that I had a great experience with HR Block because the person, Terry, explained to me that the RAL and Instant RAL are loans against my taxes and that I'd have to apply for them, that there's a small credit check and if I don't owe the IRS or my State DOR or HSBC bank then it's normally fine. But if I do owe any of them (and I did) that the loan would be delayed. He also said if the 1-2 day is delayed that I'm not charged for the extra fee, and he was right because I was delayed and not charged the extra fees. I thought my tax prep would be about 90-100 but it was around $140 and he showed me the billing breakdown. The earned income credit form for my 2 kids was about $35 for just that (but it was worth it to get a couple grand). He showed me I pay for each form I needed for my taxes and asked if I had a coupon from the paper or my employer. I said no and he said Well you work at wal mart and I have a coupon code for that and it will save you $15. So he saved me $15. So, I can see why some of you all had challenges because you didn't understand a loan, but it is a loan against your taxes. I had a good honest experience.
My taxes were prepaired and I was given the Emerald Card for fund to be deposited within a max time of 8-15 days. It is now days past the limmit and I am still not payed. They did not meet the stated time frame. I was lead to belive that the new card was the fastest way and I budgeted my money around that belief. I have missed a doctor's appointment that is vital to my health, because I was unable to pay for the trip. My bills have went over the date due and I am now resposible for the interest. My groceries are running thin and I am agrivated to no end. I am diagnosed with PTSD and this makes my condition worse.
My fiance went to H&R Block to have his taxes done and receive a rapid refund, as we have in previous years, but this year we were denied? I could have done his taxes online for free; or little cost, and had our taxes in the same amount of time that we paid $290.00 plus to H&R Block to receive them. I think our fees actually came out to around 400.00 for a basic file with head of household and dependants. I think it is terrible for them to offer this loan to all these customers who have always received them, charge those customers fees they'd only pay because of the rapid refund - then deny them. It's a money scam in my opinion. Who pays that much to file taxes? Honestly! We/he will never again use H&R Block for any tax services. The only damage is the bills that need to be paid. Because he in the past 9 years has never been denied rapid refund we assumed this year would be the same and spent accordingly. Obviously we should not have, but after 9 years of rapid refunds - why would we assume that we would not receive it this year. Plus, the almost 400.00 it cost us to e-file, when I could have done it online for free. And the fees everytime we use the emerald card; vs. having the refund directly deposited into his bank.
My husband and I went back to H&R Block this year (we have been for three years in a row) We have never had a problem getting an RAL but for some reason this year we were denied. When we called b/c when we were in the branch office we were told we were approved, they just kept telling us that they would call us no need to call them. YEAH RIGHT! I want to know where my money is! We paid $305 to have our taxes filed. What a rip off. We got our taxes filed on Feb 4th and we were told they would be here by today (feb 13th) we called three times today and Nothing...no explanation. My husband finally asked to speak to the tax preparer and she had mentioned that she did not know why but they should be here next friday now. She also said she did not know how much. I will NEVER use H&R Block again! Not only that but i will telling everyone i know not to use them as well. We are facing eviction now b/c we made false Payment arrangments based on their promises. We are facing eviction now due to false payment arrangments on our rent.
On the 28th of January 2009, my husband and I went into the local H&R Block. We decided to do the RAL, and we understood that it would take at least 1 to 2 days. No problem right? Well the next day I call thier 1-800 number and guess what it was denied. So we call back to H&R block, and we were told they have nothing to do with it that we must call the treasury dep., so we did and they said it would be 8-15 days. We have waited our 8-15 days and still nothing. We moved from Texas to Colorado and we needed the money to pay for expenses my aunt had to loan us some money to make it until the irs check comes. Dont use H&R Block for any of your taxes. And dont try to get answers with them because they have no idea what theyre doing. We are broke and have no money to buy another car so we can look for jobs. My rent is paid but I dont know for how long.
This is in no way a complaint. I've read several comments on here asking if someone actually exists who REALLY got approved for a loan with H&R Block. The answer is YES! I have went to H&R for the past 4 years and yet to have a problem. I receive instant money (and no, my credit is not great!) with no problem. I receive mine in a check form, I'd rather pay the extra $20 for a check than have to take it off a card. My best friend also went there this year and got her instant refund on the Emerald Card. She doesn't have the best credit either, yet she got approved. Money was there when they said it would be there, and no hidden fees for taking money off it. I don't know what is going on with the offices you people are going to, but you shouldn't slanderize the ENTIRE H&R Block company when the office you visited screwed you! If you have a complaint about a particular office, go ahead, but don't do that to the entire company.
Basically I was used. By my own admission I, due to laziness and a lack of patience, used a tax preparer to process my return. The same company I used last year, but new representative. Last season I allowed myself to be duped into the fast loan which I paid a large amount of my return for a "quick anticipation LOAN". I opted this time for the regular anticipation "LOAN" due to my laziness. Well as the time has flown bye waiting for my return "LOAN" I decided to track my return. I looked back at last years and discovered my "Anticipation LOAN" was just a farce.I would have received the same check at the same time e-filing myself. I will never use one of these organizations again as e-filing is free and the return comes the same time. I am ashamed of myself for allowing this to happen. I will for the entire next year of my existence fight with every means of propaganda that is available to me these profiteers with reckless abandon for their exploitation of the masses. Do Not Use a Tax service.
Went to H&R Block for the Ral Loan. We were denied. We have good credit. I have read everyones comments about this situation, and it is awful. I like everyone else need the money, that is why we payed the fees. Rediculous. Called all the numbers, got treated terribble. Isn't this our money? I just can't believe it. It should be jail time for ripping us all off! We need a class action suit for pain and suffering also. Everyone is stressing out, becasue this is are chance to get caught up on things, usually temporary and we cant even do that with are own money. Will never go to H&R block again. Never!
My husband and I recieved a letter from H&R Block stating that if we filed before Feb.12th,09. We were approved for our RAL,we have never been denied, but were on Feb.3rd 2009. When we asked why they gave us a phone number to call the bank, HSBC, because H&R Block isn't the lending institution. I called HSBC and am getting the run around. I call one number and they refer me to another number. Finally saying they will send us a letter of denial, they can't discuss it over the phone. H&R Block charged us $570.00 for tax preparation, if I'd have known that I would have filed myself. Both companies are scamming innocent customers and putting it off on the other company. How is this legal?
I have been with H&H block forever but know i don't think I will again. They have stoled my hard earn money that i work hard for and th only thing they could tell me is that they were sorry its a glich in there system than turn around and took more and no one will tell me why. H&R Block does not stand bye what they do. I will exsplain better when i talk with some than can help me. Its been one headace and not beable to sleep and hours of my time on the phone and worrier ever day. are they gona take more. i cant even get me a car or a house because i dont know if my money will be gone. not be able to spent my taxes on my child or anything do to this stuff they keep doing this to.
I filed my taxes on January 16th 2009. I was told that I would have my returns put on my Emerald Card within 2 days. Well on the 18th of Janary 2009 there was a balance of $0.00 dollars on the card so I decided to give H&R Block a call to see what was going on, come to find out the loan was denied by the H&R Block bank due to reasons still unknown. I received confirmation on the 21st of January through text message saying that the IRS accepted my return and it would take 8-15 day for the IRS to send out the return and that it would take that long for it to be on the Emerald Card. Frustrated I decided to give H&R Block yet another call to ask why they couldn't tell me this in the first place and that if I had known this bull**** was going to happen that I would have filed my taxes through Turbo-Tax or through some other avenue. They continued to give me the run around and had pretty much no answer to any of my questions. Finally on the 3rd of February my state taxes was credited to my Emerald Card and on the 6th of February my federal taxes were credited to my Emerald Card, again had I known this bull**** was going to happen in this first place I would have gone through some other source to have my taxes prepared. Now to top it all of I was short changed about $400.00 dollars on my state return and when I asked H&R Block what the problem was they told me that I would have to notify the H&R Block bank to resolve this matter. Well I called them and asked them to explain why I was missing close to $400.00 dollars on my state return and they told me that I had to take this matter up with the IRS because it wasn't their problem. I still havn't been credited the missing money to my account and am waiting on some answers from H&R Block's bank. I strongly recommend that if you plan on getting your taxes prepared that you get them done through another source other than H&R Block. They don't know what they are doing and have no answers to a majority of your questions.
I took my dad to a H&R Block office to file his taxes for the first time with H&R Block. I just wanted an estimate of what he could get in return. After the lady said it was like $260.00 to have them prepare the taxes, I said no lets go somewhere else. But my dad insist he wanted to file with them although they were so expensive. The next day we went back to a H&R Block down the street from my job and we were assisted by another man who spoke spanish which i was glad because that way I didn't have to transalate to my dad everything he said. At the end we had him prepare the taxes. He gave my dad a Mastercard Emerald Card. I asked him several times if there was more fees with that card he said NO is FREE. I asked him again, if i take all the money out is there a fee? He said NO is FREE. On Sunday we go to the bank to cash advance the money of the card and we come to find out every time you do a cash advance on the card is another $20 fee. I was furious because he still has more money coming into the card from last years stimulus package he was not entitled to due to him not filing for 2007. So that means is an additional $40 in hidden fees. I honestly think there a rip off and there customer service is horrible. The manager of the office was less knowlegable than my self and did not assist me like he should off. Every year i was preparing my taxes with hispanic little offices that only charge me $30.00 and i have not had a problem with the IRS and I was happy and save lots more money.
I came in with my taxrs already prepared, but I wanted to apply for a money now loan. They said that they could not copy off of my tax forms and put it in their computer, so I let them prepare them again. I had a couple of w-2 forms, but I also needed a Schedule C form. The lady did not know hoe to do that. She had to ask a few people for help. She kept making errors on forms. I asked her if that was going to make mt bill higher? She said, no. I informed her that I wanted to pay my loan back from November, and needed a 1-2 day loan. She said , no problem. Like everyone else, I was approved for the 1-2 day loan, and "surprise" I did not get it. I called, but they told me that same thing as everyonr rlse. The bank denied my loan. I have also dealth with them for years! My bill ended up being 481.00! On top of that, I am paying a huge fee for the 500.00 they loaned me in Nov. I misplaced mt Emrald Card. I called to get it cancelled. I asked for them to rush the card to me for 35.00. They said okay. This was 2/4/09. Today is 2/11/09. Surprise! I have not even recieved my rush delivery card! I am so mad! I have heard people mention a class action lawsuit. Email me if you are interested.
Well this would be my first time claiming my son and as head of household. I go into H&R Block on 1/16/09 to sign up for the RAL so I would get the quick cash fast. WRONG! Had I known it was based on my credit aprroval I would'nt of done it. Of course I was denied and informed I would receive my funds on a later date. I call HSBC and they said a red flag came up and couldnt give me any questions to answer and said contact the IRS because they are holding your funds. I contact them and the gentleman said everything was ok they just had to confirm my son's ss# and confirm that I was his mother and said the only hold up was because this was my first time claiming him ever on my return, normally his father (which we are not married) claims him. The IRS said I would have my funds direct deposited no later than Feb 10th! I'm waiting and waiting. My Emerald card still reads $0.00. I then contact my State return and their online site reads Your funds were deposited on 1/23! I found this out on 2/3. So there for I found out that HSBC returned the funds and I will get a paper check from State in 5-15days. The IRS, I call them again and the lady stated my funds were deposited on 2/6. HSBC DID SOMETHING TO MY FUNDS. WHEN I TRY CALLING THEM I GET HUNG UP OR ON HOLD FOR HOURS. I don't owe anyone anything. I dont have a current bank accoun.t I dont' know what is going on. Im a single Mother and our eviction has been scheduled. I'm working with other family members now to help me through all of this. NEVER AGAIN!
I have been going to hr block for the past few yrs. never had a problem I always get the ral loan. This year my husband went and got approved for the advance then went back and filed they took that out and their fees we have the emerald card half of out money went on right away like they said it would. Then we were supposed to get the next half in 1 to 2 days. It was not there so i waited a week and called they said you were denied. I was never denied before nothing has changed with us. That doesn't make any sense how did we get the first half not the second half and how did we get the instant advance makes no sense. Then they asked do you owe the irs money no we called the treasury dep and they say we owe nothing. Well you have to wait the 8-15 days. Did that happen to anyone else? What did i pay for then [they] charge extra for that service to get it in a hurry said we were approved then all the sudden we don't get the second half of our money.
I was told that i would receive a refund loan with 1-2 days. they rep was very detailed about most of the services, but i think very conveniently excluded that the refund was not guaranteed, even provided by them. I would assume that since there are so many complaints about this misunderstanding that HR block would inform people about there ability(or lack thereof) to truly provide this money. i made no alternate plans to pay my rent and am in danger of being evicted.
My wife and I filed our taxes with H&R Block as we have done so in the past without any issues. However this time we filed Feb. 5th and paid plenty of fees to have a portion of our money in one to two days. When our check was not at the office they had told me that the bank denied the loan. I'm quite confused you see because I didn't realize I was borrowig my own money. Today is now Feb. 10th and they say (H&R Block) that the money will be here on the 13th. But according to the IRS my refund won't be here until the 24th. And who wants their credit ran. So here I am wondering why we went to H&R Block to get my money a little faster to catch up on bills. But instead we paid an extra 200.0 dollars to sit and wait anyway. Well live and learn because that is the last time H&R Block will scam us again. I hope they enjoy this years money because they are not getting any more out of us from here on out. I have a big feeling that we are not the only ones who feel this way. My bills are all overdue thanks to waiting.
For the past several years I have gone on line to do my income tax. This year I needed my refund earlier. I am behind in my house payment. It was suggested to use H&R Block, since I could get an instant loan. I called on Tuesday, January 27th and spoke with Bill. We talke for a while I explained what I needed we talked about cost he said in the ballpark of $140.00. I was not too happy but if I could be the loan to pay my house payment I would be happy. Nothing was ever said to me about I may not get a loan. On Saturday, January 31st I had a 9:00 am. Everything went fine, Carmen was very nice and helpful. Again nothing was said about me not getting a loan. Just sign here, here, here, here, and here. No time to read the very small print. Later at home I read the FINE print...the charges are out right highway robbery. $202.00 for doing the taxes (this was a simple return with 1 daughter as a dependent), 35.981 percent for the loan, which I never received, $29.95 for using Emerald Card, the charges for just using the card horrible. I was furious, my blood pressure went sky high over the amounts I was being charged. The problem started on Sunday morning when I was told over the phone by a computer voice I could not have the loan. I was to call this number, 866-297-4600. I called she referred me back to the office that handled my taxes. I called the H&R Block I dealt with on the day before. I spoke with Gwen, Carmen was off. Gwen said she was sorry there was nothing they could do, it was the bank's decision. Funny thing I have only one credit card and it is with HSBC, this is the bank giving loans. On Monday, February 2nd, I went on line to do my two daughters' returns. The scheduled date they were to get their returns was the same day as mine, February 13th. I get to work this morning, February 10th, guess what...their money is now in my checking account. Can I find out about my return? No! I will be calling later to after 9:00 am to find who I can call. Other then the fact I was not given all the facts about getting a loan, plus the cost of the Emerald Card. I will NEVER use H&R Block again, I will NEVER send anyone there, plus I will NEVER recommend anyone to them either. I have voiced my opionion to several people. I think something needs to be done. Let people know what H&R Block is doing to thier clients. I know in the future I will read the fine print before I sign. Thank you for listening to me.
Used them last two years and had trouble in 2007 getting any further money added to Emerald card once initial rapid loan done. Numerous excuses used and never able to speak to anyone who could give definitive answers as to why. In 2008 vowed not to use them and then was presented with an emergency where I did not believe I would have any more work as boss passed away so needed money to live on so felt forced to return to H&R Block for fast cash. I paid more this year for preparation of return and then was fast talked into paying $300 more to receive my refund in 1-2 days. I filed my return on 2/4 and today 2/10 still do not have my refund. I have spent two days on the telephone trying to get this resolved and have now been told that I will have to wait until 2/23 to get my refund as my wife owes $137 for a lien which we knew nothing about. I have tried on numerous phone calls to get a refund of my $300 at least which I paid for rapid return of refund to no avail. I will most definitely not step foot in another H&R Block office no matter what the circumstances as I cannot afford to be ripped off again by people who have no idea what they are doing, know nothing about tax laws and deductions other than what computer tells them and I feel are not hiring qualified people to do returns. I feel they are just taking advantage of poor people who are in need of extra money at a hard time in their lives with no concern for the damage they are causing to other people's lives. I am now behind on my rent, had to borrow money to feed my children, had a car ready for me to put a down payment on which I lost due to no quick refund, and have been unable to get an abscessed tooth pulled as a result of this companies bad business practice.
My husband and I went to H&R Block to have our taxes done as we had done for the past 3 years before. We left that evening with our taxes completed and an Emerald card that the refund was to be deposited on. That evening the card was lost and we immediately called to report it. We were advised by the staff at the local office to call the 866 number on the back of the card (they provided us with the number). We called and the 'tier 1' representative advised us that our taxes had not been transmitted yet and that the local office could issue us another card. So, we went back down and told them of our findings. The manager in charge there passed us off onto a preparer who from the start stated she did not know what to do in this case. She tried and did her best. She issued us another card and we left assuming we would have our refund the next day. We too had paid the fees for the preparation and 2 day refund. It has been 10 days and have been told so many different stories and instructions. No one will pass us to a supervisor nor will they be consistent in the protocol. My husband is the only person they will speak to, even though my name is on the taxes. I don't know if we will ever receive our money but I do know that this is my last experience with this company. We filled out a transfer paper to send the funds to our bank account but was quickly told this was the wrong way to go and a stop was put on this transaction. It was then stated that the funds would be transfered from the lost card to the new card we had in our possession. So, we waited another 2 days and still no refund. My husband called again and waited 20 minutes to speak with someone who thought they knew what was going on. This person said they would expedite a new card out right away. That was 5 days ago. We called them this afternoon and they did not have a tracking number for us. They stated that a card had not been sent out and that they would have the tracking information in the morning at 7:15. I called the original office to speak with the manager, who of course, was not in. I expressed that tomorrow afternoon I would be filing a formal complaint if I did not receive our refund. I was told that the district manager would contact me but have yet to hear from anyone. I tried to go to another office thinking they may know what to do. The women was very nice but did not have any answers, and again, no manager on duty or to contact. My husband and I are very ready to pursue other avenues for collecting our refund and the fees we paid for the service. I just don't know what the next step would be. Since this has started, I have had severe anxiety attacks. I have been prescribed medicine by my physician. I continue to plead with the employees at this company to help us find a solution and to issue our money. But it has done no good. We are behind on several of our bills and now have one vehicle (we were using the refund to have it fixed).
I was told I would definitely get my refund money in 1-2 days.I was not told they would run a credit check.They have always loaned it with your refund as collateral.Now this lady at HSBC says they deposit the money on your card when they get the money from the IRS. I asked her how that was a loan and why I was being charged interest.She just got hostile with me.I just want my 400 dollars back from H&R Block.What a Scam!!I can actually do my own taxes . I paid to get them back faster due to a financial emergency.
My partner and I went in for our annual tax refund RAL which we get every year. We get this loan every year with no issues and have for about 10 years. This year we were denied the 1-2 day loan and are having to wait the standard 8-15 days. I have recently found out this is because the bank they go thru HSBC has started running credit checks on these loans. This is fine, but we were not notified of this credit check prior to using them. Had we been, we wouldve opted to electronically file online for free and get the refund in the same timeframe. She qualifies for all the EIC and gets a substantial amount each year that we count on each year to catch up on bills and so on. I believe that something has changed in their policy, or the bank that they use then this should be advised prior to filing for those of us that couldve saved the 300.00 to get the money in the same timeframe. 250.00-300.00 in tax preperation fees for something we couldve done online for free if we had known the RAL was based on credit this year. Also several bills have gone delinquent since we made payment arrangements to pay within 2-3 days of filing that now cannot be met.
On January 18, 2009 I went to an H&R Block office to file my tax returns as I have done for the past 8 years. I tried to save money this year and do my taxes online with H&R Block which would have only cost me $49.99 but their software was not up to date and did not have the First Time Home Buyers Credit form online. I decided to just stop and goto the branch to get the form but was told that they would have to do it there. This would cost me an additional $373.00. The lady started to put my information in and noticed that it was all done for her because I had already done it online. This made it incredibly simple for the lady as she just had to fill the First Time Home Buyers form out. The whole process didn't take more than 15 minutes. As always, I decided to do the Instant Refund Anticipation Loan. This year my returns were to be much higher due to purchasing my first home in 2008 and the First Time Home Buyers Credit which made my returns $10051.00. The preparer told me that I couldn't do the instant loan because I was declined. This was news to me as I carry a 793 credit score and my credit is near perfect. She then told me that I could do the 1-2 day loan and I elected for that due to no other choice. She also said that it would be deposited on the little green card within 24 hours. 2 days later no payment was made to the card so I decided to make some calls. I was forwarded to HSBC and told that my application was denied due to identity problems. They then put me through a series of questions to answer to validate my identity. The questions that they asked me had absolutely nothing to do with me and there was no way I could answer them. They then told me that I failed the identification test and my refund would not be accepted by HSBC. This was January 20. They told me that I my refund would just be deposited directly to the green card in 8-15 days. February 2, 2009 I checked the card one last time before making more calls to find out where this large amount of money could be and I was told by HSBC that the money was direct deposited on January 30, 2009 but that they could not release it to me. They said that it would have to be returned to the IRS and that they would have to hold it for up to 2 weeks before they could return it. This morning February 9, 2009 I called again and was told the money had been returned to the IRS. I then called the IRS and they told me that the money would take an additional 2 weeks for them to be able to release it and at that point would take and additional 4 weeks for me to receive a paper check. So I'm now having to wait an additional 6 weeks for the money. I called the H&R Block district manager and he told me that he couldn't do anything and that I would still have to pay the 423.00 that is due for them doing my taxes. The biggest problem I have is that my identity was confirmed in the H&R branch when I had to give all identification to the tax lady to even apply for the loan in the first place. Also, the bank had ample enough time to reject the funds and have the IRS simply send the money directly to me instead of incurring this additional 8 weeks. I will say that after all these years of service from H&R Block that I will never do business with them again.
I went into H&R Block on 1/26/2009 to file my taxes and I have yet heard anything back from anybody about why I haven't received my refund. They keep giving me the run around at H&R Block. I was initially told that I was approved for the 1-2 day loan. That never happened. Then I was told I would have my refund by the 6th. That of course never happened.(I had looked it up on the computer and it also said the same thing.6th) Before the 6th got here they changed it to the 10th. The 10th haven't gotten here yet and now it say the 24th. Could somebody please tell me what's going on? I have had run-around after run-around after run-around and still no answers.There should be something that we can do about this situation. I know this scam has got to be against the law. If I as an American Citizen or any other American Citizen were scamming people out of there money I or anybody else would be facing time in jail. This is an outright scam and should not be allowed to happen to hard working people, especially when we are already working on these under-paid jobs. I have to wait a month for my tax return? (That's if they don't change the date again) We need to start a class action lawsuit and make them (H&R Block) pay us back for all these costly fees they has scammed out of us. They are still lying to people who are filing their taxes. People have been filing their taxes since the first filing day for this tax season, which has been almost a month ago, which is plenty of time for them to have warned people about this matter. They are still lying to people and scamming with their costly fees knowing that they are not going to get their taxes when promised. THIS IS UNJUST.
Filed taxes with H&R Block. Got Emerald card in office. Called to check to be told I was denied the rapid refund and it would be 8-15 days. Call again and told that it would be on 6 Feb 09. Told by another H&R rep that it was not in the batch and would be on by the 7th. IRS site say deposited on 3 Feb 09. State says it was sent 29 Feb. Who can we file the law suit with and how soon. I have talked to a total of 5 representatives and gotten a different answer from each. The las one stated you will definitely get your refund, but we have to wait until we receive the money from the IRS. (what was 3 Feb 09) I sent a letter to the O'bama system and would like for more than just a lawsuit. They did that in California and these people just moved to another scam. We need consumer bailout as well as reinbursemnt. Where is out law to protect the consumer. It has put many plans on hold including being able to purchase the ticket to bring my fiancee home after we have worked on it for 2 years and waited for 5 months to get the approval.
I too was taken for a horrible ride from Block. I even asked our tax preparer since we werent qualified for the instant what the difference was with the 1-2 day. She said she wasnt sure but almost everyone gets the 1-2 day. I said so we will have it in 1-2 days then for sure. She replied with yes. It has now been 5 business days...and nothing. I checked the IRS website and it said our retun was excepted and will have our refund by Feb 17. Doesnt the IRS deposit on fridays? SO does this now mean it will be deposited to our emerald card( hsbc) the bank who denied us however is still getting the check...then distrubuted to me when they feel like it. Im so mad about all of this. Ive done my own taxes for years online with Taxact and never had these issues. We were late on our rent due to this and our water bill. I was going to pay for my daughters birthday party the day we were suppose to get our money too, and now that is put off.
I went on Sunday, Feb 1st and filed my taxes. I needed the money to help pay some of my Mom's hospital bills. I told the lady that I wanted my money quick. She told me I could get a check the next day. I asked if they would run my credit for that and she said yes. I told her no because my credit is bad and I knew that they wouldn't approve me. I asked about the next 1 which was the 1 to 2 day. She didn't inform me that they would check my credit all she said that if I didn't owe any money to the IRS that I would have the money in that period of time. I paid almost $400 for that. She suggested that I put my refund on their Emerald card instead of my own card. I asked why and she said that I would get the money quicker if I just put it on their card. I went back into the office after the 1 day was up (no money was on the card) and I talked to another person and the man checked and told me that the bank denied me. I asked why did they run my credit and he said yes. I said why would they when the money is my own money and it's guaranteed from the government. He said that its a bank thing and they look at it as though they are the one giving you the money. If I had known that they were going to check my credit (to get my own money) and that the money would not be there as promised in 1 to 2 days I would have went somewhere else and not paid all that money. What about the peace of mind? The lady told me if you weren't satisfied you would not have to pay the fees. But at the time of getting my taxes done I was happy because I thought that I would have the money in 1 to 2 days. But obviously I am not happy now. I was misinformed. Does that mean I can get get the fees back? I have been checking every day. But no luck. They said that I would now get the money in 8 to 15 days. I checked with the IRS tonight and I find out that they are processing it and I should receive my money around the 17th which means that that is over the 1 to 2 days and it is definitely over the 8 to 15 days. I will not be going back to H and R Block. I am not satisfied in the least! If they had told me that I would get my money in the correct time period that would be one thing but to mislead people into thinking that you would definitely have the money sooner is wrong. I have had loss of sleep due to worrying about when I will be getting my money. I was hoping to help my mother sooner than later.
I went to have my taxes done on Jan 24th and was told and was going to pay for the 48 hr return and was told 48hrs later the bank denied it. I then contacted IRS and was told it should be available Feb 6th and that they only disburse payments on Fridays. Well the 6th came and nothing available on the emerald card that I was given. I then called IRS AGAIN and stayed on hold, as usual, for 25 mins then an agent answered and told me the date is now Feb 14th, I told her I was told that they told me that payments were only disbursed on Fridays. She said no that's when we are going to release it but that I will have to wait until that Friday to get it. The next day I decided to call h&r block to let them know what was going on and they said they don't understand what's going on their computer says it was suposed to be released the 6th, and that the IRS disburses checks on Wednesday's. How could a company like this, which has been doing this for so many years not know the proper information on when checks are disbursed? I got no where with h&r so I decided to call the IRS back and ask again and got a totally different answer I was told that h&r has made quite a few mistake's and that is what is holding it up. They have to fix all their errors then review it then they'll release it. I am now looking at, IF I AM LUCKY, Feb 24th. My Father lives hours away from me and is very sick and needs me there and because this money did'nt come when it was supposed to, my ins has canceled and I have no vehicle to get there. I am behind in my bills and household expenses. I just contacted h&r block again and was told that the man who did the return is no longer with the company but that he was just there and left. I asked, did you tell him about this problem? He said no. AND I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THIS. AND HUNG UP ON ME. I then found a number and called it and asked if they would have a manager call me back and was told yes. We'll see if they try to fix this problem. I sure hope so. THis is far from over they got paid and did NOTHING...JUST SOME PAPERWORK. I've done all the foot work tracking it down and calling Irs not them they have yet to call me on their own. Ya know why cause they got their MONEY ALREADY. My bills are all behind almost a turn off with my electric, things my children need. I WILL NEVER NEVER EVER USE h&r block. notice I did'nt even capitalize h&r block they don't deserve it
On January 30, 2008 I sent my mother to wester union to wire $400.00 to my hr block prepaid emerald card. She got the receipt for the transaction. The money never got to my account. Its listed as a reversal transaction on my statement. When hr block bank recieved the wire transfer they have to send western union a sequence number to let them know they got it. Hr block bank sent them a sequence number to verify thay they had my money but I never got the money from hr block bank. For a whole week I've been calling western union and hr block bank to find out what happened to my money. I've been talked rude to and hung up on. Nobody wants to pay me my money. If I owed them they would take me to court and try to sue me. I would have to pay court cost and intrest. I feel they should do the same. But my number one concern is my $400.00. I have bills that have to be paid. Times are hard and I don't have money to be taken from me like that. Not only that several customer service reps are being very rude to me.
Well the more I sit here and read these testimonies, the angrier I am getting. I filed my taxes on 1/17/09. To date, 2/7/09, I still have not received a refund. I had never used H&R block, but because of an extremely dire situation I needed the money fast. I had never heard of any problem with H&R block outside of the exorbant fees, but I was willing to shell out the money for the SERVICE. I had no clue that I would be getting a credit check, and I ask them this several times before even sitting down and they told me NO. I asked them if I could find out the fees before hand so that I could make an informed decision they told me they could only give me a range which was fine at the time, if they had delivered the service promised. Needless to say, and to make a long story short, I have been told everything from the IRS is holding your money to your application was not approved because we could not authenticate the validity of your application. And of course these were thrown out from automated systems. it is saturday and I've tried to reach HSBC at 888-832-5625 to find out what they mean by this but surprise, surprise! they are experiencing a high volume of calls and hanging up on people....i wonder why? I have incurred HUNDREDS of dollars in overdraft fees from my very unsympathetic bank National City because I am spending money that I have anticipated. I am completely stressed out because I have made promises to creditors based on this false expectation--one including my mother who is also my landlord and probably thinks I am lying about not receiving my money. I can't focus in school or work. I have been made to look unreliable, untrustworthy and unethical, when in fact it is these two companies that fall under those descriptions.
Just found out after foolishly applying for a RAL, that I was denied. Had I known about this scam beforehand, I would have saved myself a few hundred dollars and did my taxes free at home. I'd like to talk to anyone who actually got the instant RAL. I was bumped to the classic after I was denied the instant (which was a shock). I just found out I was denied for that as well. So I go online to check my credit report- nothing is behind, I dont owe anyone anything other than $46 on my sears charge account. My credit score is 741 which makes me wanna slap myself in the forehead, because I could have just got a line of credit from the bank for a ton less. I had no idea the tax prep fees I was in for until after I got to the end and was in shock. I'd gone that far I figured, and I was 100% I'd get the loan and was denied. I have had my job for 5 1/2 years and lived in the same residence for longer than that. I have a car payment, up to date and credit cards that are completely paid off except my sears card. Oh! What a fool I feel like after reading all these reviews. I'd seriously like to meet the person who really got that loan(if you exist!) What a scam! Now I paid all that money for NOTHING. I paid an outrageous amount of fees for something I could have done FREE online at home and got my refund in the same 8-15 day time frame.
Jan 31, 2009 I went to H&R Block as I have on and off for over 10 years. I always apply and get accepted for the Rapid Anticipation Loan. Not this year. First off, she had my taxes done in 20 minutes. Second off, I was told that I was approved for the loan, then later at home I was told by the 1-800 number that I was denied by the bank. I called the office and was told that a paper check would be issued sometime this week. I went in on Thursday to see if my check was in. The girl said she had to ask the manager, who apparently was the one who did my taxes. She then claimed it would take 8-15 days! I could have filed online for free and gotten it faster. I paid $403 in fees for a rapid check, and I have nothing. I told her I was very unhappy, and she gave me the phone number of her district manager. However, when I called the number right in front of her, it was an invalid extension number. She tried to tell me that was the only number she had for him. Then I was told to come back on Friday, my check should be in. I went back today, and of course no check. I am trying to move out of my apartment since I haven't had cold water in over 3 weeks now. Looks like I will be waiting longer. I was told to try again tomorrow morning, as the checks for the RAL's are brought in then. Wish me luck! I will never use H&R Block again, and I tell everyone I know not to use them either. Good thing I have a loud voice, I know of at least ten customers I have cost them already. I cannot move out of my apartment into a new one until I get that money. I also cannot fix my car, which is losing oil at a rapid pace, along with bad brakes.
I went in to get my taxes done on 02/03/09. Was told was eligible for a RAL for 1 to 2 days. ON 02/05/09, I called to see about my check that is supposed to come from this office. Was told there wasn't any new news. I called again on 02/06/09, I was told I didn't qualify for the RAL. Instead, I was told they switched me to a RAC, and, it would take 8 to 16 days to get my refund. I was told their fees will be reduced. I think this is classic Bait and Switch. First, I was eligible for a 1 to 2 day Refund Anticipation Loan, Then, 3 days later, was told they switched me to a RAC. I could have mailed my return personally and got faster results. I had no say in them switching me to a RAC. No reason was given. Now, I'm paying them extra, in essence, for something I could have done myself, and, would have had control over! I wonder how many other people they do, or, have done this to.
After filing my taxes at a smaller tax office for years without any problems, regretably this year I opted to file with H& R Block. They advertise lower fees and "MONEY NOW" and I was drawn to trust them to complete my taxes. Like all the others I applied for the 1-2 day RAL (like I do EVERY YEAR) and was declined. SInce then I have received no answers, cannot speak with anyone and was immediately referred to the IRS. I am so upset that no one told me there was a credit check, or whatever they are doing this tax season. I like the others are waiting 8-14 days and have paid my $300 for nothing. read more hide
I went there for the 2 day tax refund where i was told it was no problem,they stated the criteria for the loan was if you had past trouble with the irs or social services, the next day im told i was declined that i have to wait 15 days-ive spent countless hours on hold not to get any help-took me 6 calls to mary to get her to come to the phone and even tell me i was declined, thay charged me over 100 dollars for a simple efile i had a 25 dollar coupon that she said was applied which i see no where was applied. I could have done my own efile the only reason i went there was to get the rapid refund-- they lost a customer and ive been using them for 18 years read more hide
Dianne M asked how would we like our ral. She offered a check, direct deposit or emerald card. My husband an I told her that we tried the card years ago and didn't like it. We told her that they had too many fees. She assured us that it wasn't like that anymore. She also said as long as we went to a comerica or chase bank they have no fees. So we went with the emerald card. The next day we went to the comerica bank and went inside to a teller and they told us it was $20 to have all the money off the card. So we said forget it and just went to the atm at their bank. We were charged $3 and then another $1.95 for just using the atm. When i called h & r block and told them what was happening all they said was sorry nothing we can do. If i would've known all these charges would accur i wouldn't have gone this route at all. I paid a lot of money to have my taxes done and then on top of that i get charged more money for using the card. read more hide

UPDATE to RAL denial 2/5/09: After numerous phone calls we FINALLY got some answers and a solution. HSBC was in fact not at fault in our situation. What happened was somehow when applying for the RAL our application to HSBC for the Instant and 1-2day RAL(not the IRS. IRS received it once) was sent 3 times in approx. 3mins (we want to believe this is a glitch in the software at H&R but we don't know). Because of that there had been a security freeze on our return at HSBC (not good). Because we called HSBC and went through a security evaluation, they were FINALLY convinced we were who we said we were and the freeze was lifted. But once a Instant or 1-2day ral isn't approved it stays that way or so we were told. If it wasn't for us contacting the bank our refund was going back to the IRS. We were told by the supervisor that we were not the only ones effected by this situation (with that being said, please call HSBC and verify why your ral was denied , I can't stress this enough). Now Back to H & R Block : Upon calling H & R we decided to bypass the office and go straight to the Ass. Area DM. He was very rude to us and basically told us that this just could not of happened PERIOD !!! Not willing to listen to the FULL scenario he just wouldn't allow us to explain so we asked for his bosses phone # . We called the Area DM (very nice man) and he listened to us very carefully to what happened . In all truth this was a very hard situation to deal with. Could this of been software glitch ?? Maybe , or could this of been a unforeseen issue(problem)the tax preparers weren't aware of ? most likely. I guess what I'm trying to say is. Don't be so quick like me to put the blame on somebody. Do your research. Call HSBC 1st(mornings preferable(we called at 6am pacific time)). If it's the same prob. as ours they will most likely put you through a series of security questions to identify you. Now you may not get your ral instantly (as said in above statement). But at least (hopefully) you get your money in 8-15days on your emerald card. Instead of sending back to the IRS. Our situation was rectified . Hopefully yours with enough involvement (HSBC & H&R Block) will be the same way (hopefully easier). read more hide

Having filed for the RAl product for 17 years with no problem and having also receiving a pre approved mailing I am a little dismayed that my refund through HSBC was denied. There was no mention that the bank had different criterias or that many people regardless of how long they had been filing were being denied. Nothing on my return had changed and hasnt in the past 7 years ( and that was a change of address). I went in knowing exactly what I was getting back because I had done them myself at home, the only reason for using H R Block is for the the Ral.If I had been informed that there was a good chance that my Ral would not have been approved I would never have chosen to be charged $200 for something I could have done myself. Now I have to worry about whether or not I will actually receive my refund in the 8-15 days as stated in the notice from the 24 hr online status check from H R Block. read more hide
I have been using H&R block for the past few years and never had anything like this happend to me before. i went there on friday jan.30,2009 and did all my paper work i was told everything was a go and that i would be getting my refund deposited into my emerald card. 2 days later (monday) i called to see what was taking so long and they told me that something was wrong with my information. i went into the office again and found out that some of my information was invalid...we fixed that and the next day i got a call saying i would not be recieving my refund for another 8-15 days i did NOT give them any consent stating that i was okay with that process. i needed the money asap and was willing pay the fees but my worker insisted that i said it was okay. when i went back in on wednesday i was told that they tried to put my information in so much times and it got declined so much times that the irs had to get involved now who knows how longer my refund is gonna take or if im even gonna get any. i want to speak to a main person from H&R block but the numbers i call gives me the run arounds each time i call. who can i speak to? can this problem be resolved? read more hide
For the past 6 years I have gone to H&R Block and received the 1-2 day rapid refund (now called RAL) loan. I have never had an issue with it. On Tuesday the 27th of Jauary 2009, I went to H&R Block to file my taxes a little early due to a few pending items I needed done, such as making a decision on fixing my car and dental surgery. I actually pre-filed my taxes and knew exactly what refund amount I was due ($2119). The only reason I go to H&R Block and pay their ridiculous fees is to get my money in 1-2 days. I had a conversation about this with my tax preparer that night. After preparation, the federal refund amount matched what I expected. I was given the option of either the same day loan or the 1-2 day standard RAL, just as I always was. The tax preparer informed me that the same-day loan involved a credit check, and after I asked, she claimed the 1-2 day loan was not based on credit. I was aware of this from my previous experience at H&R Block, so I decided that although my credit is better than it has ever been, and I had a couple days before I needed the money, I would not run my credit for the same day loan and opt instead for the 1-2 day RAL. Like so many people I have read about, the very next day the H&R block branch calls me and states that my RAL had been denied. The person on the phone was quite pushy to get me off the phone, while I was trying to ask questions such as if it was a mistake or if the refund was not approved by the IRS. I had a similar situation a few years ago where the refund was not approved. Apparently, this is not the case. I am due the full amount from the IRS, yet the RAL was still not approved. Now I have to wait 10-16 days for my money to be direct deposited into these thieves' account and hope the money gets deposited onto my little green 'emerald card' a few days later. Oh yeah, minus the ridiculous fees these scam artists charge! $2119 full tax refund due Delayed emergency dental surgery $800 pain and suffering Told car shop to repair my car for pickup over the weekend. My car was out of commission due to this for more than a week. $680 read more hide
I've been deceived by H&R Block's lack of training, believeing that they really know what their doing. On 2/2/09 I visited a location in Carrollton, TX to inquire about the fast refund which I was considering for the first time depending on the fees involved, but I was told that the paperwork had to be completed before I could be told what fees were associated with a quick refund and this would be at no charge. I walked in stating my position clearly and was not explained at all how the quick refund worked but was told that a quick refund is what they do. I found out one day later when I called their credit card that my funds would not be deposited until 8-15 days later? I called the location and was told by both the manager and leader that there is nothing they can do. That is nto acceptable. Apparently, it's a bank loan not an H&R Block loan that has to be approved and if not then H&R Block automatically does the return 8-15days refund without notifying the customer or explaining this. The prep guy electronically signed all the forms in front of me using a pin# that I provided as a setup but never printed the forms or allowed me to read them. Yes, I should have read them, but honestly that is why I went to such a place thinking they had integrity. I called to complain and both the leader and manager are telling me there is nothing they can do, which is not acceptable. They can refund my tax preparation fees to make amend as this is their lack of training and false advertisement on their part. I am being charged with over $250 in fees when I could have filed with Turbo Tax like I do everyear for FREE and have my return in the same amount of time directly to my bank account, not some credit card! I am being charged for a service by H&R Block which was not provided.I think H&R Block should be held accountable for the lack or training and false advertisement that people are led to believe good service is provided. And held accountable for service standards that customers do not see! read more hide
well i went to file my taxes this year at my usual place h&r block. i use them because well they are pretty fast, friendly and offer good products. i have been in fact a loyal customer for about 13 years now.I am one of the people who always do the rapid refund/ral loan it cost a bit more but i always walk outta of the office with a check in hand that day... well not this year? Im guesing with the bad economy the banks are just being a bit tighter or who knows im a bit upset. first of all this is not really a real loan in the fact that they get thier money straight from the irs not me once i get the check i have never gone back to do anything other then to file my next years return? so where is the gratatude for being loyal? i just dont understand why they would refuse me this year when i have always been able to get one before. i usually pay about 300 to get my taxes done and the bank fees so they make money off me to put back into this bad economy? im really just perplexed. this will for sure be my last year with h&r block since it was useless for me to pay 200 to get my taxes done when i could of done them online for free and got my money in the same amount of time. read more hide
I went to do my taxes today (2-4-2009) and of course like everyone else who is in need of extra cash I chose to do the 1-2 day rapid refund. So I called a few hours just to check the status and to my surprise I was denied the rapid refund. In all i paid $300 for nothing! Not once did the man at H&R Block tell me that there was a possibility that I may not be approved. NEVER do your taxes with H&R BLOCK; I have learned that it does not hurt to wait a little! read more hide
We have always gotten a rapid refund. We paid to get a 2 day rapid refund and were denied with no explanation. From what ive seen and heard there are thousands of complaints just like ours where people are not getting theyre rapid refund but still being charged for it with no explanation. We had a severe ice storm. President called it a national disaster. We have lost all our food. If we would have had our refund we could have fed our children and maybe bought a generator to warm our family. read more hide

My son and I are on the verge of being homeless! I was laid off and now a full time student. I needed this money to get is back on track!The rep told me she got the Emerald Card and she loved it. The fees are ridiculous but I need the money fast! I waited my 2 days (nothing) so I called to find I had been denied! The office couldn't offer any explanation why! I didn't know about any credit check and now I have to wait 8-15 days? When I could have done that from the start. I WILL NEVER return to H&R Block, they are dishonest and they don't stand behind us! Now I am stuck hoping our landlord has a understanding heart or knows about H&R Block and feels sorry for [me]! My nerves are shot. I am worried that my son and I won't have a home soon.

As with the other complaints, I went to HR block and filed my taxes as I did in the past to get my refund quicker with the RAL. The gentleman who did me and my wifes taxes said to choose between the emerald card and the paper check. We chose paper check and he said we would get it in 1-2 business days. He did not mention nothing about pending credit approval or that we may be denied. Next day I call the number for status and it was denied. I called the HR branch and they were pointing the finger at hsbc. I called hsbc and they had a recorder message and no direct line to a person. SCAM. If I wanted to wait 8-15 days I would have done it myself, not pay 377.00. I called there corporate and was suppose to get a response back 24-48 hours. Guess what its been over 48 hours, no response. Every one should file a complaint with their states attorney general so they can get enough complaints to investigate this. You can do it online. Im done with HR Block and their unethical misleading ways. read more hide
Filed with H&R Block like we have for 12yrs ,went with the RAL . Got denied for one day return and opt for the 1-2 day (never been denied in the past) . Went to https://www.myreturnstatus.com/index.php and received this Unfortunately your Refund Anticipation Loan has not been approved. Upon receipt of proceeds from the IRS, your refund will be deposited onto your H&R Block Emerald Prepaid MasterCard. The IRS refund deposit typically occurs within 8 - 15 days from the date your return was accepted. Please call again at that time to see if your refund has been deposited. For more information regarding your Refund Anticipation Loan please call HSBC Now I'm wondering what's going on. We have never been denied before so why now? I called my tax preperator and he said he has never seen this code pop up code 09 RAL IRS Direct Deposit Then asked me if I owed money to the IRS. Well here's what I think it means. HSBC will deny me my ral (for some stupid reason) then receive my refund then transfer my refund to my emerald card 8-15 days not including weekends and holidays. HSBC operators are a joke, waited 30min the she introduced herself and ask how she could help . I told her what I saw on the website and she proceeded to to me the reason for denial. I DIDN'T EVEN GIVE HER MY NAME AND SS#! She backed up and apologized 2-3 times and said she was on the wrong page. So I give her my name ss# then proceeds to ask me 4-5 questions pertaining to forgery with and without my SS card then says she needs to transfer me to security something and transfers me over to a dept. that closed 1hr prior to the call. I couldn't even leave a message. I'm feeling the runaround here. So I call back to H&R Block where a woman was very kind with my attitude and explained to me that 9+% of all RALs are being denied due tightening credentials and that a large percentage of last yrs filing were rejected by the irs cause of fraud (red flagged) on the customers end (Bogus EIC filings being one example) and that the bank lost money trying to get filers to pay back there loans. NOW I'M REALLY LOST, What's that got to do with me? I GIVE UP. So I'll wait, as if I have a choice. I did tell her that if she knew this why wern't customers informed of this and why didn't our tax preparer tell us and that if 9+% of the people are being denied so we could opt out if we wanted to. Wait I know why, then where would H&R Block be? Closed.... I learned my lesson the hard way. It was convenient (RAL) while it lasted but due to the Economy and Statistics (CUT THROAT Businesses) I feel it's over and we all need to beware of it. read more hide
My wife and I was part of the H & R Block RAL scam. Her and I went into the office on February 2, 2009 at 9:45 a.m. We walked into the H&R Block office thinking that today was going to be a great day. I had filed there every year for the past several years with no problems. We was great with kindness and respect. The lady told us that she had been doin taxes for 30 years and she knew what she was doing. We started the tax process and everything seemed to be okay. The lady said she found a problem with the system and that it came across that I owed something. I informed her that I owed for child support which has never been a problem with my taxes before. The lady then presented this siuation to her manager. The story then was told that we had to pay up front. The woman that was doing our taxes went ahead and proceed on knowing that their system had messed up already. She had me to call the IRS, which informed me that they had no hold on my account. Then I was given another number to call which backed up my story of the fact that I owed for child support. So, as the process went on, they asked us how we wanted our money and we told them the same day. The lady put in the information to get it back the same day. It was a RAL. So the lady told us that we were denied, but we should get it in 1-2 days for sure. They never told me or my wife that they was doing a credit check on us. The next day we called them and they told us that we was denied by the IRS. So I called the IRS and we was told that they had no record of our income taxes on file. We even went to the IRS website and nothing showed up. So we called H&R Block back and they gave us some bank phone number. The bank told me that I owed $404.70 from the previous year. I was never informed of a debt owed to me in regards to my income taxes. I was told then that it was denied on behalf of that balance and a credit check. I was also told if H&R Block resubmitted the income taxes that they would take the fees out. When I informed the office of the siuation they told me that the IRS had it and there was not anything that could be done even though the IRS HAD NOT RECEIVED IT. The lady at the IRS told us that it takes 48 hours for the information to appear in their system. I called another H&R Block, the lady there told me that it could be resubmitted if the IRS had not received it. My wife then called the place that I had called and they told her that they could not do anything and that they had not given us any information of that nature. They was very rude and impolite to her. The bank still is going to charge us for the fees just as if they was going to give us the loan. The H&R Block office told us that we wasnt going to be charged because the IRS was going to give us the refund and that meant that our refund would not go through any bank. We was lied to and given the run around about our taxes. Thank You for your support and cooperation! The consequences of that is we have no lights, no gas, and we are behind on our rent. We told these people that we would have the money within 1-2 DAYS. WE HAVE BEEN THREATENED TO BE REMOVED FROM OUR HOME. I have taken severe emotional damages because of what I put my faith into something that I have worked so hard for and people then turn around and do me like this. My wife has been having major headaches and stomach pains because of the fact we have not received our money and we are cold and do not have any electricity. WE NEED SOMEONES HELP WITH THIS BECAUSE H&R BLOCK IS RIPPING PEOPLE OFF AND IT NEEDS TO BE STOPPED. My job has been only giving me about 8 hours a week and we was really depending on receiving our income taxes. We do not have any money. read more hide
I went to H&R Block like always. I have been going there for at least 17 years. I filed my taxes on Jan.18, 2008 and was told that I would receive my money in 1-2 (classic RAL) on the Emerald card. Still as of today, 02/03/08, I haven't received a dime of my money. They called me this past Saturday night to let me know that I would not be receiving my money for another 7-10 days. I'm a single mother of two children. I was depending on that money to catch me up on my bills and car payment. This has put me in a bind. I never thought the company that I have always trusted would have a scam like this going on. read more hide
I filed my taxes on January 24, 2009, paid for 1-2 RAL. Just on a whim I called the Emerald card to see if My funds were there, well sure enough it was. I Received my money after 5:00 pm on the very same day that I filed. I thought oh good, I only paid for the 2 day but received the funds in one day. Here's the clincher, I spent $1,000 of the money then went to spend the other $2000.00 and the card was declined. Called HR Block and they said that I never received a refund and that they don't know where my money is. Funny Ispent $1,000 of money that I did not receive. Called the IRS they informed me that my return was approved. So now $2000.00 of my money is gone without a trace. HSBC says that the money was deposited into another card? What!! Another card? That is a card I had 2 years ago and long since cancelled! HR Block says that it was never deposited into any other card and that they do not know what HSBC is talking about. My head is spinning!!!!!!! IRS will run a trace. I WILL NEVER AND WILL CONTINUE TO DISCOURAGE ANYONE FROM HAVING THEIR TAXES PREPARED BY HR BLOCK. IF ANYONE WANTS TO FILE SUIT I AM SO THERE! read more hide
We had H&R Block prepare our 2008 income tax on 01/31/09. We were due a $2024 refund. We opted to pay extra $ to receive the refund within 2-3 business days. Then we were informed that due to credit reasons, we were denied the acceleration loan from HSBC. We didn't know what they were even talking about since we were not informed about any loan or HSBC. Otherwise, we would've gone directly through either Turbo Tax or IRS. The biggest frustration was that we couldn't get any information from either H&R Block or HSBC as to why we were denied. We were given a phone # for HSBC (1-to contact but whenever we tried calling, would only get a recording. No matter what we tried, we couldn't get any information from anyone about why we were denied, etc. H&R Block was no help and stated that that was the only phone # for HSBC that they had and that they had not had any trouble talking to a live person. They couldn't help us any further. We called IRS, who told us that the refund had been approved and they showed that we did not owe any back taxes and that they did not know why we couldn't get our refund from HSBC within the time frame promised. We tried the HSBC phone # several times along with other phone #'s that we tried off the internet but no one at either HSBC or H&R could help us with any info. There is no way we would've gone this route had we been informed that we were applying for a loan! We didn't even give our consent for a credit check!! How can they legally do this and continue to get by with this? And why would IRS participate in this? We needed the quick refund to help my Dad who needed to get his truck out of the shop for repairs (1,500) and uses his truck to haul heavy equipment for his job/livelihood! In addition, my wife just started a new job (02/02/09) and she won't get a paycheck until 3 weeks from now due to the first week being held back and then the regular 2-week pay period! We don't know what we're going to do but regardless with whatever happens with this complaint report won't help us much right now, when we need it! What a mess and burden this has created! We will never use H&R Block again! This kind of scam needs to be stopped! It's apparently not the first time H&R Block and HSBC have been guilty of their partners in crime scheme and is there not anybody out there to tell us how to talk to a real person at HSBC to answer our many questions? What's going on? read more hide
I had my 2008 taxes done at H and R block as I did last year. I got the same Rapid Refund as I did last year. I was told that I would get my money in 1-2 days on an emerald card. The next day I was told that my rapid refund was denied with no explaination of why, Now, I am having to wait 2-3 weeks for my refund and I am having to pay the fees associated with that, thinking that I would get the rapid refund and then denied. I could have done my taxes on my own for free and had no fees to pay. They basically ripped me off and many others from what I have been reading on the internet. This injustice needs to stop, I will not be returning to H and R Block next year. I will just do my taxes myself and keep the $300 they are charged me for nothing. read more hide
Last year I paid for same day Refund and got it half one day and half two days later with no less charge. This year I get my taxes prepared and after the whole process my wife and I choose the emerald card same day refund. The lady types it all in and says that the bank approved partial now and the large amount in 1-2 days. Other than wondering why 2 days would make a difference I consented and signed the loan agreements. One for the same day and another for the 1-2 day. It shows fees on both loan agreements. I spend part of the first amount and after 2 days notice the large amount isnt on the card. I call and find out that an offset from a state I havent lived in for 4 years has arisen and the bank denied my loan. I find out what that was about and resolve the issue accept for the h and r block part. I am now recieveing my return in 8 to 15 days but paying fees for 1-2. H and R says the bank owes the fees back and the bank says H and R owes me. Either way I paid for a service that was denied and someone should pay the money back. I understand the fees for the amount recieved on day one but the rest should be refunded. I told them I wouldve waited 8-15 and saved the money but I purchased the same day and 1-2 under the pretense that I was recieving the rest within 2 days. I spent some of the money so canceling isnt an option. Oh and I've read that they are checking credit before dispursing refunds which is fine for loan approval but I have talked with several who say they got a different amount because of credit debt they owed which that is not disclosed by H and R when applying for refund loans. Oh and finally the location manager would not tell me the corporation or supervisors number I had to call another branch and fake a scenario to get it. read more hide
My complaint is the same as most on this page. I'm waiting on my refund and they said I did not quailfy for the RAL. I did last year with no problem. I have had no other debt since last year, and I do not owe the IRS anything.I have always paid my taxes (when I owed). My rent is now past due and I don't know what I am going to do.

i went in to h&r block to do my taxes. When i was doing my taxes i was told that i do not quailify for the same day , but i do quailify for the 1 to 2 day loan. I said okay. that find. Well todays went by and no money. So i called the h&r bank and they said i was denied for the 1 to 2 day loan. I do not recall signing anything to run my credit. I even reviewed my packet and it said nothing of the sort. I was definitly lied to and i feel hur cause i have used h&r block for years with no problem. Also there was a form for me to sign that says that i can cancel in 5 days so i signed that form and took (before the date dued) and they told me that i cant do that because it already has been filed. so i said that form means nothing and they said basically yes. And i pretty much have to deal with it. I wish tht there was a company that deals with dishonest companies like this one. But then i come to think about it. Maybe h&r block is broke cause they spent 3 million on a super bowl comercial. Also i check irs and they have not recieved the tax info. my husband is working part time and i go to school full time and we are on the verge of loosing our car which we take our son places all because we were told do not worry you will have your money. read more hide
I filed my income tax return on 1/26/09, opted for the 1-2 day loan done through their bank. I waited 5 days, and still no check. I went back personally and was told I had been denied for a RAL and to call the HSBC phone number on the back of my contract to get the status of my refund account. The recording promises a letter of explanation in 7-10 days. H & R Block had no other information regarding the status of my refund after charging me more than $300 in tax fees.

I had my taxes done at H & R Block in hopes of receiving the 1-2 day RAL as I always have in previous years. I was denied, and now have to wait 8-15 days, and I have paid extra money for the loan which I am sure will not be refunded. I also paid extra for the Emerald Card because I thought I would get the money in 1-2 days, which I couldn't have done with my own checking account. Now I don't need the Emerald Card, but you can bet I paid for it anyway. I am not mad that the loan was denied. I am very mad that I was told you'll have your money by Monday. I was never told my credit was a factor, or that there was a possibility that the money would not be there. It is not their fault that my finances are in a shambles, but it would have been nice to have had some truthfulness in this transaction, so that I could have made an informed decision. I would not have paid for a card I didn't need, much less a loan I knew my credit would not support, if I had known that it was even a factor. I was mislead, and for no other reason than to get my money, which I cannot spare at this time. I thought there were truth in lending laws. In the past I have received my RAL within hours of leaving the office, so I made some empty promises to debtors unknowingly. I now have to try to re-negotiate with these people and I am faced with losing my childcare and my car insurance. It is just unfair that I was not informed whatsoever that my credit would be a factor. read more hide
My wife and I went to H and R block to get our taxes done the date was 1/20/09...after we were finished we paid the 237 dollar fee and a extra 30 dollars to get our taxes in a 8 to 15 day period...well 2 weeks later we are sitting here still waiting for our tax refund. My wife called the H and R block we dealt with and he neglected to tell us that he received a email about us on Friday 1/30/09 saying they just ran our paper work through, and we wont be receiving our taxes until the end of this week no earlier then Thursday, i want our 30 dollars back therefore we did not receive our taxes when promised, i feel like we are getting screwed out of 30 dollars and i would like it back. read more hide
Well looks like I am also the victim of H&R blocks Ral scam. It has been 4 days since I opted for the 1-2 day Ral. I just looked it up on HSBC site and I saw that I was denied. I do not owe out any money to anyone and have 700+ credit score. Not to mention that H&R block claims right on the advertisements in thier offices that there IS NO CREDIT CHECK. Why would we pay the preperation fees if we could just file ourselves online and get it back in 9 days from rapidtax.com. I have used rapid tax for 3 years without a hitch. I decided to go with H&R block after a coworker got the emerald card suprisingly with no problems. I wished I had read up on the net about what we are all now going through before going there. I am beside myself as now I will have to pay the fees for the 1-2 ral and still get it in 8-15. This is a scam. I feel like going down to the office where I did my taxes and throwing the slap down on ppl there but that would not solve anything. I have not even made an official phone calls as I researched myself and saw why i was rejected. well not why. Just that I was. We need to start a website for a class action suit. Im not in thwe situation like some that i feel bad for that need it asap. But i was willing to pay to have it asap because its like found money in a way (my mentality) i am very dissapointed and I feel like i was taken for a ride. read more hide
For at least the last 10 years , I have gotten the Rapid Refund through H and R block, and I read where there is a class action suit going on with them. I was wondering if I had any recourse against them? I am a low income worker, and I feel I was charged very large fees to get my refund fast. They make it sound so tempting, to get our money back real fast, a matter of days to be exact,but in the long run I was out a couple hundred dollars every year. read more hide
I went to H&R block to file my taxes and applied for their Refund Anticipation Loan (RAL) which I was supposedly eligible in 1-2 days. I'm given a card and a phone number. The next day I find that no money has been put on the card so I called the manager to ask what was going on and they told me that I was suddenly denied for the RAL. I asked why and was told that it was not for any kind of back taxes or anything. She basically told me that it was for unknown reasons and that the bank was denying a lot of people this year and that she believes it's because of the failing economy... My response was that conning people into your shop and suckering out of $200 and leaving them in a position where they do not have the money they need when it was promised was definitely not helping the failing economy. So now I'm supposedly waiting 8-15 days for my refund. I could have easily filed my taxes for free myself and I like many others only used h&R block for their RAL as I'm sure they are aware. Why aren't they being straight about this? Something has to be done.
I too was duped by HSBC bank. I have went to H & R block for 2 years now. Last year I was granted a RAL the day after I filed my taxes, no problem and it was such an easy experience I returned there this year. This year I filed on Jan. 23rd. I was told I qualified and would have my Refund within 2 days applied to their Emerald Card. After two days I found out I was denied this loan... afte being approved on the 23rd. the explanation was that the bank muct have kicked it out. i have tried to contact HSBC but was told I'd receive and explanation in the mail but that has not arrived either. So I still have not received my money and its been 10 days. I am being told I will receive it after the IRS checks my return and it'll be 8-15 from filing date but the IRS says they will be done processing by Feb. 10th but nothing sooner. This is so frustrating. I will never go back to H & R Block because the tax preparer should not have assured me that my money would be available to me within 2 days. Then HSBC bank denies my RAL after they gave me an Emerald Advance card in November. My credit did not change in 2 months. What a joke!!!
This complaint is pretty much a repeat of the others but it happen to me also. I went to the same H&R Block office I have been going to for the past 4 years to do my taxes. I went on January 30th. Just like everyone else I was in need of money as soon as possible. I almost didn't go because I needed all the money I could get and we all know H&R Block has very high filing fees but I needed my money now so I didn't do the efile at home. I tried to get the instant refund but was denied and then was told I was approved for the 1-2 day refund on the emerald card. After day two came around I called the HSBC number and was told I was not approved and I would have my money 8-15 days. I could have done the 8-15 day efile at home for nothing! That just beats the whole purpose of going to H&R Block if I can't get my money quick because that is the only reason I go there. The fact that I was told I was approved for the 1-2 refund is very misleading. If I was told in the office it would be 8-15 days, I would have not went any further and would have left and filed at home for free.
Went to the Blockheads to do my taxes. Have 4 children, and always used H&R block in the past. Usually, the total bill comes to ~$120. Previous years info was not found. Spent over 1hr with the preparer. Bill this year came to over $400! There were some changes, bought a house, borrowed from 401k etc. When I looked at the fee breakdown, they charged a fee for every child, charged a $40 fee for a $30 credit and really nickle and dimed me. I did not want any type of loan or advance, this was strictly a preperation fee. The consequences were me getting very upset and my wife dragging me out of H&R block cursing. We went to a financial advisor who was excellent. Took us in on his spare time, gave great advice. His normal clientel are much more affluent then me, but he treated us like gold and I will now use him for all my financial planning. I recommend people find a private tax preparer. They will be cheaper and can offer great advice. I will never use a preditory company like H&R block again.
Like many others on this site, I was lied to and misled by HR Block. Like everyone else, I was denied the instant RAL and told, word by word, you weren't approved for the instant refund but you were approved for the RAL and you will get your money in 1-2 days. I specifically asked if there was any way they would deny it, he said no, you are already approved. So imagine my surprise when the very next day I was told that I wasn't approved and I would get my money in 8-15 days. After paying over $500 in fees and agreeing to put $600 on a Roth IRA through the same bank. Now they tell me that I can't get the money back in the amount of time I was told and they are keeping $600 for an IRA that I didn't want in the first place. (My refund was over $10000 and I was not eliglible for RAL due to the amount, so the office manager tells me to put $600 into the Roth and then it will put my refund below the $10000 mark allowing me to get the RAL.) Like everyone else, I have dealt with HR Block for about 10 years with no problem. I will NEVER use them again. I will just file my taxes by myself. What a ripoff and a scam! I filed on Jan 28, 2009 and according to the HR BLock website, the IRS accepted my return on the 29th. But when I check the status of my refund through the IRS website, it says it doesn't have any information. I have read others complaints where at least the IRS was showing their refund being processed. How long should I wait for that? This situation has screwed us financially! We are on the verge of losing our home and desperately need our money before Feb 12. DON'T USE HR BLOCK! I read all of this and still went there thinking, maybe it is just something that happens to some people and it won't happen to me....WRONG! Now I am some people. I want to join in on any suit that we can do. Apparently, they are not new to the lawsuit idea and had one filed in California just a couple of years ago. We need to make them pay! Facing foreclosure on my home and many overdraft charges in my bank account due to believing I was gettingmy money in 1-2 days!
I too went to H&R Block for the RAL. I've had my taxes prepared there ever since I can remember. I opted for the 1-2 day loan choosing the emerald card for disbursement. I filed on 1/30/09 and was told my loan would be there on or about that Saturday or following Monday. After hearing several complaints I would think HR Block would notify people of the problems. I received a call from Pam on Saturday stating my taxes would not be refunded for 8-15 days. I was shocked as I have never had any problems in the past. I know the banks have had alot of problems over the last year and now realize this is part of the problem. But, like others I feel we should have had some warning. I can't see the problem since its backed by the government, right? I guess I'm not surprised as of the bad news about our economy. We got people! YEAH RIGHT! I am dissapointed as I have been laid off and could have used the money. I have a truck payment due. But I will make do, as I have to.
We always use H&R Block. Went to make an appointment and was told they are only doing walk-ins. The Place was packed and had to stand. I noticed people was coming in and signing in and then leaving to return in a few hours. And just so everyone will know it took 4 hours of waiting and preparation to get done. I wasnt about to leave and come back because if you leave they was suppose to put you back in the back of the line. But they didnt. When we finally got to get the tax process started the lady was making mistakes, but she was fixing them. When we were done we didnt go rapid refund. We wanted to have our checks direct deposited like we do every year. But was told they arent doing that this year. Well she should know seeing she is a reprensenative of H&R block. she then told us she had been working since 8:00 a:m without a break. I looked at the time on my cell phone and it was 8:11 p:m. That would explain all the mistakes she was making. So paid the $330.00 And after 4 hours left. I called the district manager to complain and she told me 1.The people whom left was to be put back in the back of the line since there wasnt any appointments. 2.They do have direct deposit and she was wrong. And I couldnt have it corrected. Now will have to wait a month for my checks to be cut. Plus time allowed for mail. as you know could be up to 2 weeks. 3.With all the mistakes they lady was making due to no breaks which i told her i would call the Labor dept, if I was her. if any mistakes was made it would get kicked back. 4.$330.00 We paid for poor service and sloppy preparation. But they got their money so they dont care. but the district manager said she would call that office in Flemingsburg Ky and get things put right. And the owner would call me. But I'm not holding my breath. So to all beware if your going to spend $330.00 To H&R Block. 1.Could have mistakes made due to fatigue on H&R Block part. 2.what might have been 7-15 days getting my checks. Will be about 30-45 due to not knowing her job.3. Backache and headache dut to standing and sitting for 4 hours. 4.Will have to make oyher arrangements because had immediate need for the money in 7-15 days. 5. Paid $330.00 for part of services was paying to get.
First off my husband and I went in for the anticipation loan about 4 weeks ago, we were then approved for the 900.00 because we were to be expecting 10,000 back. When my husband went in to do our taxes the amount was only 7427.00. Then we decided ok mistakes happen, so we decided to then do the 1 to 2 day ral, this was 1-28-09 when we filied and still no money. When I looked it up online for the status it said the IRS put a hold on it, when I called H&R Block the only thing they said was and I quote it could be that you owe for a previous year oryourtaxes were not filed properly. ARE YOU SERIOUS! Not filed properly, ok well that says it all im still waiting for monday so I can call the IRS on the problem, I will not be returning to H&R Block again. they did not even offer a refund for the ral which I did not get or at least a refund for everything. of course if my taxes were not filed correctly (did I mention H&R Block filed my taxes). I hope all you out there take my word for it and that of all the others do your own taxes, really at least you wont be giving your money away .
On January 19th 2009 I filed my taxes with H&R Block. I applied for the same day refund and was denied. They told me it would automatically default to the 1 to 2 day loan and NEVER told me that could be denied as well. I was NEVER informed of any credit check they would be running. The IRS has accepted my return and my refund was to be funded to my emerald card on JANUARY 30TH. I never received my refund. I called HSBC to find out where my money is. I was informed that the address I gave them was not the same one they had on file. Upon further investigation I found out the tax preparer put the wrong city state and zip code on my papers even though I told him, he never corrected that. HSBC made me answer questions over the phone to prove I am who I said. They asked many questions which I answered to the best of my ability and knowledge about prior addresses and people I was associated with. They then said I failed those tests and they would be sending my money back to the IRS and the IRS would have to issue a check to me directly. Even though all these things happened Im STILL being charged inflated fees from H&R BLOCK and they refuse to override those charges even though the mistakes were the preparers. Basically I was promised money in 2 days after the IRS accepted my return. I was lied to and deceived. Someone ran my credit without my consent. I have made payment arrangements for my rent around the date I would get this check. I will be late on my rent further hurting my credit. Running credit checks also drops my credit score, and had I known hey ere doing I NEVER would have consented and wouldve just filed online like I did last year through tax slayer. I needed the money fast, was promised the money fast, and they failed to deliver. I was deceived and want all fees waived and I want my tax refund so I can pay my bills.
On January 19th I filed my taxes with H&R Block because I desperately needed my money fast this year. I tried for the same day loan and was told that was denied, but the preparer told me that it would automatically default to the 1 to 2 days. She never once told me that could also be denied, and also NEVER told me that they would be running a credit check. She simply said that it would be credited 1 to 2 days after the IRS accepted the return. On Monday the 21st the IRS did accept the return. I never received my money. I called the 800 number on the card I was given and was told it should be deposited by that evening. It wasnt. I called the local office the next day and she informed me I had been denied the RAL and that it could take about 8- 10 days to receive my funds. It is now February 1st and I still have no money. My state tax check...according to the Department of Revenue website was deposited on January 29th. HSBC said they never received any money. The state of Indiana tells me that it WAS deposited and I should check with the bank. My son also filed his taxes on the 19th and his federal refund was deposited on the 30th of January, but HSBC is also saying they never received his money either. I was charged an outrageous amount of money to file my taxes, when Im quite capable of filing online myself. The only reason for me going to H&R BLOCK was to get my money faster. They told me I wont be charged a bank fee, but wouldnt tell me how much more I would be refunded. All of their answers seem to be very vague..if they give me an answer at all. Im now close to defaulting on a loan because I had set up arrangements around this check. I will never go back to H&R BLOCK nor will I go to any other company to get a supposed RAL. I will file my taxes online myself..not using H&R BLOCK software. I feel like I was lied to and mislead. I feel like they had no right to do a credit check on me without my consent, and had they told me upfront I wouldve simply walked back out the door and saved myself the trouble. I feel Im in quicksand with these people telling me to contact the IRS and INDIANA DEPT OF REVENUE. All I want is answers, my money, and a complete refund from H& R BLOCK as I feel they used misleading advertising tactics to draw me and many others in.
Paid for an RAL at H&R Block never was told had to be approved just told would have my refund in 1-2 days. Now told my check will go to them then they will go to them they will deposit and give to me. Spent money on groceries because I thought my money would be in to days. This was other bill monies.
i filed my taxes with H&R block for the first and last time. the lady was very nice that helped me with my taxes and when she got to the part about the RAL she told me that i would only be charged 3.21 for it. nothing more nothing less, and i thought wow,thats awesome,$3 and i get my taxes in 2 days? i know that i have to pay it back ,which is no problem, i am a single mom of a 2 yr old, the money sooner would help ALOT. so anyway, i sign all the forms that need to be signed and i leave. when i get home i look over everything an notice, it will cost me about $200 for the loan itself so i wont get everythiong back that the lady told me i would, she didnt explain EVERYTHING to me that had to do with the RAL. so i called her and she said that i have already signed the papers and there's nothing she can do about it now. had i known that it was going to cost so much and i would get so little, i would have NEVER even applied for it, i was under the assumption that it was just going to cost $3 extra. AND on top of that i had a coupon for $20 off my tax prep, gave her the coupon rminded her SEVERAL times to use it for me, finally she took it, i asked her before i left if i got the $20 off, and she said that she used it, again when i looked at my papers there was no discount on it so i mentioned that to her while i was on the phone and she said that she must have forgot and said she was sorry but again there was nothing to be done. i will NEVER go back to H&R block again.
I went to H&R Block for my taxes to get done on Jan. 15th, just like every other year. We went through all the hooplah and finally we were asked how we wanted to file. I have recieved a RAL in the past, our tax return was quite a bit and we opted to go with the RAL. We recieved about 15% of our refund and guaranteed our remaining refund in two business days. I called two business days later to see if the check has printed and they said no. I called the next afternoon and they said it hasnt came again, I wanted to talk with my tax prepairer and she promised to call back. I went through this for a week with no call back. I finally found a number for the illusive HSBC Bank, called them and they said I didnt meet their criteria for the RAL. I asked if they are making the people that do the taxes aware of this criteria, they could not answer. I have left several complaints with both H&R, and HSBC both have caused stress and anger with their lies. It has been 15 days now and I could have saved over $200 just Efiling my tax return. Crooked tactics to suck hundreds of hard-earned dollars from Americans, is this what America has come too? We had to borrow money from a relative since we spent money that we were promised
I went into H&R Block on 1/26/09 to apply for a Refund Anticipation Loan as I have done for all the years I have been working. This is the first year I have been turned down for the (RAL). WHY? After not receiving my loan in 1-2 days as I was told, I went back into H&R BLOCK and spoke with the lady that had prepared my taxes. I had my paper work in hand and asked her was something wrong on my paper work because I had not received the money on my Emerald Card yet. She was quick to tell me I must owe I.R.S. some money. I told her I DON'T THINK SO. Then she said maybe your credit didn't go through. I responded, what does my credit have to do with my refund? She said this year H&R Block is different. I asked how so and if H&R Block is so different this year why you didnt tell me this before I filed for the Refund Anticipation Loan. She said they have no way of knowing if you are not going to be approved for the loan. I responded to her that if you knew yesterday that my credit might be an issue you could have said so and I could have saved $304.00 and filed my taxes online if I was going to have to wait 8-14 days to get my money anyway. I let her know I wouldn't have filed for the RAL if I knew beforehand that my credit might be an issue. Why would I just give H&R Block $304.00 just because? I think it's a scam when H&R Block don't let customers know that their credit might be an issue. Of course they are not going to let customers know because that would be less money for them. That's why the rich is getting richer and the poor is getting poorer. They sent these stimulus checks out in 2008 that were supposed to be an economic boost. Who got these checks? The people that fall under the lower income bracket. I feel like H&R Block just ripped me off for $304.00 tax preparation fees that I was told I was not going to get back because that is their fee.The tax preparer said instead of HSBC charging me $77.68 they will charge $29.95.WOW, what an amazing savings. I actually saved $47.73 in bank fees just to give away $304.00 to H&R Block. So much for the economic boost.
I went to file my taxes as I am a single mother/ grandmother and trying to make ends meet, this seems impossible. So today after filing on Thursday for my RAL loan I was told by a person at H&R that I have to wait til I am accepted and then my return will be on my card within two days. Hello this is not what the lady told me when I filed. She said it was a loan and that I would receive it within two days and that most of her people have received it over night. I believe that if I was able I would higher a lawyer and get the 390.00 that I had to pay back. Soon I will have no lights and it 16 degrees outside, that means no heat either. What has become of the goverment and of course the ones that have lied to use a H&R BLOCK. Is there a fine print they forgot to share with us? Losing everything because all my bills are behind. Raped by H&R Block for 390.00 to get a return in two days that I haven't seen yet.
I went to H&R Block to get my taxes done Jan 16,2009 Just like I do every year.For at least 8 years in a row I always recieved the same day loan. They ran it through and said I didnt qualify.But that I would qualify for the 1-2 loan,unless I owed the IRS money which I dont.I called the bank 2 days later they said I wasnt approved for the 1-2 day loan.They could not give me a reason.Nothing has changed with my credit.They even say it has nothing to do with credit its based on if you owe taxes.Today is the 30th of Jan still no money.I could of filed my taxes online for free and had my money by now.I dont know if its H&R Block or HSBC that is ripping and misleading their customers but something must be done about this its not right!!! My family is experiencing eviction and hardships due to me telling my landlord I would pay him in 2-3 days based on what H&R told me and I looked like a liar and now I will be homeless by the end of next week.I wonder if I will have my money by then.Yesterday i went back to H&R Block they told me I would have it by the 30th.Well I still dont WHERE IS MY MONEY
I received my w2 forms on January 16th 2009 made an appointment with H & R Block ( which have done my returns for 7 yrs)for that day, op tied for the ral which I have gotten many times and this time was denied, Was told that I would recieve my check between the 23 and the 27 of this month, I called the 28th and was told that my check would be at the office on the 30th,,,It is now the 30th and once again called the office and once again no check,,, I then talked with a superviser and was told that they would look futher into this matter,,Got a call from Mr. R and which informed me that my check was not there and the the Government was holding my check and 50 other peoples monies due to a stimulas increase,,,this is a bunch of -----,the government has all year to use all of our money for what they need to,,,as many of you out there I am a single mother with limited income and as the country is in this state of recession all of us need our refunds NOW !!!!!!!! We all need a place to sleep,and if we dont have our money,,, WHERE are we to go??????????????????? no home,,,past due notices, overdrafts on our checking accounts,ect,,,
Hi, I am a returning customer to H&R Block but I have issues with this years refund. 1st off I know you offer a satisfaction guarantee so it made me feel safe "Your Satisfaction is Guaranteed Satisfaction Guarantee: If you are not satisfied, you are not obligated to accept and pay for the preparation of your tax return." I was told that since I was a prior year particpant in RAL that I would be approved for it. Since you now offer to do taxes for free on tax cut online I made it very clear that I only wish to get them prepared and pay exra money if you are sure I am approved for RAL and I recently had an Emerald Advance that will be coming out of my refund as well. At any rate, not only was I not called but when I called to check on my refund since I got an email saying it was submitted but when I went online it said it was only federal and not State, then I got another email saying refund did not go through I was concerned. My tax preparer said that yes I was approved and submitted for both federal an state but now not for RAL??? I was in shock since what was the point in paying when 8 - 10 days is same time frame if I did it myself? I was told specifically since I was approved last year they will approve me, then she adds that "oh maybe because you got eic you weren't approved" well then I asked why did you not tell me I may not get approved with eic if you knew i qualifieda nd prepared my return with eic? she had no answer to why she lied to rip me off. furthermore, I am not satified with your service and I HAVE NO NEED TO GET MY REFUND ON THE EMERALD CARD WITHOUT RAL!! It costs me more to withdraw, etc and if it is 8 - 10 days which the same it would have been if I did it myself i want it in my account and not on your card that did not approve me and I was fooled into paying fees for knowing with eic you don't get approved!! I want to know who to go to for this and I wish to have it rectified immediately. I do not know how this office is in the business of lying to get people to pay for things they know they wont get approved for. She knew I had eic and she knew that you dont approve for that regardless if I was approved last year and that is misleading and illegal! What I signed was based on what I was told and since you do have a "SAISFACTION GUARANTEE" all over your website I am choosing to exercise that guarantee right now unless you mislead with that as well. It is pointless for me to waste money on services that did nothing for me and I chose since I was lied to in order to choose it. Please respond asap. Thank you in advance for your time.
My story is much the same as all the others I have read! My husband and I went to H&R Block on Jan. 16th and filed our taxes. We were denied for the same day money but were approved - that is exactly what the tax preparer said, for the 1-2 day. Along comes that day and no money on the Emerald card. After an hour and much rudeness on the part of H&R Block I was informed it would be 8-15 days. That brings us to today. Our money is supposed to be deposited onto the card today. The IRS has specifically said the money is being deposited to this hsbc bank today and a rep. from hsbc stated to me that the money would be on there today. Well see. I will never, and I mean NEVER, go back to H&R Block again. Ill be doing my own taxes from now on. I know I wont be taken advantage of with these fees they charge, and will get my money in the same ammount of time! Because H&R Block told me that I would have my money in 1-2 days, I have now had to do an extension on my electric that will get shut off today if the money isnt deposited on the card, I am facing eviction because I informed my landlord what the H&R Block preparer told me that I would have it in 1-2 day (which was false), we have only enough food to last today and maybe tomorrow, no gas in the car. They have really made my life much more difficult than it had to be. If I had simply been told the truth from the beginning I could have planned in such a way as to avoid this!
On 1/28/09, I went to H&R Block in Oxford, MS to file my taxes as I do every year. I paid for the refund anticipation loan (RAL) as I do every year. I fully expected my money in 1-2 days. I, like everyone else apparently, was turned down for this loan. My problems with this are for one, I have never had a problem before, I paid a large sum of money (at least for me) over $200 for this convienience and none of that will be refunded to me, I'm sure. I haven't spoken to anyone, all I get is automated responses. The other thing is you can file for free online. I knew this. I went to H&R Block simply for the RAL and now I'm out over $200 and I still have to wait 8 to 10 days. I don't want to be angry with H&R Block, because the lady at the Kiosk was very sweet, but I was not told about credit or any problems that have been seen with this year's RALs. I will be complaining to H&R Block, Hsbc and anyone who will listen. I will not be back to H&R Block, I will do my own taxes, and file for free online. I hope everyone does, so they, like a lot of other companies, go out of business. You would think in this time of economic crisis, people would try to keep customers happy. Oh, one more thing. If they are getting my refund check directly from the government, why is my credit even a factor in this? It's bassically a payday advance. They're just trying to take advantage of low income families. Think they'll buy a corporate jet? My story isn't as sad as others, but I have 2 children and as a single mom, I needed this money now. Now because of my credit, my bills will be late, and therefore, worsen my credit.
This is in response to the H&R Block representatives that have come on this website to voice their defense of why so many people have been denied their Refund Anticipation Loan: It is a known fact that the majority of people who come in and are willing to pay the ridiculous amount of money it costs to file a return with Block are people who struggle to make ends meet and because of that, their credit may be less than perfect. The RAL's are aimed at this group, so therefore, if a company is to offer this service, they need to make it MORE THAN OBVIOUS that there are STRICT credit criteria that must be met in order to qualify this year. True, in past years, it's not been that bad. But to ridicule the people who depend on getting their refund back in a timely manner for having bad credit, when your company made no OBVIOUS mention in the apparent change of policy this year is completely unacceptable. H&R Block is taking advantage of the position the economy has put a lot of people in this year, and it would seem they are deliberately telling their tax preparers to avoid the is our credit checked question. Perhaps if Block would like to retain the customers it still DOES have, they should start being a bit more upfront about the fact that this is a loan that one should not apply for unless that have superior credit. RAL's would not exist if the only people that could attain them were people who have credit scores of 750 plus because those people could go to a reputable bank, and get loans at a decent rate, as opposed to the rip off that HSBC offers through H&R Block. a lot of people are paying huge tax preparation fees in hopes of receiving their money quickly, and are losing that money on top of not receiving their tax refund as quickly as anticipated because the company has changed the qualification criteria from previous years with no mention of this before you have signed on to have them do your taxes.
I have been doing my taxes at HR Block for a few years now and I have never had any problems until now. I applied for the RAL (1-2 day Refund Anticipation Loan) like I have every time and this year due to a simple address change they are not going to give me my money. Customer servic at HSBC (the HR Block bank) was extremely rude to me telling me that because I did not put my previous address down as a current address that my RAL had been denied thru screening process and I have to deal with it. Now they are going to stall before they give me the money that the IRS (the government) is refunding me in amounts more than $4,200. Now I have to wait 2 buisness weeks for the money that I am in dire need of that is owed to me. Several other people have experienced the same problem and there are numerous accounts of HSBC. Why do they even offer a 1-2 day RAL if they are going to deny every person, what can I do?
Well i always do my taxes with h&r block but this year seemed way more complicated than last. I still till this day love h&r block and the way they deal with their customers. I told the man who attended me thaT I needed my taxes as soon as possible he told me that i can have it within 1-2 buisness days but there was going to be a credit check and a extra charge of i think $60 if approved i told him that was fine and if i wasnt approved it will automaticly transfer over to 8-15 days and it will not deduct any money he also asked me if i wanted it in my emerald card and i told him yes but to my old one. I dont think i was approved since i can check my account balance of my card online and there is no money so now im just waiting
I filed my 08 taxes with them this year thinking that I'm going to get money within 1-2 days. I didn't. I understand it is due to my credit now but this should have been something that H&R block informs customers. I had a bad feeling when I walked in but figured I needed the money. Now I have to wait. I should have just did it myself. I new it. I feel that H&R block is not letting customers know the truth behind the bank. How can you advertise about filing our taxes correctly but yet lie to them in their faces and then not know what is going on but to hand out a 1800 number. Now I have to wait to pay bills and have to pay more interest. Not everyone can look on the bright side of things with the economy being like this. I HATE H&R BLOCK! Now I'm going to tell everyone about what has happened. STAY AWAY FROM H&R BLOCK EVERYONE, DO NOT GO TO THEM, THEY WILL CHEAT, LIE, AND NOT INFORM YOU OF WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW EXCEPT READ OR HEAR ABOUT IT LATER. I don't care about what anyone has to say about them. I don't care about how anyone says how good they have been to them. THEIR ALL THE SAME!
After reading through all of the above complaints related to H & R Block's rapid return problems/mistakes, I can honestly say..I've been there, and been there again...only by my own fault this time. I should have had my taxes done elsewhere or via Turbo tax for much much less of a cost. I had already previously a few years back went through the costly 1-day return and had been denied after thinking I was getting my return that day. I was then told by H & R Block that if you do not qualify for the rapid (same day) return then they do not charge all of the fee's associated with this loan. I was very upset at the time, but glad I was refunded the money. This year, I filed 01/27/09 (yesterday) and after having recieved a 1-2 day advance on my previous years returns without any problems, I assumed I would just go ahead and file for that again (as I did qualify previously for the 1-2 day return, the same day loan was what I was denied for before). Anyhow, after all was done, the lady already had discussed with me which type of refund I would be getting and I explianed I wanted the same 1-2 day as the last 6 years. When she completed the forms, the computer wouldn't give her the option to click the 1-2 day return. So she called the manager over to take a look as to why this was happening, and I was explained that if your refund is over $10,000. you could NOT get any loans or rapid returns on money. This should be stated somewhere. They should explain to people that there ARE MANY things that could interfere with you getting your return back rapidly..credit, the amount, etc. I couldn't believe this! My return was not much over this amount either. The OTHER thing was, I was told that I would be getting my refund in 8-15 days from this date. So, I inquired if my return/check would be mailed to me or what? and I was informed that No, your check will be printed right here at our office on Friday. As they stated that they recieve their checks from HSBC Bank every Friday and print them for pick-up. My question is (and I asked them this as well) If HSBC is printing my check or sending my check to be printed by H & R Block. why are THEY giving me a check if it is not going to be rapid 8-15 days later on a Friday? Why wouldnt the IRS/Government be sending me the check directly if my amount exceeded therir terms/requirements? I don't get it. So I asked how much is the charge and was informed it was only going to be $20.00. Why would my check come from HSBC if i'm not getting the loan? H & R Block didnt give me a good reason..the woman never answered my question directly. I was just tired and left. I coulnt deal with it anymore. Now I have to wait just as long for my refund, as I would have had to wait if I did them myself and was charged a total of $428.00!
I had my taxes perpared on 1/23/2009 at H&R Block after being declined the 24 hr RAL The preparer stated I would get the 1 -2 day refund. She even stated that she has hear that people have gotten that same night at about 9pm. So I checked my Emerald Card at 9:30pm and was given a operator to speak to who then gave me an 800# to call so I did and it stated I was declined for the 1 -2 day RAL. I was told I would receive a letter in 7 to 10 days explaining why. And I would get my refund in 8-15 days. I checked the IRS refund status website and they show I will have my refund in 8 -15 days. How did H&R Block get my refund any quicker. I then called the office where my taxes where perpared and no one could explain to me what was going on. The way it looks is I will have my money before the explaination. I feel I was mislead when I left the office I was assured I would have it in 1-2 days that is was already approved because there system denied me in the office for the 24 hr RAL. When you get your takes done they need to explain to you that you have to wait to see if you are approved in 1-2 days for the money not state that you will have it in 1 -2 days.
On 1-24-09 I walked into H&R Block as I have the past few years and sat down, got my taxes filed. I went for the RAL Loan as I always have. She told me that I would have my money on my emerald card in 2 days. 2 days later no money. I called them they gave mt the number to HSBC bank and I was told I was not approved! Not approved? I was never told I was gonna have to be approved. I called H&R Block and they said they didn't know why I wouldn't be approved. I am so mad. I payed them money plus extra for the RAL and I don't get the money for 2 weeks they said. It still hasn't reached the two weeks yet, so I'm not even sure if it will be there then. This is so wrong. I want my money back. I really have bills that are due and I was depending on H&R Block as I have every other year.
My wife and i went to our local office about six weeks ago to get see if we were eligible for an Emerald advance line of credit. A small loan to get us by till we filed our taxes. With this loan if you are not getting back atleast $1000 you are not eligible. To our surprise the tax professional, and i use that term very loosely, told us we were getting back around 1400. An estimate. We went to file our taxes yesterday, january 27th, and were told to our surprise that we owed both state and federal. I proceeded to explain our previous return quote and after having the numbers checked and rechecked was told that we actually did owe. The first representative, who is no longer employed with h & r block did the return incorrectly. I have to go back to the office on friday to see what, if anything, can be done about this situation. In this hard economic time it is difficult to take this kind of a blow. To go from expecting a 1400 dollar return to oweing on both state and federal. My life has pretty much been flipped upside down due the ignorance of this professionally trained employee. In a meeting i had with management a few hours ago i was asked what i wanted out of this situation to make me happy. I was asked, what do you expect? I expect this company who gives hundreds of hours of training to it's employees to stand behind that training and honor the return i was first told i was getting. Satifaction guaranteed. I have been physically ill since the news of this. I now have to completely change my financial planning and will likely lose some home ammenities due to this. Checks were written and bills were put on hold in anticipation of this return. It will take me months to repair the financial situation this has put my wife and I in.
I went to file my taxes yesterday, avter filing with h&r block for 12 years and was expectong to get the same day loan i have been getting since ot started. I was denied and told we would try for the 2 day loan, well this morning o call and i will have to wait the 8-15 days. my credit is better this year than last and i am totally confused and am looking at numerous bills not getting paid because i don't meet the criteria? nothing has changed and my credit score is higher. what criteria am i not meeting. not only will i use jackson hewitt or a cpa from now on i am NOW tellong all my friends family and employees to do that this year! i have a power bill rent and phone boll that i have had to get a loan to pay
The deception on H&R blocks part in getting you to pay their outrageous prices to file your taxes with the promise of a quick return. But after they e-file you and get your money their bank turns around and denies your loan with no explanation. This exact thing happened to me and i am absolutely furios. H&R block was told up front that if i could not get the RAL i did not want to file with them as i could go home and e-file for 20 dollars or so as opposed to their 400. the OFFICE MANAGER assured me that i had no reason to worry about getting the loan because it is not credit-based. They have your return as collateral. No risk... right? Now i am out their fee and i am still waiting 2 weeks on my return. i could have done that on my own. i think it is deplorable that a company can operate during these trying economic times, praying on the consumer. This in essence is robbery. if anyone has any advice on any recourse i could take please let me know. This should not go unnoticed or unpunished. i have a family to feed. My rent, insurance, power, water, and car payment will now be late, resulting in hundreds of dollars in late fees.
I filed my taxes on January 21st expecting to get the rapid refund. I was denied the instant and told it was just because I was a new customer but that I was approved for the 1-2 day refund on the emerald card. Find out friday that it was denied. and told to call HSBC was also told the same as many people that I did not meet the credit criteria? Whats this? The IRS money is goverment money and garenteed! Well today is the 28th IRS said my money was deposited to my card on the 23rd. Call HSBC and they claim there is nothing there. and that the irs did not relese refunds. OK so where is my money. Talk to the irs they say it was deposited talk to the bank they tell me I'm full of it. This is the last time I ever deal with H&r Block and any banking with HSBC. They cannot tell me where my funds are? Do you Know? My car went down a week ago I work in Crown Point IN and live 20 Miles away. Its a pain to get to and from work on top of getting my sick son to and from his dr aptments with out a vehicacl I was depending on that refund to either A. Get the car fixed or B. get a new vehical on top of pay off some debt that had payment arangments made based off of that refund. I had an unauthorized credit check ran not knowing it when I am trying to get financing for other things which messes with my credit score. Can some one explain to me how I tell my 6 year old diabetic son that I can't get him to the dr or get his medicine because the bank is telling me that they didn't receive my funds?
I also went into h&r block for a holiday loan and was approved for the 900.00. When I went back in to file my taxes on 1/26/09 I applied for the instant loan and was denied. I was then rold I could apply for a classic RAL and I would recieve the money in 1-2 days on my emrald card. Well day 1 went by and there was no money. On day 2 I got a call from h&r block stating that I was denied the classic RAL and it was because I was getting an extra 300.00 stimulus payment. They said that h&r block bank will deny any applicant that is recieving this kind of credit. I was told to come into the office and resign the loan documents without this stimulus payment on there. Just wanted to post this because so many people were being denied and they should check to see if this is the reason. H&R Block does know why and if they are telling you they don't they are either lying or stupid. I will say that when I went back in I dealt with another woman who was very helful and knew what she was doing. She told me that the man that the man who did my return to begin with made the error and should have known this would cause an issue with the loan.
i went to hrblock on 1/16/2009 to file my taxes. i have used this service for years and have never been denied a ral loan. i was denied in the office. i was told i would get in on my emerald card on the 1/19/2009. well i called it said i was denied. it would be 8to15 days that i would be refuned the fiance fees. i was also told that i would be getting a check instead of on my card so i threw the card away. what would i need it for. well i check the e-fine service through the irs 1/28/2009 and it stated that my refund was desposited on 1/23/2009 i call the hrblock office where i filed. they said it would be downloaded on th my emerald card. remeber i threw the card away. i was mis informed that i was to get a check. now it was suppose to be on the card on 1/23/2009 and it is not. no check either. irs stated that it was desposited. where is my money. by the way i had to order a new card overnight express 35.00 off my refund and after i ordered it the rep told me i should receve my card monday. what i just paid 35.00 for overnight express. what is happening to hrblock. i will never use them again. also the same thing happened to a friend of mine i have bills to pa. they rip off people. this needs to be stop. innonce people like myself have alot off bills to pay my gas bill is very high i dont have the money to pay it till payday next week. oh well from hrblock lesson well learned
Will i have been going to HR Block now for 3years. I have never had any problems till this year. I had filed for the RAL Loan 1-2 days. I recieved the loan in 1 day, as i was going over my taxes they had asked me did i want to put some money in my savings account. I was like yes i told them to put 1200.00 in savings and rest in the checkings and i left like that. Will when i checked my balance there wasn't any information about my money in my savings account. So when i called HR Block and the card number. Everybody acted like they didn't know where my money was. So when i called they 1-800 number this lady was like oh you get you savings money back 8-21 day. I put that money aside because it was for me to move and rest was to pay bills etc. Now i have lost the apartment that i was suppose to move in and i have two little girls. HR Block has cost me a great deal of stress and problems. I will never never never ever go back there ever again. I don't understand how people can act like that and not tell you about there policy and the crazy part was when i read over the contract and policy there wasn't one thing that said anything about my money that goes into my savings account being sent to IRS first. I'am truley thinking about getting a lawyer because breach there contract and just plain lied just get my money!
me and my husband went in to h&r block on 1/22/09 to file are income taxes. we went with 1-2 day's the charge was around $355.00 and the following morning 1/23/09 @ around 0911 i received a phone call saying that we would not be receiving it today that we would have to wait 8-15 day's i then proceeded to ask her why and she said that she was unsure. so on 1/27/09 i had asked my husband to go in to there office and try to find out what has been going on and are they going to write us up new paperwork and she had said not at this time.and that it was 100% h&r's fault. i just don't understand how they can get away with this? my husband asked them if they were still chargeing us the fee's and she told they will deduct around $61.99 so it is still costing us about almost $300.00. my husband has been out of work now since april 2008.and i am working a full time job to support are family we have six children and because of the lay off's at work i can no longer get any overtime so we were counting on a fast refund so that we can catch on are finaces. if i would have known this i would have went to a place who could help me file for free. please help! these businesses should have to stand by there moto's. they should have warned people what has been happening instead of scaming the people because they say come to h&r block and you got people or something to that nature. stop letting them get away with this.
I have filed rapid refund in the past with no problems or hidden surprise. This year I left H & R block with a smile of relief on my face.I went home and planned my expenses for the anticipated tax return (RAL) within 1-2 days. I called 1 day later and was given a 1-800 number to call and was informed I was declined the RAL loan. I my opinion H & R block companies are SCAM ARTISTS They do not inform you of the risks of approval or the qualifications. They just smile and send you on your way. We as tax payers have to pay this [bad] company to file our taxes...only to have them STEAL money from hard working americans. I will continue to investigate this in DETAIL! I cant imagine invading someones privacy without permission and providing mis-leading information to be legal. H&R block should be responsible for all the hardship and humiliation they have caused everyone who was made to believe the RAL was successful. WHERE IS ALL THE FEES AND CHARGES GOING TOO? This is Crazy. Anticipating money and adjusting finanical situations because expected RAL's has caused enormous additional debt. H&R block should be responsible for mis-representing. I have sent bills that NOW will not be covered because I was denied the RAL. The bank charges $30. for every transaction that is negative. right now I have 12. add this up. I struggle to provide for my children. I cannot afford to give my tax return to H&R block or the banks (due to fees)
my wife and i are recently married, and we have 3 young sons. we recieved our tax papers on friday, january 24 of 2009. we went that night and filed our taxes. we were given options on what kind of refund we wanted and of course most people want their money the fastest way. My wife and i decided on the rapid refund 1-2 days and instead of check we chose the emerald card. we were told if we were approved that we would get a portion of it that night and the rest of our money would be deposited on the card in 1-2 days. the tax advisor ran our credit and we were approved we walked out with a small portion of what we were owed. in 2 days time we called the card to see if our other portion had been deposited, and it had not been. i then called the hsbc (h and r bank) and they told me i was not approved for the second part of my return. they told me it would be 8-15 days before we recieve the rest of our money. from there i called h and r block and talked to their manager who informed me that it was the government that was the cause for the delay. But my actually question doesnt lay with the government my question is with hsbc. since we were approved for the rapid refund that night and walked out with money why werent we approved for the second part? we were not told you had to be approved for both parts. and does it not look like we could have recieved the second part simply because our whole refund was going to them so that it could be deposited on the card and they had paper work showing what our refund really was. so it wasnt like they didnt know how much we were supposed to get back and that they would automatically get their money back. another question that enters my mind is, could they be using our return to give to someone who has less of a refund or better credit? the stress and worry over this refund, being our first taxes filed jointly, has given my wife bad headaches and constant questioning over this years taxes. our delayed honeymoon was also delayed even more after we had already found a hotel and made an itenerary.
On January 23rd, 2009, I decided to use H&R Block this year solely to receive my tax refund sooner. I generally prepare them on my own, but like everyone else suffering with the economy, I decided the sooner the better. Well, when the tax session was complete, I opted for the Instant Money RAL , which I was INSTANTLY denied. So, I then opted for the 1-2 day RAL and figured, well 2 days isn't terrible. I was given the same options, check or card and opted for the card, The HR Block Emerald Card. I was leery to begin with about having quite a sum of money placed onto plastic, but I knew that my own bank would hold it for a while and really couldn't wait. I asked the tax preparer specifically if the transaction could be processed on a weekend and he assured me yes (which later after my own research, I found this to be false). I received the card and all instructions and I went on my way, happy that money would be here by Sunday. The lender used for this card is HSBC, which is a whole seprate financial nightmare. Ok, to the point, on Sunday, I checked the website for the Emerald card and it stated balance is $.0.00. I then called HR Block to ask what the problem was and she stated that the IRS HAD received/accepted my electronic return and that the HSBC bank said that the reason for my decline was an internal bank error. Being very unhappy with this as anyone would be, I went to internet and began looking for some answers on my own. So, what they are saying is my credit WAS ran, first of all without my approval, and it was then USED to determine my eligibility for a RAL. I called HR Block and they deducted $70.00 from my bank fee(s) which is really all that I wanted THEM to do, but I still have questions. Who do I blame here for not receiving my refund as promised in 1-2 days? Is this false advertising? Breech of contract? Misleading? What? Do I blame HR Block/HR Block Bank? Or is this the financial lender HSBC's fault? Needless to say, I am out all of the money for the tax prep and the Peace of Mind, what a joke, and the bank fees oh, minus the 70 dollars. I am still waiting for this money to just appear on the Emerald card whenever HSBC's fees like doing their part even though the IRS site stated: We have received your tax return and it is being processed. Unless we find mistakes or you owe other taxes, you should receive your refund by February 10, 2009. Now, that date would bring me to the 8-15 days that I would have received it to begin with had I stayed here in the comfort of my home and just had it direct deposited. Not to mention, is there no loyalty to customers anymore, the common man? The whole scenario has left a very bad taste in my mouth and I am broke to boot!
Ok LIke everyone else I went in to file my taxes 1/24/09. I was told I qualified for a RAL and there would be no problems. I have done rapid refund for 10 yrs with no problems. I wa then told it would be there within 2 days and paid the huge fee's. Like everyone has stated this has been a rough past year and this money was needed. SO I called and called but no money. I called H&R Block and they stated that I had been denied but din't know why gave me the bank number that I called and was on hold for 47 minutes. the got a stupid recording saying I didn't met critera... but nothing else. I alone am taking care of my father with brain damage. I needed this for care, medications and other needs. They screwed me royal and I will never be back.
Yesterday 1/27/09, I went to H&R Block and I advised them that I needed to the rapid refund since I am in urgent need of cash since due to an emergency. I made it clear that if I wasn't able to get it that I would do my own taxes as I normally to for free. They assured me that there would be no problems. They advised me that I qualify for the Classic refund anticipation which would be givin within 1-2 days. They never told me that a credit check done and it would be part of the process. They advised me that I would be given a call to advise the status. Today I found out I was not approved and no reason was given. I was furious since I was totally misinformed and mislead. I feel like I was taken for a ride and to top it off I paid way too much for my taxed to be filed. I would have never paid these fees if I would have known that a credit check was going to be performed. What a rip off. H&R Block needs to inform their clients that a credit check will be performed, but then again that's where they are making their money by misleading people.
I received the anticipation loan for the first time at the end of November. On January 5 I went into the same H&R Block office I have been using for 14 years and had my taxes done. I paid for their services and the 1-2 day rapid refund. I only received half of my refund. When I called the office I was told to take the first half off the card and the rest would be put on. I did that and was charged $20 by the card to remove the money. I called H&R Block and was told I would not receive the rest for 8-10 days. I asked for the 1-2 day fee returned since I did not receive my refund in that time period. This H&R Block is independently owned. The owner refused to refund that fee. The tax preparer paid me out of her pocket because she knew what happened was unfair. 15 days later I still do not have the rest of my refund and am being charged fees by the bank (which is H&R Blocks bank). The lady that prepared my taxes said there is nothing else she can do. The refund will come when it comes. I could have filed on line direct with the IRS myself and not had all these fees and headaches. I have used H&R Block since 1980 when I got my first job and this is the last time. They are nothing but scam artists anymore. Watch out nothing protects you anymore. I am interested in filing a class action suit. My tax return is being ate by H&R Block fees and hidden fees from H&R Blocks bank.
I have used H&R Block for 4+ years now in assisting me in filing my taxes. Every year I apply for the RAL as I use this to pay my daycare expenses for the year. I have never been declined this loan, until this year. I applied for the same loan and did not me the screening criteria. I was upset, I didn't understand why? I called H&R Block and they could not give me a awnser, they kept refering me to the 1-800# (which is an automated service and you can' speak to anyone. I became upset as I was getting the run around. I finally decided to go into H&R Block determined that they assist me. Afterall I was paying a pretty pennie in the first place, least they could do is give me the valid reason. I talked to the office manager, she said that I had been denied but didnt know why and that she would have to pull out her reason codes to determine. After 30 minutes of her searching she came back and said that it was a bank decision and to call them, she refered me to the automated phone number. I advised her of this matter and not able to speak to anyone. I then asked if they did a credit check, she was hesitant at replying but then in a soft voice said yes. I became very upset as when I filed my taxes the tax professional told me that the loan was simply based off of your refund not your credit? They are mis-leading and by not disclosing that they do a credit check is against the law. Loss of childcare due to not receiving the loan, I was unable to pay for my childcare bill. The credit check was done without my knowledge and they should have to be responsible.
H&R Block began taking care of me in 1969 when my husband was in Viet Nam. I had read articles about what records were necessary to file a complete tax return; I was self employed. I took all my paperwork into Block--on April 14th. They got me the best refund I had ever received. Eventually in 1984 I began to work for the company and with the exception of a few years when I worked for the Dept of Army, I returned to Block three years ago. The Refund Anticipation Loans were not originally initiated by HRB. However, the company began offering them due to public demand. Why are they so popular? Because so many clients are unable to pay for the tax preparation up front and apply for the loan where the fees will be withheld from their refunds. The RALs are bank loans with your anticipated refunds as your collateral. Tax professionals are well trained in appropriate presentation. I earned 75 continuing education credits this year. The average tax pro has over 1000 hrs of continuing education credits! I realize that many people who apply for these loans are low income families and they need their refunds. However, I suggest that they either have their refunds directly deposited to their checking/savings account AT NO ADDITIONAL FEE in 8-15 days or subscribe to HRBs Emerald Debit Card if they have no bank accounts, as is often the case. H&R Block is not responsible for tax payers poor financial management. As for the increased denials by HSBC Bank, one must realize that most of America's banks are in dire straits and are dramatically tightening up their lending practices. Your poor credit is YOUR problem, not HSBC Banks or H&R Blocks.
I went in to H@R Block to file my taxes,and was told that I was approved for a classic ral loan.I signed all the paper work and left same as I have done for the last 15 years.The next day at work I get a call from H@R Block that my loan was denied,and I wouldn't be getting my taxes till Feb.6,7,or8th hopefully. I don't understand.I asked her why in the world I would be denied I have never had any problems with my taxes before and I have always gotten them with the ral loan.She said she does not know they don't send that information they just deny it.I needed this money as my bills are all due.I could have just filed them myself and saved myself a lot of money if I could wait that long for the money,or filed through someone else that may have been honest and told me I was waiting for the money.
I have never used hrblock, or any other fancy tax company, I have always went through a personal tax preparer who works from her home. I decided to use hrblock this year for their RAL...which I have been recieving without any problems for the past 4 years..now all of a sudden I was denied, even though I paid those crazy fees, and now I have to wait. I could have prepared my taxes myself, had more money in my pocket, and waited the 8-15 days with no issues...Im ******, Im broke, Im never using them again....
Filed taxes with H&R Block on 1/24/09, was given their Emerald Card and told my funds would be on it in 2-3 days, maximum. I told them I needed those funds ASAP so I could fly to Houston for Cancer treatment. We applied for Classic RAL, which I easily received last year, and was denied this year. I was not told at the office that it was denied, I didn't learn that until today (1/26/09) when I was trying to be sure funds were on the card so I could book my plane tickets & hotel for Wednesday.
I went to h and r block the smae day that I went last year to file my taxes. I needed money for bills and other things so I went with the intention of getting an ral. I got one last year the day after I filed with no problems. WHen i went in this time I asked for same day, she said it would take 30 seconds to get approved. She said it did not approve for the instant loan but I would get it in 1 to 2 days. She said to check my card the next morning and it should be there. I did that..no money Later that night I checked my status online and it said I had been denied. I thought how can i be denied when she said I was getting it. She led me to believe that it had already approved me for the 1 to 2 days. I called her to ask what was going on and she said that it was just a computer error and that it would be here the next day. Another lie!! The next day I went to talk to the office manager and she said oh it sounds like a lack of training. But said they would not give any of the fees back that i paid. The only reason I went there and paid $310 dollars was so I could get the money I needed quick. Had they informed that the 1 to 2 days was tentative upon approval I would have never paid that money for something I could have done for free. THe manager was no help..no one from the district office has returned my calls..I am outraged. Oh and my preparer also told me there were no fees with the emerald card so i chose that. WHen i went to complain about all this they showed me a paper with a whole list of fees for the card. I cant believe these people can sleep at night knowing they are scamming people that are spending a ton of money just to get money they need to survive.
We filed our taxes on friday and were denied for the instant loan, we were told that we would then get the 1-2day loan.I asked when we would know... she said that our money will be on the card. The only way we would be denied if we owe back taxes or owe child support,etc... She DID NOT say that its based on credit AT ALL. I think that we all need to come together and file a class action law suit. Please e mail me if you would like to join me. I am LIVID about this situation.
On 1/23/09 I went to have my taxes prepared by H & R Block because I needed my refund ASAP this year. I have always used H & R Block for my tax prep, but have a friend that could do them at no cost for me this year. As stated earlier, I needed my refund ASAP so decided to go ahead and pay the outragous fees to H & R Block. Assuming I would have MY money in a couple of days, or less. The man who prepared my taxes was not very knowledgable, or confidant that he knew what he was doing...it took over 2 hours and I only had 1 set of W2s and 2 dependants. Ok, I dealt with that. We went over the UNGODLY fee of $212 for the preparation, and huge fees for the IRAL. Needing my money, I had him submit the form for IRAL.........guess what....I was denied. OK, I can deal with that...saved me a little money. After the deniel comment on the computer came another comment. That comment said I qualified for the RAL! Great!! So we got the Emerald Card all set up and I was told the money would be loaded in 1-2 days. I breathed a sigh of relief knowing I could get my bills paid, etc. The following day during my son's wrestling tournament, I got a call from the local H & R Block office to advise me I had been denied the RAL and that it would be 1-2 WEEKS before my money would be available to me. so I got screwed out of $242 by going to H & R Block for a service my friend could have provided at no cost. I really do feel H & R Block is becoming a scam. Their advertising lures people in and makes them believe their refund will be available to them very quickly. Most of us who fall for this really do NEED the money, why else would we be willing to pay such outragous fees??? Further more, most of us who need our money quickly have dings in our credit, so why get hopes up when you know you are going to deny us. On top of that, the money to pay back the loan is, for the most part, guaranteed...esp since H & R Block backs their services...right???
If you look at the HSBC application for refund anticipation loan page 5 on how we handle information we obtain it clearly states that: It is important for you to know that in order to ensure that our customers get the very best service and the highest quality products, HSBC collects demographic information(like your name and address) and credit information (like information related to your accounts with us and others) This information comes ether directly from you, for instance from your application and transaction on your account; or, it may come from an outside source such as your credit bureau report. in addition if you visit our internet web site we may collect cretin information about your internet usage.
Well i went to apply for the emerald advane loan for x-mas as I always do and was approved for the 700 line of credit. So when i go in with my w-2 forms being in the finacial state that im in plus needing to repay this emerald card advance go with 1-2 day return leaving not knowing that my refund could be denied. So when i didnt receive my refund at the accpected time I found out i was denied do to credit criteria that i did not meet not only did this further my debt but now i have to worry about the interest being applied to this loan that came from the same bank same credit from december-January nothing changed i have done the same thing for years i really wish i knew why from dec-jan i no longer meet the credit criteria ITS A SCAM AND A UNAUTHORIZED CREDIT CHECK AND A INFLATION TO AN ALREADY OVERDUE LOAN!!! I HOPE THAT NO ONE ELSE HAS TO BE DECEIVED BY THIS COMPANY I WILL NEVER COME BACK AND WILL SPREAD THE WORD TO FAMILY FRIENDS AND OTHER INDIVIUALS THAT WORK TO HARD TO FALL FOR ANY SCAMS OF H & R BLOCK...
I have been an H&R block customer for years now and I went in on 1/24/09 to have my 2008 taxes done. I had 3 documents to include in my return: stock receipt, W2 and savings account statement. It took 4 hours to complete my return and then I was told my request for an IRAL was denied. I was fine with the denial although I have been approved for twice the amount over the last 3 years! My major complaint is that the person completing my return had no idea what she was doing. I have never been as unconfident in the information being sent to the IRS as I did this year. At the end of the 4-hour "session", she asked if I was satisfied with the service and I answered no. She selected yes, stating my dissatisfaction came from things she could not control, and then charged me $125. After 4 hours and a huge headache later, I said fine, was advised my check would be there next week and left. I was not satisfied with my experience and it had nothing to do with things out of her control; it had to do with her lack of knowledge and obvious lack of training. I expect when I walk into a business that specializes in tax preparation, the tax expert handling my return will know more than I do. Several times I had to point out things I needed to sign or what she should enter on the form. I will not be returning to H&R Block and was unable to find a place to file a complaint on their website.
My husband and I went to H&R Block on Friday, Jan. 24th, to file our taxes. We were told we qualified for the Rapid Refund and we chose instead of the card to get a check. We were then told by the tax preparer to call back Saturday morning to see if our check arrived. I called at 10 am and the check was not there. I called again at 11:30 and was then told that the refund was denied by HSBC. I was given an 800 number to call, but it was only an automatic answering deal that said we simply did not meet their criteria. I then called H&R Block to ask when we would receive a refund and they told us it would be 8-15 days and to call back on February 6th. We have always filed for a Rapid Return in doing our taxes and have never been denied. We were never told that our credit would be checked or that it was based on credit. Otherwise, we would have never gone. Like many others, we have been hit hard by the economy and are struggling to stay afloat. Their lying to us has done more damage than they know, because like others, we promised money on bills that we simply do not have now. This was our first and last time we will ever go to H&R Block!
My wife and I went into H&R Block on 1-22-09 and filed our returns jointly and chose 1-2 days e-file to the Emerald Card. They called us back on 1-23-09 and said that our son's last name was incorrect on his social that we took the day before to the filer who filed us. Not our fault no.1. We got suspicious and started to investigate on Yahoo answer and question site to see how everyone else who filed before us were getting loyal responses based on their refund return. We come to find out that the tax preparer did not tell my wife and I that the refund loan was based on credit and could be turned down. I mean if they had told us that then, knowing what we know about our credit, we would not have filed yet. They are robbing low income families by not informing them of the correct information, so when whoever gets turned down, they don't get the filing fees back. They are forced to wait weeks until they receive their return. Our home in Tampa that we supposedly had gone to see was now giving up due to their lack of information because of their lack of greed and selfishness. They got their fees and the taxpayers are once again suffering.
Like all of you, my daughter filed her taxes with H&R Block and agreed to pay the outrageous charges only because she was told she would get an RAL in 1-2 days. Like all of you, she was denied this year after qualifying last year. She had received the Emerald Card loan in December 2008 for $400, but was denied the RAL once she actually filed her taxes (I was told by HSBC they are not the bank that gives these loans). The bank also said they "change their criteria every year." I was also informed that they have been getting so many calls "like this one" where people had been getting the RAL for 3-5 years and all of a sudden they were being denied. She filed a complaint by calling 800HRBLOCK and asking for client services. We did get a call back. The lady was very nice but not helpful. She started "complaining" herself about how hard it was for them trying to handle all of these complaints this year, and that this is the first year that the bank was running credit checks. We were informed that she will try to get some money returned on the cost to file the taxes. I suggest you all call 1800HRBLOCK and file a complaint! When my daughter was told she did not qualify for the instant refund, but did qualify for the 1-2 day refund, why was no mention made of the possibility of an 8-14 day refund (she would have left and e-filed herself and saved the outrageous cost of filing with H&R Block)? Now that H&R Block knows that credit is a major issue this year with the bank, are they informing their customers beforehand of this? I think a class action lawsuit needs to be filed against H&R Block.
I went to H&R Block to get my taxes done and get a refund anticipation loan. I was quoted a price over the phone of between $80 and $120 for their services (I have very simple taxes). I was charged $180. I was told I could get a refund anticipation loan and that I would have it in a few days. I did not get the loan. I have to wait for them to get the money from IRS and then process it through their bank and cut a check for me. It will now take me longer to get my money than if I had done the taxes myself. In addition, the person who did my taxes was very poorly trained. I spent half my time there telling him how to fill out the form. In addition to not getting what I went there for, I spend $180 for something I could have done myself better and in less time than they did. It would have cost me about $15 instead of $180. I feel cheated. I feel like I paid them for helping train their employee. The people in the office were very polite, but didn't really care about me as a customer. I think their services are horrible and that they misrepresent themselves to their customers. I'll never go there again.
I went to H&R Block on Saturday the 10th to see if I could get the Emerald Loan. It's been a tough year and I needed money quick! Well, of course since I have bad credit, I did not qualify. So I got my W2 and set up another appointment for the 17th. I saw the same lady and expressed to her several times I really needed the money fast! So we went through it and she came up with the same numbers I did on TurboTax; however, it was going to cost a small fortune to get my money in 1-2 days but I did not have a choice. So we filed and I am expecting the money to be put on a prepaid card by today actually. Well, the bank that does the Refund Anticipated Loan, HSBC, denied my loan! The bank can't tell me why, my tax preparer couldn't either, and I have no money. The tax lady did not express to me that there would be any issues with getting the money since they charge extra for it and my refund goes straight to the bank to pay my loan. There were no indications whatsoever that there was a chance for a problem. But guess what, now I have to wait until anywhere between Jan. 30th and Feb. 2nd. I could have filed through TurboTax for about $50. I paid H&R Block a hell of a lot more than that! So beware! I had to borrow money to keep my water on. My electric and gas will be shut off this week and I lost out on a piece of jewelry I have been paying for over a year because I couldn't meet the date to pay! I am so angry at this company especially after reading more on the internet about them. I would have gone somewhere else to get my taxes or just continued with TurboTax if they had been upfront with me. All they wanted was my money I paid them to file. I am so angry and in so much trouble financially and I blame them!
I filed and asked for the Emerald Advance for the first time in '07 (like the end of November or in December). I was just doing it to make sure Christmas expenses weren't such a burden. I didn't know anything about it but received an invitation (since I had filed with them before for paper, RAL and e-file) to file which stated the simple requirements that I met. I was approved for only $500 since it was my first time. That was fine. I was allowed the option of never having to actually send in a payment myself but to have it done automatic. Great, right? No! First off, I was only to receive around $479 on the card. My first payment was to be held so that I wouldn't have to send a payment in before my return was settled (perfect). That went okay. Money was put on card and amount held for first payment. Good. Well, I filed my taxes as agreed by the deadline (actually earlier) so that the remaining balance put on the card would be paid by due date and I wouldn't be responsible for mailing in a final payment for the remaining balance. I received my return amount by direct deposit. Everything was okay, so I thought. Wrong! Another option I got to pick was also supposed to be an automatic payment of that remaining balance due to H&R Block bank automatic (just like my deposit and at the same time) and H&R Block was supposed to hold out (get paid) their filing fees (they did). They held out their filing fees and the deposit did go into my checking account in January like it was supposed to. I thought this was a done deal. Nope! Remember, I received my return by direct deposit in January. I even had received a statement on the Emerald card showing a zero balance in February. The card account was supposed to have a stopping time before it could be used again and the balance would have to be paid by then (like an account closed then reopened). I was told this when I accepted the card because I was worried about a hit on my credit since my score was finally good and hadn't always been. I was even told this was the only way the government allowed the cards to be issued in this way and that they were not going to affect my credit in any way. I had already checked on the balance in January and was told I would get a statement in Feb. I was glad because I wanted something for my record that the card had a zero balance and that everything was complete. I was also assured that everything was completed. No more worries because I do not do credit cards or even have a lot on credit. This is the start of the nightmare story I have to share. I received a call telling me that there was a mistake and payment was not made for the final balance that supposedly had been deposited into my account at the same time I received my direct deposit. Please note this call was received for the first notification in April. No prior letter, a $0 balance statement in February. The young lady that called with H&R Bank said that I needed to pay the balance that I had agreed. Yeah, I've done everything I agreed. They made the mistake that months later I would need to track down before paying. I was asked if I wanted to pay by electronic check or debit/credit over the phone and I said, "You call months later after I've bought a house and demand your money that I'm not even sure I owe you or that you have a right to anymore. I don't have it and didn't make the mistake." I asked for paperwork and proof of what company she was. Now in January '09, I have seen a hit on my credit! Note, only one call since at my work and I told my story and was told to call back after they double checked their record since I would have to pay my bank to research. No further calls or anything in the mail until credit report issue!
I went to file my taxes at H&R Block. The only reason I did was to get the RAL. They said I qualified for a Classic RAL but they said the money would be loaded on my Emerald Mastercard provided by them. The money should have been on there by Sunday, January 19, but it never made it. After calling around to a few different phone numbers, I found out I was denied the RAL. Shouldn't they have told me that at the office? Well now, I have to wait 8-15 days and don't know that 100 per cent. I was relying on that money. I have done it previous years and had no problem. Now my bills are piled up and don't know for sure what's going on with my return. I wouldn't have had H&R Block do my taxes and could have saved $300-$400. If I would have known, I would have e-filed myself and saved all that money.
I filed my taxes like always on Jan. 16th. I did not qualify for the same day but was told I would get it in 1 to 2 days. Then Monday came around, the 19th, and I was told I was denied. What ** is that? I have never been denied. They said I would get it in 8-15 days. Something should be done about this. The HSBC Bank said something about I did not meet their criteria on the paper. What a joke.
I went on Sat., 1-17-09, to file taxes. I was told that I could get an RAL and then got denied for the rapid return but I could get the 1-2 days. They gave me the Emerald card. So far, I still haven't received a call from H and R Block. I got to looking on my paperwork and saw account number for HSBC. I checked on there and it said I was denied because of credit criteria with no explanation. They said I would receive it within 8-15 days. I don't have good credit but that never stopped me from getting my refund before the same day. I wonder if I still will get charged for those fees and will it still be loaded onto the card.
I went to file taxes H&R Block and get my RAL in 1-2 days. I was denied because the bank, HSBC Bank, is doing credit checks. We were never told this. I do have the HSBC Bank complaint number because they are denying this is going. The number is 1-800-524-0628.
I went to file my taxes with H&R Block on 01/13/09 using the Classic RAL and was told after my taxes were completed that the IRS will not begin accepting e-files until 01/16/09. At this point, I had no choice but to accept this and wait. I have always used the Classic RAL and would receive my funds within 24 hours of filing or even the same day for that matter. But this time, things were way different. Today is 01/21/09 and I have yet to receive my refund. Our tax preparer at the location in Kansas City, MO, Betty **, told me that the bank denied my Emerald Advance and the only reason they noted was denied due to internal bank issue(?). I was given several different numbers to call but got automated messages. I did speak with a representative of HSBC and she told me that the IRS placed a hold on my return, but as I sat there with Betty **, I saw clear as day that the IRS accepted my return. I told the rep this and she stated she needed to transfer me to a higher level department. Needless to say, I was transferred and placed on hold for over 30 minutes all while still sitting at Betty **'s desk. Finally, I gave up and stormed out of the H&R Block office. I feel I have totally been ripped off and now I have no idea when or if my return will come at all!
I got the Emerald Advance in December with no problems. Same as I have done for the past three years. On January 16, 2009, I took in my W-2 to file my return. My return is simple. I have a single dependent, I'm head of household and I don't itemize. I actually had my taxes figured out before I took them in, but I went to H&R Block because of the RAL they offer, and I needed money immediately instead of waiting 2 weeks. I was willing to pay the fees for this service. We got the taxes done and Carol pushed the button for the RAL. It came back denied, even though I've had one for the past three years with no problems at all. She told me the instant one was denied, but I could still get the traditional RAL. I received a call on Monday the 19th saying that was denied and I needed to call a number. But not to worry, my tax refund would come by February 1 and be deposited onto my Emerald Card. I called the number and they told me it was based on my credit, though I never signed a document agreeing to have my credit checked. Quite frankly, if I had known that this year they were basing the RALs on credit, I would not have done it. It's bad enough to get charged $155 to do exactly what I can do, but to have to pay it when you were denied a RAL, which is the entire reason I went there, is heartbreaking. I have been told by countless others that they were denied a RAL and the gentleman I spoke with at the number I was given by Carol said unless you had perfect credit, they weren't going to authorize RALs. When I pointed out that they weren't given authorization to run my credit, he replied it was too late and there was nothing I could do about it.
I was laid off from my job on New Year's eve due to the economic crunch of 2008-2009. I received a letter in the mail for an advance line of credit through H&R Block for up to $2,800 because I'm a preferred customer. I went to my local office to apply and to my excitement, was approved for a desperately needed $700. I was told my estimated refund for 2008 was $3,339, which I was also excited to hear. Well the time came to file my taxes, so I returned to the same H&R Block. After filling out the forms, I was told I owe the IRS $374 and would still have to repay the $700 advance. Bewildered and upset, I asked how could I have been approved for an advance if I wouldn't receive a return. I was told by the office manager that, "We're sorry for the mistake, but you're going to have to pay back the advance." I referred to their motto of customer satisfaction and we cover our mistakes up to $5,000. They told me that only applies to tax refunds, not the cash advance. I keep getting the same answer of we're sorry for our mistake, but you are liable. This is bold face robbery!
I went into my local office on January 15, 2009 to file my tax return. I was told that the IRS was not accepting any refunds until the next day (16th). I was told my refund was for $5,979 and I instantly applied for a RAL. I was then told it would be put onto my Emerald Card on Monday the 19th. When it did not show up by lunchtime, I immediately called HSBC (the bank that issues the money). I was told by automated system that I did not meet their credit criteria. I did RALs for the last three years and was never denied. Why this year, I don't know! I paid $302 just for the preparation and over $80 bucks for the loan. Now I have paid all of this money when I could have filed them myself for nothing. Mind you, this same bank, HSBC, approved me last year! I am no longer a client of H&R Block!
My husband and I applied for the anticipation loan and were approved. However, when we filed our taxes with them, we did not qualify for the same day refund or rapid refund. Hmm, this sounds like a ploy to stretch out the days between our loan acceptance and our payoff as to charge more interest! Someone really needs to look into these people. I have always qualified for rapid refund; however, this is the first year I applied for the anticipation loan. I would especially avoid the New Castle branch!
I decided to use H&R Block this year to prepare my taxes; I applied for the classic RAL and was approved. Today, I informed that I was denied by HSBC Bank. I had no idea that my credit was being checked, nor was I informed by the preparer. Thinking that I was going to be receiving my taxes today has put me in a serious financial bind. I think that it is very inconsiderate that my credit was run without my knowledge or my consent. I always thought that H&R Block had reputable circumstances; in this case, it's obvious that there is nothing reputable within their company. A few of my bills are behind; my rent is behind. My son has ADHD and he is off his meds; I buy his medication out of pocket. So now, I have to really make ends meet every which way.
Let me first start out by saying I have been using H&R Block for the past 8 years with no problems. I would go in for their RAL's (Rapid Anticipation Loans). Well this year, I changed it up a bit because I was short on cash. So I went and did the Emerald line of credit. The first day, 11/22/08, was horrible they were having problems with the networks. So I went back the next day as they asked. Well same thing, they said there was nothing they could do so they turned us away and told us all, all 25 of us, to wait for a call from them. So I waited for 6 days. They called me and told me I could come in the night of 11/29/08. By this time, I was about to just say screw it all. I just unfortunately could not afford not to go in. I was approved for $800 line of credit. That is not my issue with them. This year I did my usual, go in for the RAL on 1/16/09. Well everything pretty much the same way. I was told to expect my card to be loaded in 1 or 2 days. So 1 day goes by, well that was to be expected. I usually wait less than 24 hours most times. Well then Sunday, the 18th, rolls around. I log on and check my card status. Still no new monies put on it. I wait a few more hours. By this time I am getting worried. I call the regional office and they tell me, “Well this happens sometimes. Be patient it should be on there by this afternoon.” Well I wait watch the Card's go to the Super Bowl. I watch the post-game. Go and check my e-file status and card status. Unfortunately, your Refund Anticipation Loan has not been approved. Upon receipt of proceeds from the IRS, your refund will be deposited onto your H&R Block Emerald Prepaid MasterCard. The IRS refund deposit typically occurs within 8-15 days from the date your return was accepted. Please call again at that time to see if your refund has been deposited. For more information regarding your Refund Anticipation Loan, please call HSBC at 1-888-832-5625. Now I know this is a loan and there is a slight chance it would be denied. The thing is every year I do the same thing. I was approved for the line of credit. That was the only thing different. I figure they are making out like a bandit here. They will charge me interest for not paying off that line of credit, which will equal $40 by the time my taxes are returned. Then I had to pay the loan application fee, $29.95, on 1/16, their fees which totaled $281 for the preparation. On top of that, a prepaid finance charge of $53.37, the $30 for the peace of mind. $434.32 in fees, now I agreed to this, but when I was expecting the RAL to come through like it had year after year... until this year that is. I have heard stories about H&R Block over the years and have had friends tell me they were a joke. I did not listen to them and it has finally turned bad for me. This is my final year of using this company. They more than likely do not care being a multi-billion dollar company and all. I will go and pay my accountant friend $20 and be done with them. I just really wish they did not tell me to expect it in one or two days. It leaves me with a bitter taste in my mouth.
In the first place, I made an appointment in December '08 to apply for the Emerald Line of credit. I asked specifically if it was based on my credit because my credit was shot. I was told that that would not matter. I was denied and very sad. They encouraged me to come in on the 15th of Jan. as that was their first day to submit. I was assured that I would have my Mastercard loaded in the one-day method. Today is the 16th. I arrived at H&R Block today and was informed that they told me wrong and that it would be Monday, which is a holiday before any funds will be loaded onto my card. Now, you understand that I have made my living arrangements by the assurance that I would have my money. Everyone was very nice but let me tell you, I have been an account executive for 20 years and have filed the fast way every year. I don't know if they just didn't know that I wouldn't get my money in one day or what. I would have filed my own taxes and let them deposit it in my bank in seven to ten days. I paid a lot of money for nothing. I'm broke.
I found myself in a small economic crisis and decided to get the Emerald Advance from H&R Block. As so many others have stated in their complaints, there is absolutely nothing in H&R Block's advertising that indicates the Emerald Advance is a traditional loan. I asked the receptionist (the only employee whose name I neglected to get, as she went to lunch when I was denied) specifically what the criteria were for getting the Emerald Advance. She said it was based on the amount of my anticipated tax refund. I then asked Norma, the tax specialist, the same thing and she reiterated that it was based on the amount of my anticipated tax refund. This has nothing to do with the Emerald Advance, but just to show you how poorly-trained the tax specialists are, please note that it took Norma a full forty five minutes to complete the Emerald Advance form online! Bless her heart; she pushed the wrong buttons repeatedly, refused to listen when I gently and respectfully pointed out that she kept closing the screen by mistake, and then told me that she had been having computer problems all day. Darlene ** finally came over and showed her what she was doing wrong. I read each and every word of the six-page agreement for the Emerald Advance. There is not one sentence that states, nor even implies, that the Emerald Advance is a loan based on your credit score. Further, according to the Fair Credit Reporting Act (at least to my understanding), it is indeed illegal to pull a credit check on someone without their, his or her knowledge and consent. To top it off, none of the three employees at the H&R Block in Boiling Springs, South Carolina seemed to realize that what they were selling was a credit-based product. Even after the Credit Denied statement was printed, Norma, Darlene and Butch each argued with me that they didn't use my credit score, the bank did. These people really were clueless, so I called the District Manager, Jeremy ** out of Greenville, South Carolina to complain. He told me that his people had been trained thoroughly and that they certainly were aware that they were offering a credit-based product. He then told me there was nothing he could do about the waste of my time or my disappointment, but that he would give his Boiling Springs staff a good talking to. I think that others who have posted here are correct. H&R Block is taking advantage of people, knowing that the little people cannot afford to file a suit for fraud or false advertising. What does it take to start a class action lawsuit against a corporate giant?
I saw an ad on TV for up to $1,000 refund advance right now. I set up and appointment so I could get some money right now. So I went to my appointment and showed them my last paycheck stub. They went through everything on the computer and then they told me I was denied credit. I never knew I was having my credit checked. At no point in time did anyone say that it was subject to credit. I even checked on the website and double checked my paperwork and nowhere does it say that my credit was going to be checked. I believe that it is against the law to run someone’s credit without their knowledge.
There was a coworker who also worked at the H&R Block. She told me about the advance tax loans and she said that she would find out if I am approved. She filed in December of '06. She said that I wasn't approved. This year I found out that she took the money I was approved for. I went to apply this year and they said I have a outstanding Emerald loan. Now I need to find out how I can prove that she took my money and left me with it on my credit. I will be requesting information about that loan that was filed and will be taking her and H&R Block to court.
I went to apply for the emerald advance loan which I received no problem last year and was denied. They said it was due to the fact that I did not meet there income requirments. Those had not changed since the prior year when I received the loan I actually made more money this year. After thinking about it I thought maybe the woman had entered my info wrong so I called another office they told me to bring my stuff and they would reset my account and try it again well two weeks later I have heard no word from them and today when I tried to contact there office no one answers the phone. They clearly have their hours marked that they are open from 12 to 5 today so why is no one there to answer the phone. I will not return to hr block to have my taxes prepared this year I have already wasted to much time and gas with them.
I went on 11/28/2008 to get a RAL loan. The one named Peggy H. that was doing my taxes did not bit more know what she was doing in the man and the moon. She hit me square in my face with my check stub because we was joking around about someting which caused a great deal of attention and I found offense in their because what she did was not professional and she did not maintain herself as a professional tax preparer. She was slow and I really don't feel that she was telling me the real truth about my taxes. She was preparing the taxes wrong, putting in the wrong amounts and spelling my name wrong and I had to correct her several times on the mistakes that she was making which was a lot. She claimed that I was getting back $5,528.00 back on my income taxes and I was denied the loan and when I asked Peggy about this she claimed that she did not know and that I had to wait to February to get my taxes filled out. I fon't feel that I should have to wait when she did not have anything scheduled for the month of January. So when I got home something made me go and get the paper where I had been denied and it said that I was denied because of my credit. Well H and R Block should let people know that you have to have spotless credit before having someone go through the trouble and then not have the money to get Christmas presents, pay rent or bills or whatever else needs to be paid and with the economy the way that it is some get and some don't. I know for a fact that some of the people there had credit that was so jacked up that they could not get a crayon unless they could supply the coloring book and that is some bad credit my friend and I will not be going in 2009 to get my taxes filled out. That is false advertising to tell someone that they can get a RAL and then come back and say, "Oh I'm sorry but due to your bad credit report we cannot loan you the money," and they will get the money back when you file your taxes. That is completely a rule that they need to change. H and R Block have been known not to produce the goods and they should be closed down permanently if they cannot provide the good customer service that good taxpayers need to provide for their families. It is a shame that people work hard everyday every month every week day after day and then come in to their (H and R Blocks) office to get their taxes done and they get slapped in the face saying because of their credit. What the hell does my credit have anything to do with my taxes. If I am getting my taxes and I work and I am expected to received a W-2 at the end of the year and they change the rules without letting their customers know that should be a penalty against them (H and R Block) for not communicating with their customers, that is bull you know what and I am not going to say what I really wanted to since I'm Christian, but you get the message.
I had placed an order with ralphlauren but because the phone numbers didn't match up the transaction wasn't authorized. When I changed it so that it matched and then tried to resubmit the order, it still wouldn't authorize. When I checked my card balance it was minus the money from ralphlauren even though I was given the message that it was not authorized. H&R Block put a hold on the funds. I asked if the hold could be removed asap so that I could make my purchase for the holidays and I was told to call ralphlauren and have them fax over some information. When I spoke with ralphlauren, they spoke with H&R block who was unwilling to work with them to take the hold off. The were very rude to the customer service reps at ralphlauren. They were also rude to me when I called back, I was hung up on twice and I was told that I could not speak to a supervisor. Then I was told that the supervisors were in meetings, then I was told that the supervisor was on another call. Then I had a representative pretend they were a supervisor. Then I was told that the supervisor was going to tell me the same thing. I was given the run around and the customer service was terrible. I want to close my account and they won't let me. They won't take the hold off until January 7, 2009 AFTER CHRISTMAS! My nephew won't receive his christmas gift until well after the holidays. I missed the sale and the items will probably no longer be in stock and I also missed the free shipping promotion. Ralphlauren was so helpful but the customer service for H&R Block was terrible. They were asking questions and but responding with an automated service.
Every year I go to HR Block to get the Emerald Advance to shop for the holidays. I usually get approved for the max amount and pay it back with my refund weeks later. This year I go in for my Emerald Advance and I was DENIED by Experian Credit Agency. It said I was denied because the social security entered does not match the social security on file. Okay now I'm in shock. The tax advisor told me to get that straight with Experian and come back. I called Experian and indeed they had the wrong SS# on my credit report that they made the mistake and immediately DELETED it. I then went back to HR Block to do the advance and their software would not allow the application to continue past the old denial notice. I had the tax advisor call the IT department so they can re-set the application. The HR Block software department told me they have no problem re-setting this for me but all I have to do is have the District Manager submit a re-set email with my corrected documents from Experian (which i provided) and in a 48 hour turnaround time I should be able to have my application for Emerald Advance processed. Well after doing all this, now the District Mgr has not responded to the email I sent her, the 3 messages I left on the VM and I get advisors telling me HR Block has a new policy that they will NOT re-set anybody's application anymore even if it's not your fault it denied. I am furious because I use this money for holiday shopping and end of year bill payments. I don't know what the last word will be, but tomorrow Dec 12th 2008 the district manager is suppose to come into the office. If she submit an OK to the Software guys to re-set then I should be fine but I don't see any reason why she would not request a re-set. The physical damage so far is Experian making an error on my credit report that caused this problem and HR Block with this new policy to not re-set anyone's application even if it's NOT your fault.
My husband and I have been joint clients of H&R Block for six years. I have been a client even longer. Last year we applied for the Emerald Advance and was approved. We went back into the office in January to have our taxes done and applied for the instant money refund and was approved for that too. However, because of a prior year mistake on our taxes, (my fault, not H&R Block, the irs held our return for quite a long time to repay themselves. Finally, after the IRS was done, they sent the rest of our refund to H&R Block. H&R Block then took out the fees we owed them for tax preperation, the prior advance loan plus interest accrued up to that point, and monies we had recieved for the instant refund. No harm no foul, right? Wrong, they took out their portion and distributed the rest to us on our Emerald card on March 11, 2008. Later that month I recieved a notice stating that our emerald advance had never been paid. When I explained to the woman that I called on the notice that it had been paid late but still paid on March 11 she said that it just had not been updated in the computer and it would be fixed. Just to point out, even though it was late, they took out late fees to that point before they gave us the rest of the money. So I thought everything was fine and they would fix it. So last week we go to H&R Block to apply for the Emerald Advance again this year and are denied. We recieve a paper that states we have problems with H&R Block bank. However, no one can explain what this means. I have been calling for a week and no one can tell me what is going on. We had over four hundred dollar line of credit on our card because my husband had used direct deposit so we tried transferring that to our card and was unable to do that either. After being transferred on the phone to three different people today I was finally informed that we can no longer access that line of credit because we owe sixty five dollars to H&R Block for fees incurred on our previous years advance that was after the date they distributed the remaining funds to us, March 11, 2008. She told me she would send a claim to the bank to ASK if the fee can be removed. I asked her why do I have to ask to have a fee removed that I do not owe and she stated that I do owe it because the IRS did not send the money to them until March 14. Let me get this straight, how then would they be able to distribute the remaining funds to me if it was three days earlier and if that is the case that they can do that, how could I accumulate sixty five dollars in late fees for three days? I am so disappointed in H&R Block as I have been a loyal customer, whom of which have referred to them several new customers over the years, and always got the instant money loans and such which lines their pockets even more. Now I am not eligible to reapply for the Emerald Advance this year which we really needed for Christmas because work has been slow for my husband. Also, they told us if we used direct deposit for payroll we would open an advance line of credit year round, so my husband did this last year knowing that it would cost us more in the long run because of ATM fees but because we would like the cushion for emergencies. We never touched the line of credit all year long, now that we need it, they closed it down and will not let us access it because they messed up and charged us sixty five dollars for nothing. So we lost money on every aspect.
I went in to get my anticipation loan for the holidays, like ive done since i started filing my taxes, and they told me I was denied based on my credit score which is just as bad now as it has been for the past 6 years ive gone through them for this loan. Ive never not paid them and ive been a loyal customer for a long time,or was until now. I depend on this loan every year to pay for christmas presents and pay off bills but I was screwed this year by their change of policy even though they told me my return was 6000+. Which makes no sense considering they get the refund before you do and its paid to them first! Im am outraged and insulted and am telling everyone i know to boycott this tax preparation place permanantly. I thought they cared enough about their customers to at least warn them first of their policy changes. I wont have money to buy christmas presents or pay bills and i might end up losing my car.
I went into the H and R Block office expecting to get a holiday loan like others out there where it said just bring in your W-2 I had done this a couple of years ago and recived 800.00 for Christmas, first off they didnt say anything about credit checks, or anything else that would be checked, when I was dfenied I asked the guy why? He said well maybe its because you employer is in Ohio, or you tax return ion Januarty isnt going to be big enough he couldnt or wouldnt give me a straight answer. Waste of time and gas, counted on it to pay for bills and Christmas like we had previous years, and now bills are late and no Christmas for the kids like expected.
I went to appy for the loan they are advertising up to 1.000 This year I went to apply for the loan for up to 1.000 dollars turned down because of credit report.Now I want be able to pay my rent as I have only had one day of work this week.I have had my taxes done at the offices the last 5 years. They should have told us that we would not get the loan with out good credit.Read there web site it dose not say anthing about doing credit checks. Also I got the loan last year. When they did my taxes paid the money back.they have lost me.I will use Turbo tax this year
I went to H&R block in November to get the Christmas loan, like I have in the past and like many others I was denied because of bad credit. I don't understand what good the loan is if no one can get it. If I had good credit I wouldn't need it. I am a single working mother who was depending on this for my children's Christmas. It seems like the only people who aren't getting denied are the ones that don't need it. H&R Block has been doing my taxes for at least 10 years. They have really let alot of people down. It's not like they won't get their money back when taxes are filed. I am very disappointed and like alot of others don't think i will go back to them to have my taxes done again.
I went in on Monday evening at 5:30 12/1/2008. I asked several questions about the Emperial Advance for current and new customers. Never once was I told they base this on my credit but I was told it was based on the Tax Refund I was subjust to get back for 2007 year. I waited over an hour to be told that not only could they find me as a customer but my credit was to bad to even issue a line of credit for $500.00. NO WHERE IN ADDS does it state anything about credit, just the tax refund that you would be getting back. I was told I was getting back $2500.00 but in the same breath i was told I had been declined. I will not be doing my taxes with HR Block anymore. I feel very cheated as a customer. This money was to go to help pay rent. I have been behind and wanted to get caught up so my son and I would not be evicted. I do not understand if this is based on my refund why I was still declined?
I got on here last night reading stuff about hr block emerald card, we did the early loan 2 yr ago and it was a chack then, anyways after what i read on here i was really upset, I was so worried we wouldnt get appoved this year and kids would have nothing for christmas. We went to hr block this morning and we were approved!!! The lady said so many people had been turned down and people were calling & she would tell them wait till first of dec, the system had bugs to be worked out, it was turning everybody down. i just wanted to let people know my credit sucks and i was approved (Seriously started not to even go after I heard they did credit checks) Maybe you guys that got turned down could talk to someone and try again. Good Luck
Every year I get my taxes done at h&r block bad enough I get ripped off having it done I also get the christmas loan every year and they collect it back from my taxes this year I went to apply for the loan and got denied because now they say they do a credit check why do a credit check if there gonna take it out of my taxes anyway so now the christmas loan I usually get I can't get it So now my children won't be getting to much for christmas because h&r block and they have the nerve to say it not there fault that it has nothing to do with them then why do I gotta go to there office to apply its a shame there a rip off and it stress me out so bad that I had and anxiety attack over this I hope they lose all there customers I pray for the worse on h&r block for doing what they did to me and took away from my children and ripped me off all these years ......
Well to all those who didn't get this so called great line of credit find yourselves lucky!!! This was all bull put on by H&R Block. They say one thing and deliver a totally different thing. I was approved for this line of credit advance, however once it was done I was given an immediate line of credit and was told the rest of my funds would be available within 72 hours. So once my 72 hours were up I called to transfer the remaining funds and in a week I have not been able to transfer the funds, however H&R Block is taking their fees out of my money. I will NEVER return to H&R Block no matter what the circumstances !!! Yeah thy make it look good and promise you all this stuff but its never true. So if you got turned down because of bad credit like I said consider yourself blessed. Because Im sorry in my eyes all H&R Block is doing at this time is screwing with my credit what little I have. I find it very funny a company this big has had computer problems for over a week, in fact one of their own employees told me that they hadn't even been able to be paid in over 3 weeks. Makes me wonder about this company.......
totally let down this holiday season by h&r block.always approved for seasonal loan- not this year! counted on this loan to catch up bills. sorry kids -pretty sad christmas this year. counted on loan to catch up bills in time for christmas.now we are just trying to keep our home and keep the lights on
Well, there will be no Christmas this year due to the Line of Credit Advance. I'm in the same boat. I have been an H&R Block Customer for over 10 years. I received a Loan from them last year with their "Phony" Line of Credit. It wasn't a line of Credit at all. Once it was taken from your refund, you could not pull the money back off. That's why they have the credit checks this year. Because a credit line is something you can keep taking the money from once you have paid it off. Well, they screwed up last year and I see a Class Action Law Suit coming their way. They are trying to fix what they did with their false statements and it is hurting many people who depended on this loan for Christmas. Hey, at least Jackson Hewitt has a Money Loan Now program and a Credit Line and they tell you up front if they are going to ***** *** over. I even received the letter in the mail from H&R Block to, "Come on in and let us help", NOT! They also didn't say anything about credit checks because I called first before driving 1/2 hour to their office only to be denied. I will never, ever use H&R Block again. Do yourself a favor, file your taxes online with the IRS.
hr block offered the holiday loan this year. a loan that i can borrow off of my taxes that i get back at the beginning of the year. went to our local office and did all the paper work as we would any other year that we have received this loan, we were denied!!!!! what? that is my money that i'm trying to borrow. they now do credit checks. i've never heard of such a thing. they give no reason but a paper to call a number that is on it, well i've been trying to call that number for 4 days, and guess what? nobody answers. i, and probably alot of other people like me count on that holiday loan. hr block is wrong for doing this to people. ive been their customer for over 15 years and i also use their emerald card for all my direct deposits from work. i will go elsewhere to have my taxes done and as for my emerald card, consider it closed.
I have been with H & R Block for several years. I have gottten the emarald advance 2 years in a row. When i went yesterday i was sure i would be approved, as i was a returning customre. Boy was i fooled. DENIED. Reason---Now they run credit checks. Well my credit is not the best. If i needed a loan based on my credit i would have went to a loan comapny to be denied. I called before i went to see what the requirement were. I was told. As long as yu have grossed over $10,000.00 you were good to go and again i was a returing client. When it was denied that is when the TAX PRO decided to state that some things have changed and now they run a credit check. I asked her didn't she think this might have been somthing to tell me on the phone before i drove out of my way to get there. She had no answer. I told her that this is what i do a portion of my christmas shopping with. She stated that it was not there fault it wasn't them it was the bank that they are going through. She then had the nerve to ask me if i have paid back the last loan from them. I quickly informed her that it was deducted from my refund before my check was even cut. I will be at Jackson Hewitt this year and the years to follow. The hell with H & R block--they have lost this loyal customer. Well now my kids will not be able to get as much as they usually get for christmas. There will be no Dora ride on or 4 wheeler for my son.
For the last two years, I have gotten the H&R Block advance to help with the holidays. I have always paid them back on time and have never had any problems. Unfortunately, because I am a lower income single parent, this is my only option for help during the holidays. I get a large tax refund but that doesn't help me in December. Now, H&R Block runs your credit and I was denied for credit even though I am in good standing with them. They did not advertise this and on their website they only say that you must meet requirements. I have always met the requirements so why would now be different. When I called another office just to see what they would say about the requirements I was told that I had to have a job (which I do and plan to keep) and I must have a tax return over $2000 (mine will be about $6000). Those were the only requirements that I was told to meet. It was bad enough that they didn't warn their customers about their economic stimulus checks but this goes beyond that. I was going to pay bills with this money and now I can't. Now my children have little to no chance of getting anything for Christmas. I didn't see any reason that I would not get the loan since I paid the other two loans on time and I got them before.
i was in hr block to get the emerald advance loan that they have everyyear,take in mind that i am a customer that have been filing with them for over ten years ,i have also i always paid back my loan through them ,but this i was turned down because they decided to run credit checks, now i feel they are very wrong for this there were 15 others beside my self that were turned down do to credit ,they have truly lost my bussiness for this year and years to come ,i am telling everyone i know about this .... and not to file with them i called this hr block number they give you to call u are on hold up to 2 hours and still don't get threw.
Went and applyed for Christmas loan, got turned down because of credit. Have been a customer for 11 years. And have gotten the Christmas loan 2 years in a row. We look forward to this loan every year so our kids can have a nice Christmas. But that got shot this Christmas. I have always been a loyal customer, always paid the Christmas loans back out of my taxes and this year didnt get approved. Im very dissapointed with this.
In Dec. 2007, H&R Block sent me a letter with an offer to get an H&R Block Emerald Advance Card, which allowed me to get $500.00 on a Debit Card right b4 Christmas, that sounded great, and this money can be retained and paid back by having it taken from my income tax return in Jan 2008. So as usual, I fell for it, come January I filed my taxes and the documents I signed stated that H&R Block will take this money from my refund and may this $500.00 off. It is now April 2008, and I have been getting statemnets in the mail from H&R Block not only showing the $500 still owed but also 35.95% annula percentage rate interest, over limit fee of $50.65, late payment fee $7.95, so now my balance is $550.65 and growing. I called over 5 phone numbers for H&R Block and they are telling me that the money never was taken from my refund, and that it was directly deposited into my personal checking account as was my Tax refund and this was caused by a glitch in H&R Block Computor System and they apologize but YOU ARE STILL LIABLE TO HAVE TO PAY ALL THE FEES sorry for the inconvience. I was told this happened to alot of H&R customers so looks like they will be making out like bandits, H&R Block should be sending letters to those who took out those advance loans apologizing of on there behalf and reassuring customers that they will not be responsible for all of those fees, interest and late charges. It is unfair to the consumers. Help. H&R Block is making alot of money from consumers becaue of a computor clitch. I have 2 case numbers open with 2 different H&R departments, I got no where when I called the office that did my preparation, the manager said honey just pay it all off, so your credit does not become effected with negatives WOW! to think I patronized this H&R office for over 10 years.
I was approved for a ral from h & r block and hsbc bank. After being told I was approved, hsbc then tells me I am not approved because I owe the irs. I have called repeatedly to hsbc, irs, dept of treasury, and h&r block with no resolutions. There is no money offset, my loan was denied due to incorrect information and the bank or hsbc bank will not correct their mistake! I have spent over 48hours on this. I am a single parent and my electricity is going to be turned off 2/6/08 and my rent is late leading to possible eviction.
I applied and was approved for a 1-2 day RAL to be deposited on an Emerald Card. Two days later after many calls to check card for loan I called the office and was given an 800 number to call. All it stated was that I was denied--this has never happened in all my years of dealing with H & R Block. The recorded message said I would receive my refund in 8-15 days. I called the office back and asked for a refund on the RAL loan and said it wouldn't be refunded but they wouldn't charge me interest! What interest? I'm paying a loan fee and interest for something I never received! What is going on here?
After almost 20 years of doing business with this office, this year has been a nightmare. My loan for some reason was denied after several years of no problems. The H&R Block company had no idea but provided me with an 800 number. I called this number and a lady read word for word a bunch of jumble basically stating she could not tell me anything! Stating that I would be sent a letter. I paid to have this RAL and now I am not sure what I am paying for besides a scam. I was told it could take 8-15 days whereas there is nothing rapid about that! I am a single parent who needed that money for college expenses and other bills. I went to the IRS.gov site and was unable to find anything either..have no idea what is going on.
I have been going through H&R block for about 8 years now. I have never had any problems and have always used the anticipation loan. I also did the 500 dollar loan with the emerald card before Christmas this year as well has last year. There didn't seemed to be a problem until yesterday, when I checked my balance and noticed I was missing $517 dollars and some change. I called the 800 number to find out why and the lady told me I would get it back in 48 hours. Evidently, the bank with the emerald card hadn't received their money from the IRS yet so they decided to borrow some money. I did get it back but it sure has made me nervous. because they have shown me they have access to my card anytime and can take out money when they feel like it. Is this LEGAL? I was planning on having my paycheck direct deposit into this account. I don't think I will. As soon as I got my money back I went to an atm machine and emptied it out. I just don't understand how they could get money off your card when they want - to me that is stealing. Of course when I borrowed money from them, I had to pay a fee, what about them Paying me a fee when they borrowed from me with out my permission?
We went to file our taxes before Jan 13th of this year (the day the IRS was to be receiving returns). The tax professional filled out the forms, and we asked for the RAL and also $300 H&R Block Savings Account. When we went home I was comparing this year's return to last year's return when I noticed a mistake with our deductions. I immediately called the H&R Block office and spoke to the professional that served us and explained the error. She said it wouldn't be a problem because our return hadn't left their server yet because the IRS wasn't accepting returns until the 13th. She said she would call to let us know if she could pull it off the server so we could bring in the corrected information. She said she didn't know if it could be pulled. We called over the next week or so and left many messages for her to call us back. Finally after about 14 messages she called back to tell us that the return could not be retrieved and that we'd need to file an amended return. Then on the day our RAL was to be there, she called to tell us we didn't qualify for the RAL. (We've used this service for the past 3 years, and it was never a problem.) She said we'd have to wait for standard IRS processing. We received an e-mail on the 30th of January from H&R block that our refund was in and posted to the emerald card that was given to us for the RAL and the $300 savings account. Unfortunately, we had left our tax papers in the H&R block envelope which was left in our vehicle. My wife had thought that I had put it somewhere, and I had that she had put it somewhere so we didn't notice that someone had taken it from our vehicle. All of our tax money was taken out of the account on the 25th of January--5 days before we received an e-mail from H&R Block and probably before the envelope was taken. So then we think at least we have the $300 in savings. So my wife attempts to call the H&R Block bank which is on the East Coast somewhere, and it takes her about a week of calling and hours on hold to find out that the $300 hasn't posted to our account. They can't tell us why or where our money is. On top of that H&R Block still took the fees out of our refund for the RAL which we didn't qualify for. Who's the bigger crook? The person who stole the envelope from our car or H&R Block? My guess is H&R Block because they are more than likely doing this to hundreds of thousands of customers!
I went to get my taxes done on 1/15/08 at H&R Block. The lady that does my taxes there is wonderful and has been doing my whole family's taxes for a couple of years. We get halfway through my taxes, and I'm told that we cannot proceed because of AMT and the form that is needed has not been released by the IRS and I'll have to wait until Feb. 11th to file my taxes. I was told that it was something to do with the tax bracket that I fell into and the credit I was getting for claiming my tuition. So on 2/11/08 I go back to get my taxes done, and like every year I get the instant loan that they offer. And was DENIED. No explanation was given, but I was told that I was approved for the 1-2 day loan. Which was fine with me. So I decided to get one of those Emerald Cards, because I was expecting $4000 back and my bank always holds the check for 7-10 business days. Well I check the status, today since its been more than 1-2 days, and I learned that I was denied do to pre-screening. Now I have to wait 8-15 days. But was assured that I would be refunded the fees from HSBC. We'll see.
I filed my taxes yesterday. I have been going to H&R Block for over 10 years. I opted to have my refund deposited to my emerald MasterCard offered by H&R block. I am a single mother of 3 and so I needed the anticipated $ fast. I chose the 1-2 days RAL. I have never been denied for and RAL. Ever! I called this morning to see if the funds had been added to the card to find that I had been denied for not apparent reason. I called my local H&R block tax preparer and he had no answers for me. I asked about the extra $ I had paid to have him do the RAL and he said I would still have to pay the fees minus the bank finance charges approx. $50.00. I am shocked! I spent the extra cash I had to pay my bills and now have zero $to make it till my next payday let alone till the refund gets to me. The automated systm tells me the IRS will release the $ to the bank in 8-15 days. I will never use H&R Block again. I was never told that I may be denied. I was scammed and so were a lot of other people. There must be something we can do. I have no $ for gas or food to make it till my next payday or till refund gets to me I can't even take my children to school 20 mins. away. I am so screwed!

My income taxes were completed and i paid for the emrald mastercard. I was told by the tax rep that the funds would be on my card no later than 2-12-08. I then called because the funds were not on the card and i was told that they made an error on entering my information. They completed a R.A.C. instead of a R.A.L. The manager there refused to assits me with this matter. I was given a phone number with no reuslt. This has caused great financial strains on me. This will also bring more debt to me.l
My wife and I filed our tax return several weeks ago. We were supposed to have our money on the 8th of February. We purchased a car with the contingency that we would put $2,000 of our return on that vehicle. The funds were to be direct deposited into our account, but our bank refused the payment because we used my wife's checking account, and H&R Block put the deposit in my name ONLY. We filed married and jointly. I spent all weekend waiting in hold for a total of 5 hours across Friday, Saturday and Sunday trying to get in touch with someone to help me remedy this situation.
My husband and I are tight, money wise and needed our tax refund right away. We have always prepared our own taxes, but I figured if H & R Block could give us the RAL that the need outweighed the cost. We had our taxes prepared and we were approved for a 2-day RAL. That was January 15 - it is now February 11 and we have not seen a dime. The manager will not return my calls and the receptionist just hung up on me for asking to speak to someone else. This has to be the most rude bunch of people I have ever not had the privilege of doing business with. Our house is in foreclosure.
I used H&R Block years ago. Never had a bad experience, I would go there, and they would electronically file my taxes; and I would usually get my refund back in 2 weeks. I started doing my own taxes for the last 10 years or so; I would fill them out and then have my funds electronically deposited into my checking account. That process always took about 2 weeks, sometimes sooner depending on when I filed them. This year, my husband and I thought we would go to H&R Block so we could get our money back sooner. I will never go back again; the tax preparer we had (someone with over 20 years experience) barely gave us any information. She rushed us through the whole process. Thank God I have tax experience because I was asking the questions, and she seemed irritated with me. But I am the paying customer, why should I not ask the questions, and shouldn't she be informing me? Anyway, we paid all of the fees for the RAL loan to get our money back in 1 to 2 days; she never told us that you had to get approved for it. I asked her at the end, and she said you do, and if you get denied it will automatically take 8 to 14 days. If I knew this right off the bat, I would have done our taxes ourselves. From reading everyone's complaint, I think this RAL is a lie. Do you know anyone who has been approved for it this year? My husband and I have good credit and we don't know why we would have been denied. If anyone would like to put together a class action suit against H&R Block, please include me. It is going on 10 days now and no check yet. Wen we call to see if it came in, they are rude to us on the phone and say just call the 800 number, and it will provide you the information you are looking for. I will never use them again. We weren't totally depending on the money; but paying almost $300.00 for that service, I could have done the taxes myself and got the refund back in no more than 14 days--and would have had $300.00 more to our check. I am completed dissatisfied with our preparer. She was rude and rushed us through, and the fees are outrageous. We just went to them to get it back quicker, but they need to inform their clients a lot better than they are doing. They need to inform the clients up front about the RAL, and then give the person the choice to either go through with the process or not. Because obviously this year, no one is getting approved for that RAL, and it is obviously a SCAM.
We filed for the RAL at HR Block at 10 am on a Saturday. We paid the $50 fee + 29.95 fee + 20.00 fee because we chose to get a check instead of the prepaid mastercard. By 5 pm that day, the office had already called us and we picked up our check that day. I was concerned by all of the negative experiences I read re: the RAL - but was pleasantly surprised when we received our check the very same day. I'm not sure why others had such a problem.
H&R Block prepared my taxes yesterday and talked me into the RAL. After I reviewed the paperwork at home, I decided to cancel the RAL, which was less than 24 hrs. later. I spoke with H&R Block (Dan Hodgekins), and they refuse to allow me to cancel the RAL--even though the loan agreement that I signed said that I have 48 hrs to cancel. This is a total scam, and they are taking advantage of lower income tax payers. Dan's statement was to go ahead and sue, H&R Block has all kinds of attorneys--knowing that I probably couldn't afford to go against them. Any help would be appreciated. H&R Block charges outrageous interest rates and fees for RAL and does not give full disclosure on options.
Do not put money into the Emerald Card Saving Account. The IRS is not paying out to them at this time (and who knows when they will?). I went into H&R Block to file my taxes like I have for the past 5 years. I have always had a great experience with the company and the employees who have assisted me. My most recent experience with the company started off no different, up to the point where I found out that the money I took out of my refund, to put aside to go into the Emerald Card Savings Account, was no where to be found. I had a receipt from the H&R Block office stating that the money had been taken out of my full refund to be put into the saving account; however, when I called on the card to make sure everything went through from the RAL, I was advised that there was a zero balance in the saving account. I was irate and concerned at this point; where could my money be? I called the number on the back of the card, and after waiting 15 minutes to talk to a human representative about the issue, I was advised that the IRS was not paying out to the savings account at this time because it was on hold. The rep also advised me that if I didn't see it in there by Feb. 29 to call back. (Ya, and wait on the phone for another 15-20 minutes to talk to someone?) At this point it has not caused me any financial upset, however it is just one more reason to prove my beliefs that the IRS does what ever they want when it comes to our money at tax time, and we have no control over it. They are the ones who set all the tax deduction amounts and they take as much time as they want to get our money back to us, that is if they even want to give us our money back at all. That is my money; I was one of the lucky ones that got approved for it, and I want it where it is suppose to be.
I have been using H&R Block off and on for ten years. I am capable of doing my own taxes but use Block so I can get my refund back faster. On this occasion I was told by the preparer that I may be able to get the IRAL which would give put my refund on the emerald card in 1 to 2 hours. The computer then stated that I was not eligible for the IRAL but was eligible for the classic RAL which would put my refund on my card in 1 to 2 days. So, I agreed to pay the fees to have it in 1 to 2 days. The preparer told me to call first thing in the morning, and my money would be on there; if not it would be on there by the end of the day. First thing this morning I called the 888 number and the recording told me that HSBC had denied my loan, and I would have to wait for the IRS to deposit my refund in 8 to 15 days. The preparer led me to believe that I had already been approved. I was depending on that money to pay rent and shut-off notices that I had accumulated after the holiday. No one can tell me why I was not approved for the loan; every other year the same bank has approved my RALs. If the preparer would have told me that there was a chance that I would not receive my refund in the 1 to 2 days I would have saved my self $240 and done them myself. In my opinion the company and their employees are misleading their customers just to get as much money as they can from the customers. They seem to me to be just like common criminals. The RAL fees were refunded to me since I was denied, but I'm still out the $240 in preparation fees that I would have saved had I done them myself. Plus, I am in danger of having several utilities shut off because of the hold up.
I went to H&R Block in Pompton Lakes, NJ, to do my return. I thought it would be simple and fast, but I was wrong. I was there for over 2 hours dealing with a guy who was clueless. I was not explained anything. The only thing I was told is that I would have the check that night. As it turns out, no check. Then I was told to pick it up the next day. I took off work to go get my check and again no check. DENIED! What a mess. Now I am out $300, a day's pay and unnecessary aggravation. Supposedly I will get my check in 9-15 days. Doubt it. They should go out of business! NEVER USE H&R BLOCK!
We went in to file our taxes with H&R Block, yesterday 02/16/08. We have used them for 11 years. This year it was a different location as we moved, but same company. Every year we get the RAL. Last year we got it in two checks, one the first day and the rest within 3 days. This year we opted for the same day loan, and it was rejected. The preparer offered us the classic RAL which meant 1-2 days. We opted for that and paid an extra $297 in fees for preparation and RAL--$107 of that to the bank for the RAL. I checked the website first thing this morning to see the status, and it said that the bank (HSBC) denied the RAL, and we would get a RAC in 8-15 days. This means the IRS will deposit our refund with HSBC, and HSBC will send us a check through H&R Block. I called the IRS because I could not figure out why the RAL had been declined when we get it every single year. I thought maybe we owed IRS and didn't know it. IRS confirmed that we DID NOT OWE and that it seemed that HSBC just did not want to approve it. That makes no sense to me. So I called H&R Block back to find out about the $107 in fees that the bank charged and was told that the fees would be returned to us with the refund check. We have decided that we will no longer use H&R Block again as their advertising seems to be more and more false each and every year. I am also finding that HSBC has a lot to do with who they approve and who they don't. BUT...they still earn a check fee, and H&R Block still receives a commission for getting the RAL or RAC. We were planning on paying off some bills, paying our rent and utilities (which water and electric have a cut off notice for the 8th) getting the truck tagged, insured and new tires put on it and taking a 1st time ever trip (in 11 years) the weekend of Valentine's day. I just don't see it happening because we are supposed to wait 8-15 days for our refund.
I filed and was promised 1-3 days using ral. I paid close to $200, but 7 days later no money. I get the same answers and same phone#, but no response. I quit using H&R Block for about 5 years, then you hear and see all the tv ads and you think wow, maybe they have gotten better. I lost then and lost now. I, myself, will be outside my local h&r block store, telling people they are a joke, maybe others will follow!! Let's say I'm really late on a lot of bills and the wife and I promised our kids things and well you know the story.
I recently had a baby and wanted to ensure that I would get the most out of my refund. I went into the office, and the gentleman was not very detailed trying to assist me. (He couldn't even spell the word catering; I typed it for him on his computer.) Well, after we finally reached the end, he told me about the 1-2 day RAL. He told me that it was the best way to do it, and my check would be available on Monday. I filed on Saturday. I signed the papers he told me to sign and paid A LOT EXTRA to receive my check on Monday. Sunday came, and I contacted H&R Block to check the status of my refund, and was given another number and website that the previous gentleman never gave me. I was told that I was turned down for the loan and had to wait 8-15 days for the check. I wish I would have been told that I could have been turned down for the loan. I could have saved almost $300 on just having some guy fill in the blanks for me. I went into the office to file my complaint about his lack of communication and was told that I could expect the check on 2/22: twenty days after I filed--not even close to 8-15 days, which is unbelievable! I am very upset that I spent time, MONEY, and could have filed at home to receive the money sooner and right into my bank account. And to top it all off, trying to find a corporate number on the H&R Block website to file my complaint, is impossible! Let's finish this with: Don't file at H&R Block!
I went in to H&R Block to have my taxes filed. I am a single father with 2 kids, and I stay strapped. I qualified for eic credit and should receive close to $6000. I needed the money as soon as possible, so the tax preparer told me I could put the money on an Emerald Master card, and the money would be there in a few hours. She put in my information, and I was denied the instant Ral. She told me, however, I was approved for the 24-48 hr. Ral. Needing the money, I called and called after 72 hours--no money on the card. I finally got a representative at H&R block that told me the IRS intercepted my refund for some reason--possibly a mistake from a previous year, and it would be 8-15 days before I would see any money on the emerald card. Why did I have to go through all of these lies if there was a possibility of the money not being there in the 24-48 hour promised time? I don't like being lied to. H&R Block needs to quit promising people money that they can't deliver. I WILL NOT BE BACK THERE! Rent and electric wasn't paid on time, so late fees have been added.
On 1-30-08 I went to H&R to have taxes prepared. I chose the 1-2 day RAL. Was told check would probably be in 2-1-08. Called 2-1-08 - no check. Called 2-2 and was told maybe check would be in later that day. I then called the 1-888-832-5625 number mentioned on the bottom of the application and got a recording stating I was denied for the RAL because I did not meet their criteria. No reason was given, and of course there was no individual to talk to. The only reason I could think of is that I do not use credit and therefore have NO CREDIT HISTORY - certainly not bad credit. So, I called H&R back and told them what I found out and was told it wasn't their fault the bank turned me down--that I would get my money in 8-15 days. I said I PAID TO GET MY MONEY IN 1-2 DAYS. I was then told there was nothing she could. I asked where the money was coming from and she said the bank. I said you mean the same bank that turned me down for 1-2 days is now accepting me for 8-14 days - how is that possible? She said she didn't know and had no answers. I asked if she could not get me answers, and she said simply NO. I am a poor single woman with a child that was depending on that quick turn around of my money for bills, groceries, necessities of life. I spent money to have taxes prepared by H&R and EXTRA money to have the return expedited in 1-2 days FOR NOTHING, and no one wants to help me. What recourse do I have? Naturally, I will never go to H&R again, but what does that do for me while I wait 8-15 days? Tell that to your creditors. They don't care - all they want is their money; and right now that's all I care about - GETTING MY MONEY.
I've been going to HR Block for that past 5 yrs, just for the RAL. This experience was the worst by far. I had my taxes done on 1/31/08. This year was the first year I had not received the same day RAL. I should have known something was wrong then. I was told that I would get my check in 1-2 days still, but everyone else was getting them by early morning next day. I waited and waited. I decided to call and was told the IRS had rejected my return because my employer EIN was incorrect. Then I was asked if the employer gave me the wrong EIN. (I work for a trillion dollar company with a staff of 50,000; I think they have figured out what EIN they should be using by now.) Needless to say I was told I should have my check by the end of the day. When I brought it to their attention that I would have my check if the error had not been made and how disappointed I was, their response was that they still had 16 hours to get me the check. My check and my issues with the service that I had been provided were two separate issues. To make matters worse I called their 866# and was told by their representative that the IRS again rejected my return because of a wrong EIN. Once I provided then with the correct number, the IRS accepted my return within 7 hours. When I called to talk to a manager the next morning, I was told that first she was with a TaxPro (really funny the use of the word TaxPRO). Two hours went by with no call; I called again and was told she was with a client. One of the comments that stick out to me about this experience is that I was told that people make mistakes and the TaxPros are people and they make mistakes too. I am sorry, but when we are paying out hard earned money to these people there is no room for errors; the IRS doesn't work like that. I've paid for services that were not provided.
I went to Block to get my taxes done and opted for the instant ral on the card, but it came back being denied. A pop-up on the computer screen asked, "Want to try the classic ral?" So I then opted for that choice and waited the 1-2 days and found out that I was denied. So now I must wait up to 15 days for the refund. I don't know why I was denied. I did not claim all sorts of EIC's or anything, nor is my credit all that bad. I have always qualified in the past. I would like to offer a word of caution to anyone who is denied the instant ral: just go with the standard e-file and leave it at that because if you were turned down for the instant ral, you will also be turned down for the 1-2 day ral. I believe HRBlock is fully aware of this and should tell clients, but they don't. I have no idea if or when I'll receive any of the fee's charged to me in association with the ral.
I went to H&R block and had my taxes done yesterday morning. I had a really good experience at first, and the girl doing them seemed to be intelligent and knowledgeable about her field. After I found out I was getting a large refund, she started to go over my options for paying for the tax preparation and getting my money. She mentioned a 1-2 day RAL, told me that the money would be deposited on an Emerald Mastercard and that I could use the same as a credit or debit card except that it was prepaid with my refund on it. It was $89.95 extra for this option. Since we were getting a large refund and were strapped for cash as usual, we decided to pay the extra money to have the refund sooner rather than later. The girl assured me it would post probably by 8:00 that night, but by this morning at the latest. Well, we took the day off work, school, etc, and splurged by taking the whole family to Chuck E. Cheese for the day (which is 2 hours from my home). The guy at the tax office told me to check around noon to see if my money was in yet, but to call them this evening if it still wasn't there. So I called back tonight, and when I finally got a representative on the phone they informed me my RAL was denied and that I had to wait 8-14 business days for my refund! No one had explained to me there was any possibility of this being denied. If I had known it could be denied I would not have paid $90 extra for it! And to top things off I spent money I didn't have out of my bank account to do something nice with my children expecting the refund money to be there to cover the excess, only to find out it won't be. Now I will have to borrow money from family so my bank account does not go negative before my husband's next payday. We were counting on that money. When I found out (on my cell), I cried all the way home from Chuck E. Cheese. Our finances are so bad, I really was counting on that money, and I felt lied to and taken advantage of. No thanks, H&R Block. You should EXPLAIN the fine print to people before having them sign on the dotted line. It isn't any way to conduct business.
Instead of doing my taxes for free, last year I used HR Block and received an anticipation loan. This year I went back, and to my surprise I was denied. I'm a single dad on low income who needs this money. So now, I'm getting my refund check later than if I had done my taxes myself, on-line--because it now has to go through HR Block's greedy hands first before I can get what is left. It also cost me over $300 for the disappointment--and I'm still being charged for the bank fees. I think there should be an investigation. They've stepped up their advertising yet made it harder to qualify. They give you a number to call to make sure the loan goes through, and it still didn't. It is a scam. I filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau. By doing my own tax filing, I could have gotten more back than what they got for me. I'm so upset! I got to watch my girls cry when they found out.
Every year, I qualify for rapid refund or a 1-2 day loan. This year, to my surprise, I was rejected, even after being a faithful customer for more than 5 years. I agree. They are now using the RAL to reel in poor people--then let them walk away empty-handed. read more hide
instead of having my sister or father do my taxes online FOR FREE, i instead went to h & r block, thinking that i would spend the $500 (around) that i spent last year to get my money NOW (i take care of my neice & nephew & dont make a lot of money) on the commercials they make it sound easy & simple, & every year i qualify. this year i was told i did not meet the qualifications & could not do the money now check, but that I DID qualify for the one to two day check & she ashured me i would have the check by the following day. when they did not call i decided to call & was then informed that i actually did not qualify & that i would have to wait up to 15 days for my check! this is awful, & to top it off i paid around $400 for NOTHING at all! im so upset, this isnt right & they shouldnt be allowed to do this to people! I was counting on this money, i spent money that i did have thinking i would have my money the next day, & instead ended up having to borrow & stress out about money! that money was for my rent, food etc. it has really messed things up for me this month! read more hide
This year I decided to go to H & R Block to have my taxes done seeing as you are able to get your money back either the same day you file or within 1-2 days. My preparer checked to see if I could receive the RAL (for the same day) and it came back declined. He told me that it was worth a try and sometimes goes through for people and sometimes doesn't. He then told me that I did qualify for the 1-2 day loan. He NEVER told me that this depended on your credit history and such. I have very poor credit and never would have had him TRY to put it through if I had known that. Anyway, he offered me the Emerald card, but I said that I preferred a check. He gave me a card with a toll free number on it and said to call it after 10 am the following day to check the status on my refund. He said hopefully it would be there, if not it would most definitely be there the following day. Well, I called and called and called. I would get a message telling me that the my information had been submitted to the IRS and that H & R Block was waiting for a response. Then the next time it would tell me that unfortunately my RAL was denied and they would issue me a check within 8-15 days. I called that afternoon and asked to speak with the accountant who prepared my taxes. The receptionist took a message for him to call me back, but he never did. Finally that evening I called him again and he told me that it can be denied for numerous reasons such as back child support, certain judgements and/or bad credit. The first 2 I knew about, but the bad credit of course I had no idea about that because again, no one had warned me that it could be denied for that reason. So now the money that I had counted on to be here within 1-2 days is not going to be here for 1-2 weeks or so. I called my preparer back and he told me that they do adjust the fee that you paid for the 1-2 days down to the standard 8-15 days fee. I guess I will have to wait and see. Well, my husband received his paycheck on this same day and we paid on bills that we would have normally waited on because we THOUGHT we would have more money right away. So now today is the 25th and of course rent is due on February 1st and we won't have it. We would have banked this check to go for rent, but now we actually have pretty much nothing in our pockets until a week from today when his next paycheck comes and that will only cover about 1/3 of our rent. I just really wish that they would have at least told me that there was a possibility that I wouldn't be able to get my money in the 1-2 days. I just feel really bad for the other low income families who are going to go through the same thing this year. read more hide
I went to the local H&R Block office with hopes of recieving my taxes earlier. I sat with one of their Tax Specialists for over an hour doing my taxes, at the end of which I was told I might qualify for an instant refund, which I really needed the money to pay my bills. After being denied for the instant refund I was told that it automatically goes to a 1-2 day RAL with no problems, so they pushed their debit card on me and I left thinking that in 1-2 days I could pay my bills and everything would be ok. I checked their site just like I was told 1 day later, then 2, and was informed that I was rejected for the RAL. So basically I spent 265 dollars on H&R block fee's and 73.42 on bank fees for a card I really cannot use for 8-15 days still. In my opinion this was a big rip off, I was mis-informed by H&R block about getting a refund faster, and I will NEVER go to any H&R block office again. read more hide
I am extremely unsatisfied with my experience involving H&R Block. I normally use a small tax company to take care of my needs every year. Due to financial issues, I needed funds quickly. I was told by many people not to go to H&R Block due to the rates of charge for services. Well, this year I bit the bullet and went because I was under the impression by the representative for H&R Block, who prepared my return, said I would receive funds within twenty-four hours. That's fine, because that's what I was told that day (Jan 22 08 ). Today I call the office to inquire about a city tax voucher and other paper work that the rep. couldn't give me that same day I had my taxes done, which seemed slightly ironic but yet I agreed to COME BACK to get my paperwork due to the convenience and time it took to do my taxes, and not to mention I was TOLD I would be receiving my funds on my emerald card within 24 hours. I had an associate of mine come along, and he heard this as well. I called the office today and now I'm told I was denied by some outside bank, and that I would not receive funds on my card for another fifteen days. This isn't going to work with me. If I were TOLD in person that I would not receive the funds for fifteen days, then I would have gone to my regular tax preparer and I would have not only paid 50 % less than what H&R Block is charging me, I would have had an honest experience as well. This is why I do not go to H&R Block. I do plan to pursue this to the farthest extent until I am satisfied. If the rep. would have just told me the truth, I would not be writing this, I would have just accepted the facts and lived with it. I feel as if I have been violated, and lied to. The result to this experience delayed bills that were late in which I was told I would receive funds in 24-48 hrs. read more hide
On January 9th, 2008, I went to H&R Block to have my taxes e-filed to the IRS. I was given a master card called the Emerald Advance Card, and was assured I would have my refund directly deposited onto my card within 24-48 hours. Three days later, which was Monday, I called Donna Nelson, The preparer who filed my taxes, and she told me I was denied for the RAL but that I would have my refund within 8-15 days. It has now been over three weeks since I filed and I still have not received my refund. I asked if I was able to get the bank fees back since I could have tele-filed my return and got it back sooner, and they simply said no. My federal refund was to be approximately $7,000.00, and my state refund was to be $186.00. On the 22nd of January, a deposit of $75.00 was posted to my card and when I called H&R Block to see what this amount was they did not have an answer and gave me the number to call the IRS. I called the IRS right then, and the gentlemen I spoke to said they had my information right there and that the amounts I had given him were correct and that my check from the IRS was set to be deposited into H&R Block's bank account. I still have not heard anything from H&R as to the status of my refund, and they have no information as to when I will get my money. I needed the money to pay my rent and to take care of my 1 year old who was suffering from pneumonia. Since they assured me that day that I would have my refund within two days, I spent my rent money on doctors visits, medication, soup, pedialite and diapers, things that my children needed. So when I found out I wasn't getting my refund for another two weeks, I was on he verge of being evicted, and with no job and a sick child. And to make matters worse i am now stuck paying for an expedited service that I never received. And still no word on where my tax return is. read more hide
I went in on 1-4-08 to get my taxes done and was told that I would get a same day loan advance of $500. We went through the whole process, then the computer locked up and I was told that I would need to come back the following day. The next day I went back to see the same lady but she wasn't in. I was given to someone new who made all kinds of changes to my file. I found out that they couldn't even send my taxes till the 11th of Jan, so I went back on the 11th to finish the process. I was told that I qualified for the 1-2 day loan. I was given an emerald card and was told to check the following day. I did - nothing. Five days later I finally contacted the IRS. They told me they received and began to process my information, however it was up to H&R Block to give me my money. HRB told me it was up to the IRS. HRB mislead me, lied to me from the beginning and I was charged about $400 for all of this. read more hide
I went to H&R Block on January 15, 2008. I had seen all the commercials on T.V. for the RAL. I am a single mother and live paycheck to paycheck, so the quicker I could get my money the better. Considering I am getting back a good amount, I said what the heck, I will pay the extra amount (which came to almost $400). Not once did the tax preparer tell me that it was a loan. If I had known that, then I would have NEVER done it because I have not-so-good credit. So, as I waited 1..2..3..days, I finally called the office and was told by the receptionist that everyone was busy and that she would have someone call me as soon as possible. It has been 6 days and no one has returned my call. Nice customer service. So I had to go online and check the statis of my refund. I WILL NEVER USE H&R BLOCK AGAIN!! So as a result, I'm out $400 and still waiting for my refund which could take up to 15 days. What a scam! read more hide
I don't know if H&R Block gets a commission for how ever many of their debit cards they are able to push onto people, but I too was told I would receive my money in 24-48 hours. Well, after not getting it, I called them and they said the bank denied my loan. Which doesn't make sense because I was reading about the card and it is impossible to go over the limit that is set on it. I was told the IRS received my tax forms and approved them. I called the IRS and they have no information on me at all for this year. If I was approved, as H&R Block says I was, then the money should be placed on the card and that should be it. What does it matter what my credit situation is if I can't spend more then what is on the card? read more hide
I went into H and R Block to file my taxes and opted for the ral loan. I was denied for the money now loan but was told I could get the traditional ral and was sent away with their mastercard and told my refund would be on there within 24 to 48hrs. I called the bank and was told I was denied because I did not meet screening criteria but H and R Block assured me I was approved and had no problem collecting the 231 dollars to file for the ral, which I will not get and I am still waiting 8 to 15 day for refund. I am now unable to pay bills and get my 3 month old daughter her medication which could save her hearing. read more hide
I went into H&R Block to get my taxes prepared was offered the RAL and then they denied me for same day money. So they had told me that it came back and said I was approved in 1-2 days to get my money. I paid right at 400 dollars for this service because I really needed this money as the past year had been a very difficult year and I am supporting my sister right now because she had medical probloms with her daughter. Now they are telling me when I called that prepaid card they gave me to have my taxes put on, that my money will not come until 8-15 days and our rent is depending on this money. That is why I paid so much to get it back, so I am pretty sure I will have an eviction notice on my door before I see that money. And just to think I trusted these people, I would never had paid 400 dollars to get my money in 8-15 days, that is for sure. That is the standard time for the IRS. I just feel like I was targeted for a scam because when I told them the situation I was in, they took it to the bank with me. So now we have a sick little girl and are going homeless because of H&R Block. I will never use them again and advise everyone else if you are a lower income family, do not use H&R Block please. They took advantage as they knew I needed the money really bad to keep a roof over my family's head and to pay some medical expences. I am going to be evicted from my home now and my sister lives with me because she lost everything due to having a sick child, so the 400 dollars that I paid those snakes could of paid for her breathing machine that she needs. I don't know what I am going to do as of right now. read more hide
I went in and was told I was approved for a ral loan and would get my money in 24-48 hours. Well, I go to look and it was denied; so I called and was told the denial was due to a credit criteria. I was approved from them last year, so now I must wait 8-14 days for my loan and probably still be stuck with bank fees. I will never use HR Block again in my life. read more hide
I went to H&R block on 3/16/07, and they told me I could get the RAL and that I was approved.They told me to inquire the next day, and that I would have my money. They gave me the emerarld card and my paperwork, and I was off and happy ! I even asked the gentleman at the office, what if I don't get approved for the RAL? He said, "If you don't that's your problem, not mine" and he laughed. Well, to my surprise they did not accept my loan; it was denied, and that I would receive my bank fee money back in 8-15 days. But H&R Block said it was up to the bank to decide whether I get approved, and even though I didn't get the RAL, I would still have to pay the bank fee. And before I left H&R Block office on 3/16, they knew I was not approved, but told me I was anyway--just so they could get their filing fee. I call this a scam. I wish that I and everybody else could get our money back for these fees. read more hide
I decided to use H&R block again this year to file my taxes at the beginning of this year. I brought my info in to the local office and opted for the Refund Anticpation Loan. As we are going through the process of filling, I was asked if I owed and taxes. I told the rep not to my knowledge. I filed last year and had no problem. she told me that they were checking with the IRS electronically to see if I owed any money. The result came back letting us know that no money was owed and I could get the RAL. I received my check and went home. About 5 days later I get a call from H&R Block telling me that I do owe for taxes and that I need to pay back my loan. I asked the guy about the check they did to see if I owed anything and he said something to the effect of it's not our fault and promptly hung up. So not only do I have to pay pack the $455.00 for them. Find out that I owe about $1200.00 in taxes. read more hide
I went to H&R Block to file my taxes was briefly offered different options. I was told that instant refund was denied from HSBC, but that I could still apply for the ral and that it was approved and to check back. After the two days I was given a number to call and the automated call service informed me it would be 8 to 15 days before my tax refund will be due. yeah right. H&R Block knew my application for instant refund had been denied within seconds and assured me that ral method would be no longer than two days but after two days their expertise and assurances are all gone. read more hide
Rachelle of Goshen IN (03/03/07) My husband and I filed our taxes on the H&R Block website and we also got the ral loan, and was supposed to get it back within 2-3 days and now it's going on 5 days and we still don't have it. It was supposed to be deposited into our bank account, and it's not yet. I've called H&R Block and they can't tell me anything because they don't know anything. I also called the main IRS number and all they tell me is it's being processed and it could take up to 3 weeks to get it. I am very upset and I think it's false advertisement. read more hide
I went to HR Block on 2/1/07 to get my taxes prepared. I was approved for a RAL loan. I decided to get the Emerald card so I could get my money the same day or at least some of it. I paid $385 for the service and was not satisfied at all. It took me three weeks to get my money on the card and they did not refund any of the fees. read more hide
On January 30, 2007 I went in the h&r block to have my taxes prepared. Upfront I asked how long would it take for me to get my refund, because I had in apointment at the IRS and could have gotten an electronic refund in two weeks for free because I am low income. I was told that there were different options that would be told to me after I my tax information was put in the system but I could get it in 1-2 days. After all my information was put in the system I was told I was approved for a ral loan and that I could either recieve $500 today minus $300 and change for fees and get the remaining in 1-2 days or wait 1-2 days and receive the full amount. I was given an emerald debit card and told the funds would be available in 1-2 days. The next day I get a call from H&R block saying the bank denied my loan and it would be available in 8-14 days. I asked if the same fees were gonna be charged, since I was being charges over $300 in all. The lady was very sharp with me and not helpful. I feel like I have been totally scammed especially now after reading all the other testimonies of other H&R block customers. This is a total bait and switch situation. I am a single mother of two. Recently unemployed and on welfare. All my bills are behind. I was counting on the immediate money before my car is repossessed and other bills are put in collection. I cannot afford to give away $300 for nothing. read more hide
I went to file my taxes on 1/27/07. Because I'm a single mom with four kids and a single job, I'm always in dire straits financially, and opted for the most money I could get the quickest I could get it. I did not qualify for the Instant Cash option, but did qualify (I thought) for the RAL product. They gave me instant cash that started out being $500, but after all their fees and the bank's, the amount that was actually deposited onto the prepaid debit card was $226.26. They told me the rest would be deposited on the card in 1 to 2 days. Two days have gone by...no cash. When I called them, they were downright snotty, telling me that the bank denied the RAL for internal bank reasons that they didn't know about. Now I have to wait for 8-10 days. Not only did I spend way too much money on the opportunity to get cash quickly, but now I'm not even sure what's wrong or if I can count on getting this money next week. At this point, the bank that handled the RAL decision shouldn't even be involved anymore. They've taken their fees so that money should go from the IRS straight to me; not to them. So what happened? Is it just the whole H&R scam? Is it the credit thing? Or, is it something else? I'm now sitting on pins and needles waiting to see if something else is wrong. I find it difficult to believe that everyone else who applies for quick money from H&R isn't in the same situation I'm in...perpetually broke and living from payday to payday. Credit shouldn't have anything to do with this RAL. If the IRS accepts the application, that should be good enough for the bank. They're already making money hand-over-fist off people who can't afford to spend that kind of money. read more hide
Me and my family came here to file out taxes, like we have done for the last 15 years. This time the person servicing us stated that WE have a new bank product this year. Your ral in 1-2 days guaranteed! we have used there services for years and allways have gotten rapid refund in as little as 3-6 days. We trusted their product and tried it this year. on 1-26-07 the HR branch stated that we didn't qualify for RAL. This is a first in 15 years!!!! We were denied for internal bank reasons! They would give any contact numbers for the bank. And they also couldn't or wouldn't look into a refund of $346.76 in tax and bank fees. This has cost our family a lot of financial grief this time. This has never happened before and it wont happen again. These services that this company is offering is geared toward people with low income who cannot afford to pay the $100 upfront to get there taxes done and a refund in 10 days. read more hide
I inquired about an Instant Refund Loan as I was desperate for money. I indicated I needed to take money home with me as soon as I filed. I had them do my taxes and they offered me a debit card with a credit of up to 2500.00 until my refund loan could be processed, depending on what their bank decided. I received $500, of which the tax prep, filing fees, and interest would be deducted from. They said the remainder of my refund (over 6,000) would be added within 1-2 days. It was my understanding that I would only get $500 that day, and would have to wait for up to 48 hours for the balance of the refund. The very next day there was a message on my answering machine to call Tim at H & R Block (their records have my home, cell, and work). The only way I received the message is because my boyfried called me with the message. I was told that the bank had denied my loan, I told him I didn't even know it was a loan, (I thought that's why I didn't get the $2,500) and I would get a refund sent to their office in 8 - 10 days. I let him know that I had a debit card - he said it would show up in 8 - 10 days. I said, well, I paid $222 for you all to lend me $280, and I could have filed and monitored my own taxes. His response was he was only the messenger. I feel that a plain English (or whatever the native language happens to be) explanation of what to expect from H & R Block, if I had know that I was only going to get $280 for the time frame, I would have went to my local loan shark - it would have been a lot cheaper. I'm angry for two reasons, one they should have made it clearer that this was a two step process, and since I made myself clear about needing the money when I left, they should have checked it out and let me know that day that I would not be getting the money as soon as I expected - NOT leaving me a message on my answering machine, since they had all the numbers needed to contact me personally. And second, for letting myself get in to this situation. read more hide
I was misinformed by the Senior Tax Advisor about the Rapid refund options available. They stated that one was based solely on acceptance of my IRS Tax Return, and the other was credit driven. I already know my credit is bad, so obviously I chose the option that left my credit out of the equation. I was told I would receive my check on the 5th or the 8th of January only to find out on the 5th that the IRS wasn't accepting returns until the 12th. I was told my return would come back on the 15th or 16th. No problem I said. I trust it will be there this time. Now I get a call on the 15th telling me that my RAL was declined due to a tax lien or student loan. It was actually my credit (as stated by HSBC Bank...the lending bank) and not a tax lien (as stated by the Tax Advisor). Now that the deed is done, I can't go anywhere else because the IRS already has my return, so I'm stuck with H&R Block. I made payment arrangements with gas, phone, car note, and electricity bills. I'm a single father of three, money doesn't come easily around here. If I would have known the truth in the beginning, I would gone about things differently, and definately would not have used their services. I know my credit is bad, so why would approach a bank when I know they base loans on credit or financial statements. My options now are to take it like a man. Checks are going to bounce, lights will probably get cut off. Once that happens, I'm effectively out of business because I'm an independent insurance broker working from home. I'm resourceful, so I'm sure I'll find a way to take care of things. I'm just shocked at how little H&R Block has done to admit & correct their campaign of misinformation. No sorry for the lies and inconvenience. I pay for the convenience. I could filed for free and gotten my money from the IRS faster than they're giong to do it; and no thank you for the money they ripped off. read more hide

I went and did my taxes at H & R block in 2000 and I was told that I could get my loan back in five days with a ral loan. So I signed the papers for the loan. and then the IRS didnt pay the loan, so I have to pay 4,560. the next year. The IRS took my refund and paid the loan to Household Bank. It was on my credit as bad credit, and I still was out of my refund. What can i do to get my money back from my 2000 tax return?I was waiting for my money and I got behind in my bills. My Car was repoed, and I just got behind in my bills. read more hide
We applied for an RAL loan and was told to come in the next day; the next day we were told that we had been deined for the loan (we had been told when we filed the parers that it was already approved). Now after checking with the IRS I found that our refund has been deposited into their (H&R Block) account. I called H&R Block and asked about getting our money, the woman told me that it wouldn't be available until 3/9 and we would have to pay $25 for the check. I stated that I could have had my money already if it had been deposited into my account and she told me no it would take an additional 2 weeks...I checked with the IRS to see if this is true and they just said no, a direct deposit is just that. Don't know what to do about it....just extremely annoyed. read more hide
I decided to file my Federal taxes with H & R Block this year (2006) in order to get a rapid refund. I went to their local branch on February 3rd, 2006. I dropped off the paperwork, and told them I wanted to file "Rapid Refund". I was told that it would be a week or more before they could get to them, but they said "leave the paperwork, and as soon as we can, we'll do it and give you a call. On February 9th they called me, and I came into the office to sign everything. I was to get $465 back. The fee was to be $75 for the paperwork preparation and $29 if I wanted direct deposit of the refund, the amount of the refund would be about $360. I told them that I did not want to have the funds direct deposited, just have the check sent to the office and I would pick it up. By March the 3rd I had not heard anything from them. I went on-line to IRS.gov and looked up the status of my refund. It said that the funds had been direct deposited on February 24th, and that the amount deposited was only $70. I did some quick math, and realized that the IRS had withheld an amount that I had previously owed, and that the net remainder was $70. I immediately called the Block office and spoke with the manager. I explained to him that it had been over a month since I filled for a "Rapid Refund", and had not heard anything from them, and that the IRS says my refund had already been "deposited". I told him that I had never provided a routing number for any deposit, so how did they direct deposit it, and where was my money? He said that by "deposited", that meant it had been deposited in THEIR account, and that I was responsible for the fee ($29), and that rather than receiving a refund of $70, I actually owed THEM $45! I told him that first of all, I was verbally told by two of the preparers that had worked on my taxes, that since it had taken soooo long for them to do my paperwork (was just a standard return), that there would ONLY be a $25 charge for everything. I told this to the manager, and he basically called me a liar, since he "knows" his employees would never have told me that. My wife and I had BOTH heard the same thing from both preparers! I asked him how he could possibly be charging me $75 for a "Rapid Refund" also, when it took over a month to get a resolution from the IRS, and then had never bothered to call me? This is HARDLY RAPID!!! He got very nasty with me, and said "Sir, we WILL bill you for this $45, and you WILL pay it. You are wrong and WE are right". So much for their "Complete Customer Satisfaction Guarantee"! read more hide
My husband and I went in to do our taxes on the 3rd of February. We had had a problem last year, but thought it was a one time thing. Anyhow, we opted for the 1 day, they said they saw no problem , to call back the next day. Needless to say, the next day they gave us 1/2 check and almost 11 days later, the rest, less the 2 day fee. I think this is ridiculous. If I had even gotten it in 4 days I wouldn't have complained, but to pay $229 for 12 day service is absurd. read more hide
I had my taxes prepaired at H&R Block. I needed my money quickly to pay a few bills so I opted to get my money in 1-3 days. I didn't get my money until 5 days - that's not what I paid for. The H&R Block associates are very rude and put you on hold and then hang up on you when you call. I called the district office and the woman said she would have a representative get ahold of me in a couple of days. It has now been two weeks and no respoonse. I will never go to H&R Block ever again. read more hide
I went to H&R Block to get my taxes filed. I did get the 1-2 day RAL which i have been getting for the last 4 years. i have never had a problem. However this year I have been calling the office to chck to see if my check has come because this is the 3rd day and they said it hasen't. so i called their bank thats on the form they gave me. The bank in turn told me that my information was missing something and they rejected my request. I called the east boston h&R block office and was told by the receptionist that she gave my file to the mgr and he is lookiing at it. I now have to wait another couple days and i think that i deserve some kind of credit for them not taking care of my information when the hbsc bank returned that file they should get right on the phone and called me to let me know what had happened. read more hide
I've used the online tax services with H&R Block. I prepared the taxes and went ahead and e-filed. I was never prompted for an option for receiving my expected refund. The only option given was to print out and mail in the forms or to e-file. I went ahead and e-filed. Only after it was filed do I find out that due to my financial situation, I was automatically being offered a Refund Anticipation Loan (RAL) through H&R Block's own HSBC Bank. I was not given the option to refuse this loan. Now my taxes have been e filed and the bank routing and account numbers that appear on my 1040 (automatically filled in and filed by H&R) is not my own account number. At this point I have no idea whose, what, how, this account number appears as the recipient of my refund. H&R BLock's online chat help with "Christina V." was no help. Her response was: don't worry about the loan, if you don't qualify you will simply be charged the bank fee and the remainder of your refund will be forwarded to your account. (Mind you at this point I have not submitted an account to which they will forward the "remaining" refund amount). read more hide
I always file my taxes myself electronically and have my refund within 10 days using Turbotax, which costs only a few dollars. This year I decided to get the rapid refund, so filed with H&R Block. Big mistake! The guy who was helping me prepare my taxes continually made errors while entering my information into the computer, so had to keep correcting him so my return would be filed correctly. This company charges outrageous fees to just file a basic return, and even more so when you want your refund fast. Well, as it turns out, when I called to find out the status of my return, I had been denied for the rapid refund after I had been assured by the representative that I had been approved, because I specifically asked him what would happen if I weren't since I was paying so much extra money for this service. His exact words were "Oh no, you're already approved. There won't be a problem. Hmmmmm. So much for their guarantee of accuracy. Well, needless to say, I wasn't and when I asked the reason, I was told by a manager "That they weren't privy to bank information and couldn't tell me anything". Interesting since they had no problem collecting the money for the service of which I was denied, but could give me any further information, nor the information of the bank which denied me. To make a long story very short, I am basically out $139.00 for virtually nothing. I gained absolutely no benefit from filing with them because the end result is the same, except alot more costly. read more hide
My husband and I went in on January 7th to have our taxes done. Needing the money asap, we paid to have a refund anticipation loan so we would have our money in 2 days. On the 9th we called H&R Block to see if our check was in to find out that we paid for a 2 day service, however the 2 days didn't apply until the IRS started accepting efiling. That was not told to us at the time we did our taxes, in fact we verified with our tax preparer more than once that it was going to be in on the 9th because we desperately needed that extra money. Everytime we asked we were assured it would be in on the 9th. Well here it is the 10th no check and of coarse "nothing H&R Block can do" read more hide
