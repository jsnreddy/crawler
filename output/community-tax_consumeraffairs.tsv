JK Harris screwed me out of 12 thousand dollars and I figured Community Tax wouldn’t do it, so I contacted them. I don’t pay the 12 thousand dollars on IRS. I talked to George, doing my taxes for me this year, and I don’t know why they keep taking money out when he told me it’s only three hundred bucks. I keep sending them stuff and they’re telling me they’re not getting my fax, they’re not getting my emails or their fax number has changed. And two weeks later they had told me "we haven’t receive your faxes." I was like, “Here’s the confirmation sheet saying you got them." They said “That number has been changed.” I replied, "Why didn’t you notify me? So now you put off my tax for another two weeks." I don't know what the runaround is now. I was gonna call George today or tomorrow and jump on his butt. But it’s all been pretty good. I’d come back again if I had any problem with them.
Community Tax has been excellent. They’re the best people and I can trust them. I had different people in California but these other people treated me like hell. On the other hand, Community Tax have the time and know what they’re doing. I wanted to save some money as I'm a truck driver, and the guy who was doing my tax did the taxes but never returned it to the IRS. I don’t know what he did with the paperwork and he put me in big trouble. I owe the IRS $20,000 but the IRS didn’t want to do a deal with me. They want the whole money in one shot, but I'm poor and don’t have the money. They don’t want to take payments either. That’s why I have to hire another guy here in California, but they were doing nothing. Until now, I’m happy with Community Tax. Everything is good and we’ve finished everything. They keep track of my IRS account. We have a little problem on that right now, no more with my money, but the IRS want to charge a different thing, and yet Community Tax are still working in my case. They’re doing a wonderful job with a lot of people that know them.
I had a tax debt that I couldn't get rid of. I tried resolving it on my own a little bit, but I wasn't having very much success. So when I heard an advertisement on the radio about Community Tax, I thought maybe that was the way to go. I have successfully completed their program and I had it resolved a week and a half ago. I was really pleased with one of their staff named Daniel. He had an 'I really care about getting the situation resolved' attitude which I appreciate. Some of the other people that I dealt with at Community Tax weren't as helpful as he was, and that got me upset a little bit. But as soon as he took over my case, things just started happening. Any questions that I had, he answered them within a day or two.
I love Community Tax. I'm done resolving my federal issues, and coming up on the bottom end of the one for the state. I haven't met a person that was rude or negative. Whatever question I had, they wanted me to ask it, no matter how it sounded to me. If it was something that they had to look into for me because they might not be quite sure about based on my case, they got back to me on a timely manner, and I appreciated that. There was no stupid question. The only stupid question was the question I wasn't willing to ask. They definitely wanted to make sure I understood everything. I know more about taxes now, dealing with Community Tax, going through the IRS and all the tax information. They're excellent and I've recommended Community Tax to several people that had tax problems.
Very helpful to me. George ** and his staff very helpful over the years. Thank you.
Everything they offer you can do yourself with one phone call. I proved it and got my money refunded. Except for the initial 500 dollar investigation scam. Don't bother with any of these tax scammers. Just make the call yourself and save your money.
Community Tax is awesome. They were understanding and helped me get out of my debt as I was behind in my taxes and owed a lot of money. I would recommend Community Tax to anybody and will shoutout on my rooftop for them if they want me to. They've been the most helpful, most respectful and most pleasant thing I've ever done to help me fix my life and it's really appreciated.
Community Tax helped me out a lot. They were great. My ex-wife and I split up and I found out that she didn't file taxes on us for the last six years we were married. I didn't find out about this until we split up and I got a notice from the IRS. So obviously, I was anxious to get the matter resolved so I contacted them. I've completed their program and finally resolved my tax issues. They were all pleasant, very professional and they far exceeded my expectations.
Community Tax has everything. They keep me aware of what's going on and when I need to do something. They also inform me to make sure it gets done. It took a while but they told me that also and it's a great experience. They got the settlement on my plan and we made everything final yesterday. I then gave their number to another contractor who's a friend of mine.
The Community Tax people were very professional. The woman who helps with the payments gets you comfortable consistently, then there's your case worker and then the proctor. All of them have different points of contact with you where once you're done with one thing, you move to the other. They make it feel like they're really working hard for you.
I had a great experience with Community Tax. I owed the federal government but I didn’t know how to begin with the process of getting that taken care of, so I gave them a call. I got my Offer in Compromise right before Christmas, so I got a good settlement with the IRS. I just have to send that out to them to complete my process. Everything went great. Daniel was always courteous and would also call me every week to keep me in the loop. I was treated well. Community Tax did everything they said they were going to do. They were excellent and I would recommend them.
I owed the IRS some back taxes from 07 to 08, so I connected with Community Tax. I just found out a while ago that they got the offer in compromise and that the IRS accepted the offer, so everything worked out well. I had an expectation of the offer being reduced, but not as low as it ended up being. So I was surprised at how much they were able to reduce what I owed. Everyone I spoke to was very good and they were helpful in answering any questions I had. Everything was simple and painless.
I was behind on taxes so I decided to connect with Community Tax. They got me on an affordable payment plan and I was able to resolve my tax issues. They contacted me more than I contacted them. They’re not the type of people that just get their money and run. They’re very honorable about resolving tax issues. Anytime I asked them for anything, they got right onto it. They make things happen that my TPA couldn’t do and they negotiated well for me and able to keep me from having liens on my house. They are very dedicated.
I've finished my program with Community Tax and I'd recommend the company. The representative I had did a good job.
I was in trouble, so I decided to connect with Community Tax. After successfully completing their program, I haven't been bothered by the IRS. I believe it's over, Thank God and I've been telling other people about Community Tax and how good they are.
My dad was having problems and needed assistance with his IRS issues so we decided to call and get help from Community Tax. Right now, we have the five-month wait to pay off the offer, Income Promise. The representative, Daniel **, was very helpful in all of the questions that I had and anytime I needed to know anything, he was calling me before I even needed to call him. We're happy that they helped us with our situation and if we ever need any other assistance, we will definitely use them.
Community Tax is the best thing since sliced bread. I would recommend them.
The IRS was coming after me and Community Tax resolved all my issues with them. I would recommend them.
Knowledgeable and quick service, immediate response. I have no complaints. They are still working on a couple of tax issues I have, but the major part has been completed.
Community Tax was superb. Everything was resolved beyond my satisfaction and the communication was fantastic. The gentleman who ultimately handled everything for me, Daniel, was fantastic and I was treated very well. I recommend their service to anybody.
I did a search through BBB and looked at the ratings. Community Tax had positive reviews and the fees were very reasonable so I chose them. They did a great job. They were very accessible and personable, and did exactly what they said they were going to do. I completed their program.
I needed somebody to file old returns and clear up an identity fraud situation for me, so I did an internet search and have reviewed several places that offer the services. Community Tax have better reviews than most so I got them. I've successfully completed their program and I particularly enjoyed working with both Angela and Chris. They are very professional and always took my interest at heart.
I contacted Community Tax on behalf of my sister who had a significant IRS issue. I handled her finances at the time and was getting everything squared away. The experience was phenomenal. My sister owed a significant number, and we got a fantastic settlement. We've completed paying the IRS, but she still has issues with the states of New Jersey and New York. We know that Community Tax can handle New York but not New Jersey, so we're gearing up to get the New York issue going. So far, I would recommend Community Tax.
It was the internet that led me to Community Tax. I picked up the phone and thought, "Well, I'm gonna call them and see what they have to say." The gentleman who I talked to was fantastic and very informative, really friendly and made me feel comfortable. And because I was able to send them stuff over email and fax, I wasn't super concerned about the fact that they were in Chicago and I live in Arizona. They were very patient, kind and helpful. I've had them do my taxes a few times during the whole process just to help me file and keep everything in check, and they were fantastic. It took a long time to resolve my case but not because of their fault, it was the IRS. I was waiting a long time and thank God I got the positive results that I wanted and was really pleased. It made me happy. I would definitely recommend them to a friend.
I'll use Community Tax for the rest of my life. One of the big problems was Morgan. I lived in Morgan in 2004 - that's when I went through my divorce and went bankrupt after that. I got behind on my tax and was several years behind, and they did an excellent job with the resolution plan with the Federal Government and hardly anybody will ever deal with Morgan. I'm impressed with them.
I had tax issues that I needed to be resolved so when I heard about Community Tax from a friend, I connected with them. Everything's gone well so far, but they haven't finished my case yet.
I was looking for some help with some back taxes so I contacted Community Tax. For the first six months, the customer service was terrible. It was hard to get in touch with them, we couldn't get a response, and there was late filing of taxes - it was a little bit of everything. That was very frustrating. I think it was because of the person who was handling the case. Once I switched to someone else, it became good - very responsive. I have completed the program with Community Tax and I would recommend them to a friend.
I've had a fantastic time with Community Tax over the last few years. They've been trying to get me squared away immediately and we're about halfway through it - federal taxes are all taken care of now, only the state taxes remain. So I'm waiting to hear from them in another month or so. At this point, I can't say anything but complimentary things about the people that I've been dealing with. Right from my first call and talk with John, he stayed in touch with me throughout. He laid the groundwork then transferred me to a couple of ladies, Gina and Jennifer, who have been fantastic with me as well. I did have some problems early on, but they were corrected once I got established with these two ladies I knew I could talk to. I appreciate everything that they'd done for me because it took a lot of pressure off me. I'm now at ease.
Immediately after I posted my review I was contacted by Community Tax. The person who contacted me was extremely helpful and patient. He completed everything I needed done within 1 day and I am pleased with the outcome. I would say he went above and beyond my expectations in regard to resolving this matter.
I received a notice from the IRS with a deadline of August 17. I tried to work out my own resolution with the IRS from April 15th until June. With the deadline looming and no progress I called Community Tax. I spoke to Stephanie. She told me it would $6000 to resolve this problem. The reason for the hefty price tag was that a team of accountants and lawyers would expedite my file, take the necessary steps before the deadline. I was hesitant but desperate. She then called me and said that it was going to be an additional $1000 for now a total of $7000. As of today, I have submitted and re-submitted documents within 24 hours of request. I found out about the need for these documents by calling everyday myself to find out what was happening. My case manager sounded like a telemarketer and talked over me in a rude and condescending tone. She continued to say that she did not receive emails that I sent her, when I pulled up the time stamped emails and asked why they showed sent with no error, she continued to say she did not receive them. I called the Customer Service Manager who sent me a letter stating that it was her job to guarantee my satisfaction. When I explained to her the only reason I agreed to hire them was the urgency of my problem and the promise that it would be handled in an expedited fashion before my deadline, she responded that they are "very backed up with files". The complete opposite of what the salesperson described. That was back on August 17 my deadline. It is now September 2, I emailed her and my case manager on Monday of this week. Today is Wednesday and I received a vacation reply from my case manager and no response at all from the customer service manager that sent me the letter stating it was her sole job to guarantee my satisfaction. I have come to this website specifically to make consumers aware, because it was the 5 star review on this site that led me to call them. I am warning all consumers that the only thing that is 5 star about this company is the sales pitch. Please do not hire them, the money you send them can be applied to your tax debt.
I owed the IRS a whole lot of money so I decided to connect with Community Tax. I have now successfully completed my program with them to resolve that tax debt. They're very good. I even referred a friend that they’re working with now and they still do my taxes.
I have already successfully completed my Community Tax program to resolve my tax debt. They did my taxes last year, too. Everybody there was great and fantastic, and they would check on me in updating the forms. I am recommending them.
Community Tax is great and they did right by me. They did a nice job. Daniel ** was the last person I dealt with and he was absolutely the most professional of all the people I dealt with. He was incredible and he made the experience the best. He is the reason why I would go back to Community Tax. He was topnotch.
I had a tax problem and needed help so I contacted Community Tax. Everybody there is good. I'm now on a payment plan with them and my experience so far has been wonderful.
Community Tax was really helpful and pleasant, but they didn’t want to do some older ones and just let the government use their misinformation and try to negotiate. However, I wanted to redo including the oldest ones and come up with the correct numbers to negotiate with. We ended up doing that, but I didn’t have them do it because they wanted way too much money for it. So I did it on my own since I already have all the information. I have a payment plan with the government for the last bit of money that I owe, and Danny was especially helpful with making the final payments. Overall, I'd say that it was a good experience, but not one I want to go through again. I ended up correcting a problem that was my own fault, which cost me about 13% of what the government wanted getting them done. But I still saved over $100,000 from the first number with Community Tax's help, so I am happy with their service.
I contacted Community Tax when the IRS came knocking on my door and demanded $80,000. I completed the Community Tax program and they helped me save money. Out of the $80,000 debt, I only paid $15,000 between quarter cost or Community Tax's fees, and what they kept on my tax return and then what they finally settled out for. I'd definitely recommend them.
I needed help with taxes and dealing with the IRS and I don't think I could've done it without help. But I think because I live in Indiana and they were in Illinois and there was no people-to-people contact, I procrastinated a lot because I wasn't sure of what I needed - I've never had to do taxes before. I think that it would be better for me to be able to go to somebody's office, sit down with them and say, "Now, is this correct? Is this what you're asking for? Or is this what I need to do? Are there other things I can get to add to this?" Also, when I went to them and it ended up I owed about $8000, I thought they were going to negotiate or help me negotiate. They didn't talk to the IRS or do anything so I was getting into some problems there. They started to say, "We're going to put liens. We're going to take property. We're going to do your checking account." I got really scared of what was going to happen. I do have a lien against my house from the state IRS but I don't know if I just misunderstood what was supposed to happen. Then I called and got a really nasty person on the phone. I've never had that before. He said, "We can't do anything for you. You've made too much money a month." I got really upset and started crying. His boss heard him though and she did get on to him. I was shocked at that because I thought they will help me. Having said all that, my taxes are now done. They were there for me when I asked. They did good at what they did. Overall, I would give them a high rating only because I never had to worry about a phone call back or getting someone. I would recommend them to someone in Illinois but not to someone in Indiana unless they work in Illinois. It's not them, it's me.
Community Tax helped one of my friends out so I called them up and worked right with them. They already resolved my tax and did a wonderful job. What I really like about was once you talk to them, they didn’t try to cut you off the phone. They took their time and actually talk with you. For me, they dropped everything as though I was the one that was the most important thing at the time like when I called and I like that.
Community Tax worked with me to help resolve issues I have with my taxes. I'm very satisfied with the result and would recommend the people that I worked with. The first person who’s taken care of me is a guy named Oscar and was very nice. Maria ** my agent who's taking care of all my case works very nicely and will always call me when she told that she needs to call me. Another person named Jennifer ** was very good too.
We called Community Tax since me and my wife had some questions about our taxes that were already settled out. I didn't get the right person the first couple of times. There was a person on paper that we were supposed to talk to but he wasn't in. So then I mentioned Dan **, the very helpful person we talked to before. We got transferred to him and he was the best guy in the room. He's an attorney, really knows a lot, and figured it out for us - what we had to do with our taxes because we got disability issues. We didn't understand how we owed that money to our taxes and he explained everything. He also explained a little more about the issues that I had with Social Security which probably had nothing to do with Community Tax. It's as if I went to a lawyer and had to pay money just for an interview to tell him what's going on. I absolutely recommend Community Tax.
Community Tax was great. I trusted them to get everything done and they were very professional. They took a big load off my shoulders.
Before retaining the services of Community Tax Relief, I had 3 prior CPA's and a whole lot of problems. IRS, State, Franchise Tax Board, taxes needed to be redone. I owed more money they say than I made in over 10 years, interest, penalties, etc. The errors of former CPAs over and over again, my misfortune I believed what they told me meant the taxes needed to be redone and refiled, several years worth as a matter of fact. I had been misinformed by former CPAs on how to close a corporation, not getting the same answer twice talking to Franchise Tax Board, numbers never the same as to what they felt I owed, couldn't get anywhere with Fed or State, a tax lien that I did not owe had been filed and my credit trashed, threats to levy my accounts, seize property, etc. I was scared. Community Tax has stepped up and taken control on the various situations over the last couple years, the threats are not as scary. Some have already been removed and Community Tax has help me move forward so I can have a life again by settling out the old, cleaning up the mistakes, keeping me out of audit and they have communicated with the various entities for me so I don't have to. A huge relief! Miscommunications in the beginning of retaining Community Tax led to a complaint by me filed with BBB, and although several attempts have been made to remove it BBB has refused. Have asked BBB to update as to the current status with my relationship with Community Tax and they have again refused. So, for the record: Not only has Community Tax Relief stepped up and addressed all my issues immediately upon learning I believed there were problems, they have exceeded my expectations in the form of help and savings and attention. Unfortunately, the very firm that has helped me the most in the treacherous journey I've been on the last few years has a black mark from me on their record now as BBB refuses to update the report. It's been over 2 years now that I have retained Community Tax Relief and I will again and again. Special thanks to ** and ** and ** and ** as part of the team that is pulling me ahead and away from the problems and the threats. You people are a blessing and I appreciate you more than you probably know. Would I recommend Community Tax you may wonder? Yes, I would. Any company that hires people that care enough to step up when they have been made aware a consumer thinks something is wrong, jumps thru hoops to change that opinion and sticks by you is by far the best overall rating I could give a company. They not only have done their job for me but saved me from losing my home and the few things I have left. It is not a small deal to say they are by far the best I have found and without their assistance I don't know what would have become of my home and the few assets I have very honestly. They have done that for me and so much more. Negotiation of tens of thousands of dollars, negotiated and removed as my debt owed, bringing filings into compliance and speaking the very language with the authorities that would have taken me a second lifetime to have learned much less comprehend it all. In addition, they have taken my case to appeal for the injustices on the decisions of FTB, they have fought for me like no other.
I decided to connect with Community Tax because I needed to get my taxes in order and straightened out. The people are wonderful and they listen. They are very helpful, friendly, and work quickly. If I had an issue and I call them, they have an answer. One of their representatives was good on getting back in touch with me. Overall, they are efficient, professional and courteous.
if Community Tax ever need somebody going on TV and put their name out there, I’m the one for it because they have been great. I did have some trouble calling in and trying to find things out sometimes, which I understand that's going to be a problem, but that girl in there ** has done everything in the world for me. She has been a darling and never got upset with me. If anybody ever gets her, they had the best there is!
I had some outstanding tax that I needed to take care of so I decided to use Community. They now file my income tax and keep me up to date. My main contact with this company steers me in the right direction. Whenever I have questions or need to know something, somebody always responds to me within the day. I recommend them.
I'm still waiting for my taxes that Community Tax filed the extension on, and I haven't received them back yet. I wouldn't get too concerned until next month coz I know I got till the 15th of August but I was just surprised as normally they are really quick. But everything's been positive. The case worker I had was always responsive to any request that I had. They did a great job for me on my tax situation. I was really happy with them.
I reached out to Community Tax to get my tax problem worked out and I had a good experience with them. They did what they said they were going to do and I successfully completed the program and resolved my tax problems.
My daughter told me about the Community Tax because I had started with some other people here. I was in an abusive marriage situation and I lived in a couple of women shelters, one for almost two years. And when I came back, my husband passed away a few weeks after. There might have been a miscommunication during my first experience with them. But after that, Community Tax were awesome and so good for me. I would like to keep them on the top of my list for help. They took a load off my shoulders that was on it for years. I have successfully completed the Community Tax program. I have made two payments, a $186 fee and a $100 deposit which they applied. I went to them in Santa Ana because I didn't want anything to get messed up in the mail and I want to be sure that they have it in their system - right there in the IRS.
I had a problem with the IRS and someone told me about Community Tax so I decided to call them. Community Tax was pretty good. It helped me out a lot. I'm happy and would definitely recommend them.
Everything was outstanding. The first company that I got to resolve my tax problems wanted to deal with just my money. With Community Tax, it was a step-by-step process and everything worked out very well. Everything has resulted to whatever I wanted it to. I will use them again, but I'm not going to be in that situation. I will refer them to anybody that wants to know because they are excellent.
It was fine, it just took us a long time and a lot of money, but they got the job done.
It's their job but Community Tax took forever. Maybe that's just how it works but it was way too expensive. Other than that, I finally got the job done. But I would not recommend them. I'd try to find somebody local because it's just too hard trying do everything over the phone and mailing it and faxing it. I don't have a computer at home, so it was inconvenient. I have to go fax things all the time every time I get something from IRS. It's more trouble than having it here locally. I was satisfied with them but it would've been easier if it was here.
Community Tax did a great job for me. I didn’t have any issue with them at all. Even after I was finished with them and I already paid them and then some guy called me and tried to do a scam, they helped me for a half hour and didn’t ask for anything. I think that’s great. My case was closed months before that and they still helped me. It made me feel good about them.
They said all the right things and they came through exactly what they said. This year, I’m going to use a plan where I pay some money into an account every month so it will help me with my preparation coming up next year sometime, as a preemptive type of program to be ahead of the game. Community Tax has been great to me. They deserve a lot of credit.
I had some back taxes that I had to get settled up. I previously worked with another company that went out of business, and lost all my money with them. I then tried doing things on my own but it didn't work. So, I had the help of Community Tax. I'm already down to the last payment, and after that I am done. The people I worked with were nice and did everything they could to help me out. I would recommend them!
Community Tax was far better than the company I've worked with before. They were very thorough and dedicated in helping me resolve the tax issue I had with the IRS. Every question and concern that I have was answered. They were diligent in following through and getting the result fast. I was very pleased.
They didn't explain things like the way they were supposed to at the beginning. What I was told in the beginning and at the end were different things and there was a misunderstanding. But they helped me somehow and resolved my tax issue.
I was unsure at first with Community Tax. I expected as soon as they attach my payment they were going to disappear. I wasn't going to be able to find them online but they responded to every email I've sent, every question I've had. I'm very happy with them. I successfully completed the Community Tax program and the last thing I got from the IRS the taxes just disappeared. I am just not responsible for them. I have to not only make money, I have to continue to get my current taxes and pay them as needed. They did a good job.
Community Tax got my taxes lowered. However, when they said that they would mail it to me, it took a little longer than I expected to get it in the mail. But, it was fair so can't complain about them.
I have a problem with my tax from the IRS, so I went ahead and asked Community Tax to help and I was able to successfully complete the program. The people from Community tax were professional and helpful.
I've successfully completed the Community Tax program and they were very helpful and saved me a lot of money.
Most of the people at Community Tax have been pretty nice. About a week ago they called and talked about paying $80 down and $20 a month for the Community Tax but I don't really need that. I know what I need to do and I don't have that kind of money to be paying. But other than that, they are pretty much alright. They are good to work with and they help you. They get a lot of changes done and keep you from getting in more trouble.
It took seven years for Community Tax to settle my tax issues. They were very professional and knowledgeable. I paid them and they did their job.
Community Tax is as good as it gets. They took care of everything - they filed my income tax for me again this year after they handled the settlement thing for me. And everything went fine and it's kind of done deal for now. They were all very professional. I don't have any problem whatsoever with them.
Community Tax is absolutely fantastic. They kept me informed passively. They put the legal issues in terms so that regular people like me understand, so it was very easy to deal with.
I thank Community Tax for everything they did for me. I got less stress and I feel good about myself. I had gotten into trouble with the IRS and I didn’t know what I was going to do about it. I was sending paperwork in and still it weren’t enough for them so I started to get stressed out, having high blood pressure and all that kind of stuff. But one day, their commercial came on the TV and it was saying about Community Tax release so I called them. Everybody I talked to were so nice to me and helped me with everything. They followed up and kept me in contact with everything that was going on. I would tell anybody to call them and let them help because they’re so good.
I was having some problems as my landlord was taking me to court about one thing or another and I had been fighting with the IRS. I was trying to explain my frustration because at that point they wanted me to pay them. My husband and I are disabled. We have been paying the taxes since 2000 and they wanted me to pay them $425 a month from my check to settle the outstanding taxes, which I tried to explain to them was impossible. I was going back and forth about that. Then someone from Community Tax cold called me. She told me about Community and about their special but I told her I can’t do anything at that time because of all the problems I have and that I have no money. She then told me I can send her $50 at that point and then we could do a payment plan and they will work with me. The IRS tried to put me through the wringer and I’m the type of person that keeps very detailed records of everything I do. So every time they throw out those road blocks, I have the answer. I have the paper trail. The finalization is that Community Tax came to an agreement with the IRS, seeing how I had been paying them for over 13 years and I wasn’t getting any place with the actual taxes because of the penalties, the late charges and all these other nonsense. It seems when I was sending them $125 I was actually paying all of that and $10 was coming off of the taxes. They gave me an agreement for $250, which I paid off on March 4 and they took my tax return on 2013 and 2014. But after that I absolutely never want to see the IRS again except the ones we have. When I filed for my taxes this year, they took $1800 from my federal return but that’s alright. At least next year I don’t have to worry about it if I get anything back. I thank the Lord everyday, from that point on, for me listening and taking the person from Community Tax’s advice. She and her staff were very comforting and helpful. She said, “You have any problems, once they send out the payment plan and everything, just let us know. We can help you. We can work with you.” They did. Community Tax is first rate.
They are the greatest. They were very professional, on point from A to Z and completed the job. I was really pleased with their work even though I was kind of afraid because I was overly taken by another company for another reason, not for tax. They got my money and do really good work. I have recommended Community Tax since and I've been talking about it.
I was plenty satisfied with what I had done with Community Tax. There were a couple of times I tried to get in touch and talk to somebody but it seemed like I always had to wait for them to call back. Sometimes I got a little frustrated when I had to wait so long but other than that everything went fine.
We had some unresolved tax issues. It's the first time we had to deal with the IRS and it was scary in the beginning because we were traumatized due to the huge amount. By the time we talked to Community Tax, I felt more at ease. They were not lying and they did not build castles in the air. They were very realistic and they told me to be patient. They say it will look good so there's no need to panic. As a matter of fact, by the end of the resolution, it did not just look good, it looked great! We went from owing $60,000 to the US Government to getting back $24,000 from the US Government. They did a great job. But it took a while - a whole year and a half - so some of their people quit and we got another people to work with. They said they're taking over the files. But we're very happy with all of them. It was a great experience and I hope I don't have to have to do it again, but if I have to, I'll be using them again. I'll be suggesting them to others.
Two people in particular made my experience with Community Tax very good. I was very pleased with the service and results I got.
I went with Community Tax because taxes have been too much to pay. I knew I wasn't going to be able to pay it all and pay what they wanted me to pay monthly; it was next to impossible. I've completed their program and it was a good service. They were awesome. They helped me in everything I needed help with. There was a point where I wasn't able to pay the last payment with the IRS because I didn't have enough time. They called and got their lawyer for me and gave me more time. They were also very friendly. It was a good experience and helpful.
I was pleased with Community Tax for doing an awesome job! I went with them for my IRS issue and now I'm paid in full.
I needed help and talked to a couple other companies but decided on Community Tax because they were the most reputable. They did what they promised and they're good at what they do.
My experience with Community Tax was good as far as the process. Every time I called to know something, someone was always available or someone would always call me back. And when I needed an email about how much I owe or what I had left, they were right there to support me. They were knowledgeable on what was going on. Now, I’m done paying but then I thought they were supposed to keep the IRS off of me for a minute. I just got through paying March, last month, and now the IRS is already sending me something like, "Pay or we're going to get you".
I had an IRS audit and tried to resolve that debt on our own but was unsuccessful, so I needed to have somebody represent me. Community Tax sent me a mail solicitation, so I contacted them. This was our first experience working with somebody and they were great! We were able to resolve our debt issues as well as file our tax return for that audit. And we've had great interactions with them. They informed us all the way along what was going on, were good negotiators, and the price was reasonable. They were very helpful, all the way along - from soup to nuts. I would absolutely recommend them.
Community Tax seemed to be the most honest and fair people to deal with. I talked to a few other people before I chose them and I did try it on my own and as usual, the federal government kind of shut me down, trying to work directly with me. The gentleman from Community Tax, on many occasions, kept me in line on what was going on and everything that was being done. He did notify me and let me know what was going on with the actions. We have an offer and compromise and I just have until August to pay off what I owe the federal government. All I can say is if you owe the federal government $80,000 and you're having problem settling it, Community Tax is your best route because on that bill I settled for $628. They did a great job. That’s why I have recommended them and a friend of mine is going through their system now.
I'm so glad I found Community Tax. When I got laid off from Verizon in 2010 I had been there right at 10 years so I had a severance package. What I didn't know is that the time when the check was cut, Verizon did not take any taxes out. So when I went ahead and filed my taxes no big deal! The next year, the IRS contacted me saying I owe them close to $20,000. I didn't have that amount just sitting around somewhere. That's when I thought I have to find somebody to help me because I can't go to prison and I don't want my house taken. And that's when I reached out to Community Tax because I just didn't know where else to go or who to call. I did successfully complete their program. And this year, when I filed my taxes, the IRS stated that I had a tax debt, which I knew I did not because I had just gone through the program with Community Tax. So even though they were no longer representing me at the time, because I had already paid my settlement and whatnot, I reached out to them in a panic again, asking them what’s going on. And telling them the IRS is taking my income tax again. This would have been the third year in a row. So even though they were not representing me anymore because I had already paid the settlement, they were still willing at no charge to contact the IRS to find out what was going on if I didn't get it resolved myself. And I thought that was awesome because they didn't have to do that. My payments were due on a specific date. I could call ahead and say, "Hey! Look, I just got paid today. Let me go ahead and withdraw the funds." I didn't have to wait until my payment due date to make my payments. I always got an email confirmation letting me know that the payment transaction had gone through. They were awesome! If I had questions because it's not like I'm a worrywart. It's just that when the IRS has your name, you want to make sure you do everything in your power to do exactly what is being asked of you. Nothing less. I would send an email. I'd get a response back in a day or I'd get a phone call, whichever it was. Because when you're working, you can't always get called at work. So I would say, "Send me an email and I'll check it on my phone." When I first called them and they were telling me about the fees, I was like in disbelief, crying. The guy from Community Tax was like, "No, no, no! Don’t panic! We'll work with you." There's no possible way I could've just come out of my pocket and say "Whammo! Here's the money!" because if that's the case, I could've paid the IRS. So I'm really impressed with Community Tax’s service. I don't know how I would have got through it without them. They went beyond what they needed to do. I'm in customer service myself. I work for one of the big lenders and loss mitigation and I know how it is when people are in a bind. They don't know which way to turn and it's so good to get somebody on the phone who's going to listen to you, let you vent, let you talk, and then, "Okay. This is what we are going to do." That was really important to me.
It was for tax purposes that I connected with Community Tax. I had problems so I decided to have them do it for me. We got it resolved and everything was taken care of. They explained everything that I needed to know and talked to me and called, texted me on whatever they needed to do or when they needed to. It was a good experience.
I was having all kinds of threatening things about liens and other things in my business so I got in touch with Community Tax and they were able to resolve my tax issues. It took about two years but I'm glad it's finally over and I can move on now. Everybody there was pretty professional. It cost a lot of money but it saved me a lot of money too.
I decided to connect with Community Tax because I have owed several years of income tax to the Internal Revenue Service. I successfully completed the Community Tax program to resolve my tax issues. I've had interactions with a few of them there at Community Tax. It had been a situation where we had a breakdown in communication and we had lost track of one another. They had resolved my situation with the Internal Revenue the first time around and I hadn't been notified that it had been resolved. I became a little testy because I had lost my job at the time and I just felt that they had abandoned me since they hadn't continued with my case as I couldn't pay them, which wasn't the case because they did continue with it and they did come to an understanding with the IRS. It's just that I hadn't been notified of this understanding at the time. When I explained to them that the IRS had notified me that I had defaulted on the agreement that they had reached on my account, they were very helpful and receptive. They got in touch with the IRS. They explained to them that the error in communication wasn't my fault, and they resolved an even better agreement with the Internal Revenue than the first one. They got me an offer for a compromise that I thought, at first, was really a fraud. I was like, "That's impossible because I owed about $203,000.00 in back taxes, penalties and fines," and Community Tax got me an offer in compromise for $100.00.
I completed everything with Community Tax. It was satisfactory - they did a great job in communicating with the IRS. Interaction with them was good from start to completion. I had a good initial conversation with one of the vice presidents in setting up the agreement for the installment payments of the fee involved. And then, while the offered compromise is in the preparation stage, I did communicate about three times with the attorney who was in charge of putting everything together. At the end, they represented me in a very timely fashion with the IRS to finalize the offered compromise. The response time at each stage of the preparation and the submission of the offering compromise was very timely - I was impressed with that. I had a very rewarding experience with Community Tax.
Community Tax so far helped me out. It's better than I thought it was. I'm on my final payment with the federal government so everything worked out to my advantage with their help. They knew exactly what they were doing. Although I wasn't expecting the extra payment because I just thought I was done. They sent me the mail and said, "Just mail this off and they might come back with an offer." They wanted to come back with an offer but they gave me another offer for $500. So I said, "Okay, as long as the debt is out, I can go on, move on. I'll be okay." They said I still owed like $29,000. But no, it worked out to my advantage. Right now, I'm satisfied, $46,000 to nothing. I didn't know about the program Community Tax offers had I not heard about them on the radio. There are people who should be taking on this program and I will refer if I know of any people who are in my situation. I’m very pleased with Community Tax.
Community Tax was overpriced. It didn't save me any money. I still ended up paying. That's 1,800 bucks that I gave them for getting into the $120.00 a month payment program with the IRS. It cost me 1,800 bucks to do what I could've done myself in the first place to get in the payment program. I spent $1,800.00 for nothing. The ad made it sound a lot better than it turned out to be. It’s all said and done. The last payment for my student loan was today, so that's paid off too.
Community Tax was hired to handle an issue I was was having with the IRS and get me a settlement which they did successfully. I'm not convinced that they were the cheapest for that service that I could have hired. Specifically, I thought some of the accounting work they did were kind of high priced. I used to get my taxes done around here for $350 to $400. Community Tax did five separate returns for me and charged me like 2500 bucks - that was a little high. But overall, they got me the resolution that I needed. So in that regard, I was happy with them. I have mixed feelings about the whole thing though. They did the right job for a cost that I thought was higher than I might have paid if I found somebody who would do the same thing (some local people here could also do that kind of thing). Nevertheless, I could say that it was a positive experience.
I was having tax problems and I applied for a whole year to solve it on my own. That didn't work, and I had turned to Community Tax. I was fortunate to call the right company and got the results that I wanted. It did take a few years to get everything completely right but that was just the process, so it was worth it. Their team was all good. When I first started, the guy who was on the case who assisted, he would call me every week or two just to keep me updated, keep me from worrying. If I ever had a question, I would call and everything was handled correctly. I never had a problem. Well, you're dealing with the IRS and they say that you owe over 40-something thousand dollars. You're at their mercy because they have more power than the President, practically. They can do a lot of things to you. Community Tax Relief took that burden off me, it was a huge relief to have some help and have the right help. At the end, I had different resolutions and then finally, I got a permanent one and I'm really, really happy with that, really grateful. It's hard to get an offer in compromise so it all turned out well for me, but you can't go against the IRS yourself. You have to have professionals, and I just feel like everybody at Community Tax Relief was professional and did the right thing at the right time. And I feel fortunate because there's a lot of companies out there that would take your money and not do what they say they're gonna do and then you're out with that money. I have no complaints at all.
The Team that helped to resolve some tax issues that I have had for years, and were very dedicated to helping me through the difficulties in such case. Though I have had a few different case managers, and like **, they all worked diligently and rectified my tax situation. I would recommend Community Tax Relief to family and friends who are in need of serious tax help.
I owed the Internal Revenue Service for tax years 2006, 2007 and 2008 over $66,000 dollars. Community Tax Relief got them to settle for $500.00! That's right, $500.00! So pick up the phone, give them a call or email them - they're waiting to hear from you!
I tried them out and successfully completed the Community Tax program. Down to the first phone call I made, they were very professional and knowledgeable. And every other person that I go through with each stage were very nice to me always. It's been great.
My experience with Community Tax wasn’t good at first but then they got on top of it, and did an excellent job with the right people. The guys who work there were amazing and really took care of me.
They have resolved my complaint and are doing my taxes this year.
In the beginning it was great. They did a really great job. Everybody was friendly, everybody was professional. But after that, I'm so frustrated with their company. They worked on my IRS case wherein they did a really great job and I paid the money they asked for which was $3,000. But after that, they told me that I have to do the tax with them every year, which was okay. Last month, we made a deal. I was supposed to show up there with my paper for the 2014 income tax and hand down $495 cash so they can do my taxes for this coming year. Then they keep bothering me. Every weekend they would ask for money. I talked to **, I talked to **, I talked to this girl. I said “I don’t understand why you guys keep calling and keep asking for money if you guys don’t even start my taxes yet? It’s not like I owe you some money. You guys don’t even start doing my taxes and you guys are already asking for money.” I got really mad because the agents are not doing any of my taxes and are asking for money up front! I'm a truck driver and I travel all over the country. They called me four times last month and I keep telling them that I'll call them back and will be bringing them the paperwork for 2014 plus $495 cash when I come to Chicago. Two days ago, another phone call again, asking for $500 not knowing what it was for. It’s not like I don’t have money. I’m gonna pay the $500 tomorrow, just give me the account where you want me to send the money, but it’s not professional to keep asking for money to do the taxes for someone. I told ** two nights ago, “If you guys call me one more time, you can have my paperwork and I’m going to somebody else.” And they are charging so much money, $500 to do income tax for you. I don’t think it’s right but I still go for it, but now that they keep begging for money and looking like debt collectors, I’m thinking not to do income tax with them. Usually they charge anybody $400 and they’re like, “We’re charging everybody $500 but we have special now, we give you $50 off.” I was like, “There are still agencies out there who are doing tax for $200. What kind of percentage off are you giving me?” Moreover, they even lost my papers! How can you lose the original paper when I give them all my receipts, all my bills? I give them everything and they just make a copy and throw my original receipts away. I'm now thinking of looking for somebody else to do my taxes. I feel bad that I have recommended them to 70 people already, including my own sister. I'm really upset at them. They have to do the job right. This isn't how you're supposed to treat customers. I'm not going to recommend them to somebody anymore. Not happy with Community Tax at all.
Community Tax was pretty cool. I initially called them because my tax was pretty screwed up. I first tried to contact some other company to solve the issue for me but it didn't work out. I fell behind doing that, so I just thought maybe I needed to find somebody. Their people were very helpful and courteous with me. If I missed their call, they called me right back. They got my tax issue straightened for me and I'd recommend them to somebody.
Community Tax was excellent. I was pleased. They were easy to reach and stayed in contact. Bottom line was they got a result that I wanted, so I'm happy.
I had a tax debt. The first company I went to didn’t work with me like Community Tax did. Everybody there was helpful and friendly. I'm so thankful that they helped me with it otherwise I don't know what I would have done.
I was behind on my taxes and Community Tax did an excellent job in resolving my tax issues. The people there were very polite and very, very well organized - great people to work with. I didn't have a problem at all with any of them. If I knew anyone that had a problem with their taxes, they're the first people I would probably tell them about.
I had some tax problems and Community Tax resolved it. Their team called me and got my questions answered and what they wanted, and they were always professional.
I completed the Community Tax program. It was helpful. I will recommend them.
I called Community Tax because I had a tax problem and wanted to see if they could help with that... and they have. Their team members were real good, helpful and did a pretty good job. Community Tax took a lot of pressure off me.
Everybody at Community Tax were professional and knew what they were doing. They resolved my issue and it was pretty successful dealing with them.
I'd recommend them. I didn’t have any bad experience with Community Tax. It was great.
My experience has been real good and I'm very grateful. They helped me out. In the beginning I had a payment plan and I finished paying it off and I was always having to call. But I went personally to the office, I get that I had to go there, and they were very helpful. After I went they would regularly call me to let me know what was going on, and it was a lot better than before.
My account manager was wonderful and everything is good with Community Tax.
A talk show host that I had great respect for recommended Community Tax. The CPA, Dennis **, was the one person there that I trust more than anybody else. Some of the other people I dealt with, I wasn't real happy with, but Dennis is the one that actually filled out my forms and everything. He kept me happy when the other people didn't. He went the extra mile. The bad things that happened, Dennis took care of them, and now, whenever I have a question, I can call him directly and I don't have to go through some of the other people that I didn't wanna mess with anymore. It wasn't always an excellent experience. There were some people that I got angry with. But once I got a hold of Dennis and he did what he said he would do, he kept coming back and keep me informed. When you go there, sometimes you need somebody to hold your hand, and that's basically what he did. Some of the others didn't do that. When I first started working with them, they sent me these big packages, stuff to fill out and I said, "Well, I could fill all this out. I could file my taxes on my own." And I finally got somebody to break it down in smaller chunks where I could handle it.
Community Tax did everything for me. They did a great work and it was an excellent experience.
I had bad tax debt that I had to take care of so I availed of Community Tax's services. Everybody was polite and did everything fine - I generally had no problems with them. The only thing that I was unhappy about with them was when I okay-ed it, I sent them the $499 or so to get started on things. But then a couple weeks later, when I'm talking to them again, they said I was paid in full. As it turns out, they took money ($4,900 + the initial $499) out of my account without telling me. But other than this issue, they handled everything well.
I have successfully completed the Community Tax program to resolve my tax issues (I was having problems with the IRS). Their team was friendly, courteous and very helpful, and it took little time.
The Community Tax was really good. They tend to everything, all our needs, helped out a lot. Specifically, the attention to detail and then really making sure what was going on, and what exactly was gonna be done.
Community Tax was very good. They kept me updated and in the loop on everything. They got everything in, and then finally got down to a decision to be made, and it was done real quick. I thoroughly enjoyed working with them.
I went online and found Community Tax's number. They said it would take approximately six months to complete but they kept losing my paperwork. Lost three or four times. The person that was handling it supposedly quit and then took all the paperwork with her so I had to get it altogether again. In the meantime, I found out she hadn't quit. She was just on vacation. So instead of six months, it went to almost two years. By that time, business had turned around, so they wouldn't work with us. The IRS wouldn't. I couldn't recommend them at all.
Superb! Community Tax's attention to details is the best I've ever seen of any organization I've ever been in or associated with, either military or civilian. I've emailed their president and everybody involved. I even put a comment up on the Better Business Bureau, so people can read it all there. It's all been very, very positive.
I needed help with my taxes and Community Tax has treated me very, very well. I tried doing it on my own, paying it monthly and would probably be paying it for years and years and years. I just thank God for a company like Community Tax, who can help people. If any words can express my joy on how they helped me, they are great. It was a very good experience. Daniel, the guy that's been working with me is very professional in what he does. They gave me all types of knowledge, information that I need to do in the future to keep myself out of trouble again. Whoever needs help with their back taxes, I will recommend to Community Tax.
Community Tax filed my income tax for me this year. The entire team, it didn't matter whether it was Daniel ** or one of the administrative clerks or whoever it happened to be, they all had a great deal of respect. They didn't make me feel like a piece of crap. They took it as a very serious thing that needed to be handled. They explained everything thoroughly and were courteous and polite. I really can't say enough good about them because they're just a fantastic team. It started out stressful because of the issue, of course, and they made me feel confident and relaxed.
I’m going through a bad spot right now but Community Tax were great. It was an excellent experience, and I would recommend them.
I'm very pleased with the work that Community Tax did for me. I owed IRS money that I'm not in the position to be able to pay, and it was a big burden on me. I tried to resolve my tax problem on my own but I wasn't able to. I showed IRS what my income was and they just said, "Well, okay, pay $300 a month." But I didn't have $300 a month given the income that I had. Community Tax gave me a timeline of how the process works and they kept it up to the end. They would send me paperwork and say, "Okay, I would like you to have this done and to have it done by this time." Sometimes I didn't get it to them on time but they still called me, kept reminding me by email or phone call until I got the paperwork done. It's worked out and I'm very pleased. As a matter of fact, I have called a friend who I know needs their service.
Community Tax handled my tax problems well and I don't have that headache anymore.
I had a tax problem so I called Community Tax to get some information on how they can fix it. The team did a good job - they made it pretty simple and easy for me. They say that a lot of people don't get the result that I got so I'm happy. It was a very good outcome.
I worked with a CPA when I had my own business and we did one year, and I was freaked. It was overboard because I had employees and stuff. He was part of the reason that I went bankrupt that first year because I was paying so much taxes on everything that I had no money to keep my bills going. The Community Tax contacted me because my tax problems were so big that apparently the IRS could tell them who was in big trouble. The people there were always very nice and helpful. I never had any problems with them. They made things real easy. I didn't have a whole lot of contact with them because they were able to take care of most of it themselves. So it worked pretty easy. I had overnight some stuff to them a couple times but that was about the worst thing I had to do. I have successfully completed the Community Tax program to resolve your tax issues. I still have a couple more payments to make to the IRS, but they're not even a tenth of what it would have been. They got all the resolutions done, and they're doing 14 for me too. My experience with them was very easy and efficient.
Tax filing had been weighing on me and I said I had to do something so I called Community Tax. It was the first thing I tried and I have resolved my tax issues and I'm paid up. Everything is good and they sent me a paper to release my link. My first contact was with Mike **. He said they had a team that was working on my case and to just keep texting everything that I had and any correspondence that I had further with the IRS – fax that to them. Everybody was always courteous. If they didn't know my case, they would look my case up and tell me the last time I spoke to someone and what they needed. It was set up efficiently. I had fallen behind on my payments to them and they arranged a compromise payment. If I wasn't able to pay, they called me up "The payment's due. What's going on? When do you think you can pay? How much can you pay?" They pushed my payment back and moved them around. That was cool. Community tax is a stress reliever. When I first called, I was just stressed out because the IRS was pretty aggressive, but they talked me down and got the stress off me.
My experience with Community Tax was excellent. My husband was on the road and he was an owner-operator. I got in a mess with income tax. We were paying the IRS and weren't really getting anywhere because we're still paying interest and financing. Nothing was ever going down. I had seen them advertised on TV and I took the number down. I called and got this guy Larry that's in the department that takes care when you first start. He said, "I think we can help you." They are one hell of a company. I do my taxes with them now and haven't let them go. I still deal with them. They're the type of people that if you have a problem, they'll help you. We had to pay a certain amount of money to get it started. They waited. They made us pay in payments to get us done while they're still doing the work for us. They're excellent. I have no problems with them.
My experience with Community Tax wasn't that bad. I was trying to get a settlement where it was over with. They'll take my taxes at the end of the year every year now. We had it set up to where I was gonna pay $60 a month til I got caught up them. After two years or so, they come back and reevaluate the situation. It's like they put it on hold. I don't quite understand it but it looks good. I know they held them off as far as garnishing my wages. I won't know for two years what Community Tax has done for me. Is it gonna cost me another $3,000 something for them to do the same thing again? Until I got to that point of seeing the outcome of the whole situation is to me, they'll take my taxes until it drops off in 2019 or by the time they take my taxes for five years. Add the $3,000 something that I paid Community Tax and it seems like it's about the same thing. It's just making a payment plan with the IRS. Hope it doesn't end up costing me more than what I owned the IRS from the get-go. It's hard to tell though. Sometimes I think I just paid $3,600 something for a two-year extension. I could have called the IRS and told them "Hey, I wanna start making payments" and made them a $60 payment, and at $100 a month that's $1,200 a year. It would have worked out just about the same. Now if this situation goes out to where they just take my income tax and they only end up getting less than $6,000 or $2,000 which I highly doubt, then it would be a good situation. But I don't feel that the situation's gonna turn out as good as what they claim whenever they're talking on TV.
Community Tax has worked with me for years and they did a great job for me. They saved me a lot of money and I had a great experience.
I had a good experience with Community Tax. All the interactions I had were good. The contact was there. The followup was good. When I expected the followup, I got it and when there were things that changed that I needed to know about, they made me aware of it. They took care of my problem. There's some outfits that will do only your federal and it's up to you to pay state. Community Tax took care of federal and state which is a real positive thing because in California, the Franchise Tax Board will never let go of you. The only complaint I had was on the initial where a firm in Texas got me on to see if I was qualified and they charged me $1200. And then once I was qualified, they turned me over to Chicago and charged me a fee and it wasn't clear what was going on. That was the only thing that was a problem for me. They got me off the hook for thousands of dollars. But I was happy with that. I’d recommend them.
Community Tax was a very beautiful program for me. They helped me clean up all my state and my federal tax. They settled my debt of $2500 for $500. I was pleased with all the services. I told a couple of my friends. I think the program is unique. They got a plan for everybody. The experience with them was very satisfactory and exuberating for me because they were taking all my money--they took $17,000 on my bank--and they really got me back on track and I really appreciate all the things they've done for me.
I had a good experience with Community Tax. I had a problem with my back taxes. I owe a lot of taxes and was getting stressed with losing property and stuff like that. Community Tax took care of me. No problem at all. I didn't have to do nothing but just take care of what I had to take care of with the IRS to finalize everything. Other than that, everything else is good.
The whole process with Community Tax took time, but it ended up getting taken care of. At the beginning, I had to go do certain things that weren't mentioned and then had to go back and forth for a few things. But it ended up pretty good.
The service from Community Tax is good. They did everything they said they would and saved me a lot of money so I really didn't have any kind of problem. At the end of this year, things will be totally done and complete. The team was quite helpful and kept me informed as to how things were going with the IRS. Once I gave them all the information they needed, they jumped in and took care of everything and kept me updated as to how it was going. I will recommend them to other people.
I have successfully completed the Community Tax program. The only thing left is for me to do my part as far as the payments and they had reduced it suitably. They are nice and have always been very willing to help me out in whatever situation I was at the time. I appreciate the services they provide and would definitely recommend them.
I was at work and got a phone call from Community Tax. I've completed my tax program. I made a mistake with the setup but they explained everything to me. I could call them anytime I want to when I needed to ask them something. I was never put on hold when I called. They always referred me to another person and didn't leave me with a question in mind. They were a team and they're like a family - true to their word and second to none.
Community Tax is good. I enjoyed the experience. I had doubts mostly all the way through but when things started happening, I was like, "Hey, this really does work." I don't owe the government anymore. I owed them for years and it was something that was really making me old because you know the government can take your money and there's nothing you can do.
I would recommend Community Tax. My experience with them was good. I like the fact that whatever they promised me, they kept true with their promise. They came through.
I was checking them out and they seemed viable, and I needed their services. Community Tax did a great job so far. We're still in the process of completing the tax program. I'm very pleased with their staff. They responded on time, did what they said they were going to do, and kept their promises.
I was looking for assistance with tax debts online and found Community Tax. I used the tax return preparation. They did everything in-house and prepared our returns the whole time. They were very good with follow-up. Especially Kelly ** was very helpful and very attentive when we did our final resolution. It was a great experience with Community Tax.
I went online to check out Community Tax and one of the main reasons I contacted them was because I didn't know anything about tax and wanted some help desperately because IRS was on my back. I worked with another company before but their prices were outrageous. With Community Tax, it's been excellent. I successfully completed the tax program which resolved my tax issues. They're the best.
Everything was so good with Community Tax. It was kind of long and hard to deal with, but in the end, everything come up with a really nice deal. My experience has been good. It was very nice. I'd recommend them.
I knew I had a problem and had heard some of the success stories with Community Tax and other clients. They were very good and kept in touch with me, kept me updated about everything, so their service was excellent. Once they got a hold of me and I returned their call and vice versa, if I had questions I called them and they would get back to me.
I tried other companies but they said I didn't qualify. Somebody told me about Community Tax and when they looked at everything, she said I qualified and assisted me until I'm done. They were very good. Everything they said they were gonna do was done. I would recommend them to anybody.
Community Tax offered me the best help and they took care of all my issues. I have successfully completed their program. Everything they did was a big help and they were always there for me. They completed everything and did it the way I expected it to be done. They were great and have been very professional and very knowledgeable. There was one particular person there that directed what I needed to be done. Even to this day if I have any questions, I always call and they always give me the best advice they can. I am very happy that they were able to take care of all my tax problems and very appreciative of it. They did a fantastic job.
So far, Community Tax has been excellent towards me. Everything has been going great and everything they said, they did. I can’t say anything bad about them. They did a very good job on my behalf.
I heard about Community Tax on a talk show on the radio (I'm a truck driver) and had issues that I needed to get squared away so I contacted them. I had tried to resolve my tax problems on my own and I had all of my paperwork and everything done. But it was only through my successful completion of the Community Tax program that I was able to resolve my issues. Everything was great. I didn't have to worry about anything. I got them all the paperwork and they just took it from there. They took care of what I needed.
Community Tax was pretty good and did everything that they needed to do. They were good with me. When I called, they return my call and there was good communication between us. Everything worked out great.
I am satisfied with my experience with Community Tax.
Community Tax really helped me out a lot. It took some time to clear it up but it took a load off our shoulders, and I'm back to ground zero and moving forward. Another tax year now and I'm moving forward with my new tax accountant and things are going really well. I appreciate very much the things that they are able to help me out with - IRS and stuff like that were tearing me apart there for a while. I haven't heard from them for a while and I hope when I do everything's still okay. Community Tax was pretty patient with me and that was a good experience. We all need to learn to be patient. They were very patient and very, very thorough. The expense was all worth it.
Community Tax accomplished what they said they would do for me. The experience with them was positive.
I hired CTR when it seemed my world was coming to an end. My team at CTR set my world back on its axis. You can take everything they tell you to the bank - they fulfill all their promises and more. I no longer live in the shadows waiting for the IRS and CA FTB boogie men to come and get me. Hire this company if you hire anyone!
My taxes were delinquent. I needed help and decided to connect with Community Tax. I completed their two-step program. The team was good, courteous and kind.
I was having IRS problems, so I called Community Tax to see if they could help me out. They kept me informed with everything going on and gave me a fair resolution. They respond to you promptly. If you leave a message, they get right back to you and email you. They had my interest well at hand. Being that they’re located in a different state from me, they made me feel important the way we worked together.
I had a good experience with Community Tax, it's been so long since I have completed one of their tax programs. I was having tax problems on my account and I asked them if they could solve it for me. Megan is just wonderful and so were the rest of the Community Tax team. The young man that worked on my taxes, he was excellent, I couldn't have worked with a better person. They did exactly what they say they're going to do and they're very good at it. I recommend Community Tax.
Community Tax did a good job for me and got my problems resolved. They were very good. They made things easy. I got a busy schedule and Community Tax worked with me around that, and all is well. I would recommend them.
I contacted Community Tax because I owed the IRS money and felt they would help me, which they did. They were very professional and very knowledgeable. They were super good to me and worked with me on everything. They are awesome.
I had a lot of back taxes that needed to be resolved and I didn't want to pay the full amount. I couldn't pay the full amount and Community Tax worked with me to get it resolved. I worked with another company before but I wasn't happy with it. The team from Community Tax was very helpful, answered my questions and researched if they didn't know the answer. They told me the paperwork I needed. I got it together and sent it to them and they represented me through the whole thing. I was very happy because I couldn't have done it without them. The experience was very satisfactory.
I first heard about Community Tax on the radio. This is my first time dealing with something like that. I was having some issues. The IRS was writing me letters. So, I gave them a call and they did some investigation and they said they believe they can help me out on the facts that they got from the investigation, they came through. I talked with a team member at Community Tax. We communicated quite a bit and he told me what was needed and he turned me over to one of his associates. They told me what they needed and I faxed it to them and they had it done. They are very professional and they did it in a timely fashion, too.
I love Community Tax. All the people that work there are awesome. In the beginning, it started off a little rocky but whenever they finally figured out what was going on, they have really been totally on the spot since then. They've been really helpful when it became very, very stressful for me. They go out, above and beyond their call of duty, they are fast and efficient. Right now they're still watching things going on with our tax but their part of it is done and now it's just a maintenance program.
My experience with Community Tax is really good. I really like it that they would get back to me in a timely fashion. They're very professional and very courteous.
Community Tax is a company who cares about people who get themselves in financial situations where it seems that there's no way out. I first heard about them from my first sister, when she gave my mother a number to call. My mother sought for Community Tax's services because she had a debt she couldn't pay. This was myself and my mother's first time to use such services and the team members were awesome! I talked with 2 or 3 different males who were all awesome in the resolution. Their professionalism and the manner in which they handled my mother's case was a huge plus for me. Of course, I have to provide all the documents that they needed and I didn't mind doing that since it was as easy as faxing them a copy of my Power of Attorney and informed them either e-mail or text message was the best way to contact me. I'm truly grateful for that. After Community Tax sent us a case closed letter, a month later, we received a letter from the IRS asking for a payment. I just made them a copy of the case closed letter and sent it to them.
Community Tax was my lifesaver and I love them. I got in contact with them because I was behind in my taxes. I had not paid them and didn’t know what to do. We’ve got it all resolved and they accepted by offering compromise. I am absolutely elated with the company. They did a very professional job. They prepared all my taxes and helped me understand how to do it. They set me up where I pay every week to IRS through my checking account so I’m always paid up. The team members are very helpful and always there when I needed them. They were able to do what they said they would do.
My overall experience with Community Tax was excellent. I like the service and the people who answered the phone. They are efficient. They deleted my account with IRS and I earned $46,000. I don’t have to pay in full because they helped me very much.
I contacted Community Tax to see what they could do for me. It’s all been taken cared of. I might use them to file this year. The team members were super awesome. We talked about what I was going to have to pay and if things didn’t work out, they’d walk me through the whole thing. It's almost $20,000 less the fees, and they charged me with $3,000 so almost $15,000 removed. I was pleased with that. If you need someone to help you out, call them. They did what they said they’re going to do and they alleviated a lot of my anguish.
My experience with Community Tax was great. I had tax problems with the IRS and tried it on my own at first but it didn’t work. After I heard about them on the radio, I decided to give them a call. Each person that I talked to did exactly what they said they were going to do and they were right on point with it. You just tell them what you need and they take care of it. They do not prolong it and are easy to work with. You give them all the documents they need and they’re on it.
I first learned about Community Tax on the internet. I contacted them because of the tax amount that I owed. My issue is temporarily for right now resolved, no corrections status. I've had a couple of discussions with a couple of people and they've been very helpful. It's a good service and they deal with the government but since it's not a permanent fix I'm still kinda worried about when they've done all they can do and the government still continues to pursue it. I called them over this past weekend and they were not in the office on the weekends. I left messages on two numbers that I called but nobody ever called me back. I told them that it was urgent. When they didn't call me after the weekend was over, that kind of discouraged me a lot because I had someone calling me and telling me that I was going to be arrested and put in jail. Because I was at work, it really disturbed me to get a call like that, so I called them to tell them what had happened, and they never returned my call. Just talking to my sister, I realized that's a scam, trying to get me to make a payment because the IRS don't do that. and calmed down. All in all, Community Tax knows what they do.
I got the number for Community Tax off the TV and called them because I owed a lot in taxes. I tried to work with other companies before and even tried to resolve my tax problem on my own. Community Tax came up with a payment plan and I’m making payments but it's not fully resolved. Their team members were all good at first and I thought they were very thorough, efficient and did what they said they were going to do.
I had been stressing over the IRS situation. I was in a payment plan that I knew when I set up, I was not able to follow through with and pay my taxes regularly. This was getting to me to have the money and I can't pay my bills, and that is what led me to looking for other resources. When I heard about them on the radio, I told myself to give them a call. I spoke to a lady who was very nice. She did quick things that could help me and explained the situation. I did some research and I was not thrilled with some of the research that I found out, so I sent an email to say "thank you for your time" because at that point in time I was not going to select them as representative for me on the tax issue based on information I was provided. I was probably one of the most scared, apprehensive persons. I don't need them to take my check because I go paycheck to paycheck. About an hour later she replied, "Thank you, good luck," whatever, and about an hour later, I got an email from the co-owner telling me that he understands my position and stuff like that and he explained to me how the process worked. He's very, very polite. He explained to me the rating systems a little bit and he really eased my mind. Because he personally took an effort by responding through email and giving me his direct line for any questions or concerns, some of them don't personally take an interest in their business and it just seems they want the money, I thought I'd give it a shot. I called them, and he was very good with explaining how the process works and telling me what I needed to do. I hired them and I was very, very pleased with their performance and professionalism. Their payment plan is where I could pay because they really understand that it's really hard to come up with extra money to pay them. I have nothing bad to say; I have nothing but good. They're excellent.
I had a great experience with Community Tax. Their advertisement sounded good and I went for it. And I feel that all of them are in it to make money but I said I’d give these people a try. It was a rough two years but they handled it like experts and professionals. They told me anytime I had a problem, if I get anything in the mail, to send it to them and they would take care of it. Then they sent me the forms that it was resolved. I was just worried for two years, and I didn’t know they were going to do that good, and they did. At my age, I owed like $68,000 and I can’t pay but they got it fixed. I spent over $7,000 with them and it was worth it. I got the darn thing off of my back. I’d rate them excellent without a doubt.
It was a very good experience that I had with Community Tax. They’re professional and very nice to me. They solved my problems. As far as me having to pay more on what I owed, I just got to make sure that each year that I won’t have an IOU... but I think this year I am because I was trying to pay the lawyers off at the time. I just need to save up some money so I can nip it in the bud when it does come.
I have successfully completed the two-step-program with Community Tax and had my tax situation resolved.
Everybody in Community Tax is nice and very accommodating.
I heard about Community Tax on the radio and contacted them because I needed help. I tried to resolve it myself, but I kept getting backed up and they were taking my checks but they were not applying it to my taxes. So I talked and cried to the Community Tax representative named Latisha, about how so many people ripped me off and I just can’t trust anybody. She said, “We don’t do that here at Community Tax. We will help you and we will work with you.” That was Godsend. Latisha, George, Mary, all them, they are so helpful. They are awesome. They kept me on what was going on and very much on point. If I called them or left a message, they would call me back the following day. I was scared at first that these people are going to take my money but they didn’t do that. Community Tax has helped me out with everything and my issues have been resolved. The IRS stopped contacting me and sending me letters so I know it’s clear.
