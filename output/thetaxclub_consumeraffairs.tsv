The Tax Club took me for over 25,000.00$. They were to help me with the business. They also had their affiliates call me and offer their service and they don't do what they promise and when I call them I only got the answer machine and ask me to leave a message. I left them a message to call me as soon as possible to no avail. But I got A letter from the FTC that they took them to court and they got money from them.
I got involved with the Tax Club in 2010. I believed they were going to help me get my real estate venture (renovating houses to be group homes for people with developmental delays) up and running. I bought into the different services they offered because it all sounded good. I made a big mistake. Services were never delivered. $45,000 dollars later I finally stopped giving them any more money. I then tried to get my money back. That didn't work. I spent long hours talking to a Mr. **, who, when he actually returned my phone calls, told me that I signed contracts and that I can't ask for my money back. I filed all the reports with the Better Business Bureau and the Attorney General of New York. I then had to claim bankruptcy because I couldn't keep up with the minimum payments on my credit cards. I don't know which is the most bitter--losing all that money, or being taken for a fool.
I became a member in 2007 due to purchasing websites. I paid the tax club $1500.00 to setup a business account with them. I started out paying 29.95 a month and then it jumped to 39.95 a month. I'm just finding out they are being sued. I've tried to contact them to no avail. I just submitted my 2014 tax to their VTO tax refund site last week (3/16/2015). I don't know where I need to go from here to help resolve my situation. They are not answering their phones/or not in service any longer.
I paid approximately $1,500 for a lifetime membership in 2007. I paid $19.95 a month to keep the lifetime membership. In 2014 I was notified I had to pay $39.95 to keep my membership. That is breaking the contract that I had agreed to. I didn't know others disagreed with the rate increase until I saw this website. I think they should be required to pay us back the difference and honor the original contract.
I also paid an upfront fee of $1600.00 then.. was suppose to pay $19.95 for life & then this last year they decided to charge an annual fee as well as double my monthly fee to over $39.00 per month. They should honor those already in contract.
I joined in 2006. Paid over $1500 one time fee so I would only have to pay $19.95 per month for life. No other fees. All was fine until this year. They added a one time charge of $47.50 and raised the monthly rate to $39.95. That was not the deal.
Was looking to see if there were complaints about The Tax Club. I am a long time member, paid a huge one time lifetime fee for a $9.99 monthly fee for life. I recently received an email that my monthly fee was raised to $39.99 a month. I complained and asked how they justify not honoring their contract and raising my fee 300%. They stated they have the right to raise the fee to whatever they want. Is anybody getting anywhere with this? My attorney is sending them a complaint letter.
In 2010 they made me a C corporation and business plan. They promised to help me with my taxes and to return my investment in the e-store. Overall they took over $5000 dollars including over $1000 from me to file 2011 taxes but they still haven't finished it. Now they claim that I still owe over $600. Be careful when you deal with them.
Lifetime membership since 2004. For $9.95 per month business & personal income taxes done. They decided to raise fee to $39.95. I wanted them to prove that they had a right to increase. Complained to CR CD co they refunded & cancelled acct.
I have been a Tax Club member for 10 years. As the rest of the posting listed on June without warning, monthly fees quadrupled. Thinking it was a mistake, I contacted them asking them to correct the error. A very cut and dry answer implying take it or leave it, no explanation. Just that it was the new rate for old members. No consideration to the fact that I paid the highest join-in fee to get the $9.95 for life. A couple of years, I started getting a yearly surcharge for $39.95. I called but could not get it refunded. My problem now is that the manager of billing would not give any explanation or even listen to my concerns. What are the new terms of this change to my membership? How long will this new fees will be for? How often will the increases take place, etc... To add insult to injure, the so-called manager I have been dealing with has no manners to deal with customers. I am not expecting her to sugarcoat the increase but an explanation is not unreasonable to have, nor an answer to my questions. We are being imposed a significant fee increase without notice or choices on their change of terms. This is not the way to do business. This is not a dictatorship. If they are trying to get rid of the old customers, at least give us the choice to leave or accept higher fees. You cannot expect us to pay higher fees without even knowing for how long. Is there anything we can do as a group? Has anyone found anyone helpful in Customer Service?
Last month, after years of great service and paying only $9.95 a month due to a phenomenal one time start up fee, they raised my monthly fee to $39.95 a month instead of the $9.95 a month. I contacted them (at least 25 minutes of waiting) and was told that my original fee didn't have anything to do with not getting an increase in monthly payments when, in all reality, that is the exact reason I paid the one time fee: I wanted to pay only $9.95 a month. Otherwise I would have to pay more a month. I asked him if I was to be refunded the original amount since they broke the deal? His answer was no, and I should be satisfied because CPAs charge a lot more. It doesn't matter what they charge. I paid extra money in a lump sum so I could pay only $9.95 a month. If they are not going to honor that original deal, they should pay back the original lump sum of money. This month I was charged $39.95 again but it didn't end there. I was also charged the $9.95 on top of the $39.95 monthly charge. So, what will happen next month, a $200.00 dollar charge, $39.95 charge and $9.95? Who's to say that they can't raise it any time they want, contracts be damned! What happened to this company this year; did they suddenly get bought out by some sleazy online company and went for broke, deciding to take everyone for as much as they could get? I think everyone should complain to the Trade Commission. They might be able to get a fraction of the money back to us victims.
I have read the recent complaints about The Tax Club and I have had the same experience. My monthly fee went from $7.95/mos to $39.95/mos with no notice or reason whatsoever. I was told when I signed up in 2008 that the upfront money that I paid would allow me to only pay $7.95/mos for as long as I was a member. This is the first time that I have had a problem. I have tried for several days to reach The Tax Club by phone and have not been able to do so. A voice comes on and says all circuits are busy. The one time that I did get through I was on hold for over 30 min. and no one came on line to talk to me. I have even emailed them through the Tax Club site and no answer. Not sure who is running the company now, but I think it has turned into a crooked operation. It is time to CANCEL.
I like many others that have posted, got the hit of $39.95 per month after years of the lower rate due to paying a premium when I signed up. Now they are saying there is nothing in our agreement that states that they cannot raise my rate whenever the "market place" deems it a fair price. They told me I am free to "shop around" for a better price. I guess I took the bait hook, line and sinker when I signed up and was told the upfront premium would keep my monthly rate the same, but never made them provide me that statement in writing.
I came to this page to complain and found Rick's post below to be my exact experience, so I won't repeat everything he said. But I just found out today that my bank account was charged $39.95 instead of the regular $9.95. I called the Tax Club and was told they raised their rates effective this month. Thanks for the warning Tax Club! I find this to be an absurd amount to pay for what has become questionable in terms of their quality service. I would recommend people stay away because my experience is this isn't the same, reliable company I joined about 8-9 years ago.
I've been with The Tax Club for many years. When I joined, the rate was $1500 to join and then you pay $9.95 for as long as you remain a member. If you want additional services, like a nice cover for your return, you'd pay extra. Otherwise, you get the PDF download at no additional cost. The VTO has always been funky and buggy to use. However, it did improve over the years. It was a good service that did my business and my personal taxes each year. Then a few years ago, out of the blue, they started adding on a $38 a year "site" fee. I called to remind them that this was not part of the deal. They would waive the fee, but I had to call each year and ask again and again. Today, I am just plain angry. I got a letter from The Tax Club telling me that my monthly rate was going up from $9.95 to $39.95 a month! That's a 300% increase per month! This was NOT part of the original deal when I joined. Clearly this is a dishonest organization and they should be shut down for misleading people. There is no point in my demanding they stick to the original deal because now I know I do not want anything to do with these people! STAY CLEAR OF THE TAX CLUB!
I have been using The Tax Club to prepare our returns for the past 10 years or so. While I find their online system (VTO) that you need to fill out cumbersome and frustrating at times they have generally done a good job for us. This year I am ready to scream. I submitted my info over a month ago. Today is April 15th and we still do not have our returns for 2013. I assume we are going to receive a refund so will not have to pay a penalty, but the lack of communication and response from them has been horrific this year. Now they are costing me money (in terms of interest on our returns) and they are not even answering their phones. As I said in the subject line, if you have any other options, I would use them.
I signed up with a company that said I had to use The Tax Club. That company was a scam and shut down by the US Postal Inspectors. I informed TTC what happened and figured I should quit using them. They talked me in to doing Drop Ship since I spent so much money with them. They sounded convincing that DP would make money and they said they would build the website to run it. They needed more money of course. After a while, I asked about the website and they told me it would be ready in a few weeks. After several months of asking and no website, I asked again and they said they needed more money to make a better website. I said no and canceled. They gave me a hard time but finally gave up. In the meantime my credit cards were maxed out and no business to pay for them. I defaulted on the cards because I could not make payments. It took two years to get out of that mess which included lawyers and court time. Too many so called businesses out there stealing good people's money and ruining their lives including The Tax Club.
Attention, Texas victims of the Tax Club, et al. I was registered with the do-not-call (DNC) list of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), but was telemarketed anyway by first the Tax Club, selling its own incorporation and tax services, and then by Tax Club telemarketers selling bookkeeping, credit development, logo, business plan, and other purported services of other affiliates. Various promises made to me were untrue or unfulfilled. From what was said to me, I thought the Tax Club was the seller during the phone calls for the second and subsequent transactions, but then other documents--including billing transactions reflected on my credit card statements, agreements forwarded to me for approval after billing already had occurred, and the dispute communications with the credit card companies that ensued thereafter - referenced the other affiliates, not the Tax Club, as the sellers for those transactions. Billing dispute responses from the sellers reflected the same. I had no business relationship with the Tax Club prior to the telemarketing of its purported services, and I had no business relationship with any of the seller affiliates prior to the telemarketing of their purported services. The agreements I signed, and the cancellation deadline specifications given me, flunked content requirements of Texas law and flunked requirements that Texas law sets as prerequisites to the submission of a telemarketing billing to a credit card company or bank. I was also billed for things for which I never signed anything ever. Texas law on telemarketing, and related Texas law on deceptive trade practices, is strict. State laws are not trumped by, but rather co-exist with, federal law and FTC telemarketing regulations, according to the FTC itself when the FTC first proposed and adopted such regulations in the 1990's. A summary of my experience, and the specific misrepresentations, failures, and transgressions of the Tax Club and its seller affiliates, and the numerous illegalities we allege to have been committed by them, are the subject of a July 1, 2013, letter 8 pages in length, from my attorney to Tax Club counsel. Elaboration we have prepared fills 48 pages and 193 paragraphs, and contains specific chapter-and-verse citations to Texas law, federal law, and FTC regulations. We have pursued and are pursuing several angles towards obtaining redress. We are very interested in making contact with Texas complainants David, Monica, Stephen, and Jennifer, who have posted complaints against the Tax Club to this website in the past year, and making contact with other Texans who consider themselves Tax Club victims. Such complainants, for such contact purposes, may telephone **. You either will reach voice mail from me or will be able to talk in person to me or to my attorney’s assistant who is male. Please be ready to identify yourself by some verifiable means (such as first and last name, Texas address, and/or phone number), so that we can assure ourselves that you're a bona fide victim rather than just a snoop. I myself am a bona fide victim who has lost, like you and other complainants, a lot of money. Thanks.
On 11/10/2010 I was phoned by Dominic ** from Tax Club. At the time, I thought he was with Online Hosting Network, which had obtained $4,075.73. This was because all Americans sound the same on the phone to me. I told him I already had a company by way of above, but he told me I could get into Walmart and I could get back $10,000 from the tax dept by setting up the company. Very unpatriotic, I thought, by offering to a non-American. I stated I had lost my MasterCard, but he told me to give the number I thought it was. I even told him I had cancelled it and he told me I had not. I then tried to look for it and he told me not to hang up. With the thought of the previous mentioned online hosting, I thought I would lose more money. I eventually found it and gave him the number. He then told me forms would be sent to set up the business. After the phone call, I checked on the internet about Tax Club and found comments were not favorable. I was then unable to cancel the agreement, which they said I could within 3 days. I had $5,076 70 taken from my MasterCard account. When the papers arrived, I found out there was another $100 required to be paid. When I was phoned up a week later by a Jessica, I blew my top knowing I had been scammed. I told her, in abusive terms, that they had taken my money. I continued to get a bill for $28 per month to run the company. These stopped after 6 months. I have not received any refund and have not phoned back after the way Dominic spoke in an aggressive manner.
In the Oct 2010, one of Tax Club's telemarketers, Gary, called me on my cell phone. I have no idea how he obtained my number. He told me that he would set up an online business where I would make thousands of dollars per month. He charged me roughly $5000. In November, Gary phoned again wanting to charge me for marketing, he did so to the tune of $8000. Later on, in November, Chris and Tony of the Tax Club phoned me concerning accounting services that The Tax Club could provide. They charged me roughly $13,500. In late December, Mike of Online Essentials (The Tax Club) phoned me, regarding creating the website. Mike stated that he was working for Online Essentials and was based in Seattle Washington. He charged me roughly $16,500 for this fake business. In early January, Gary phoned me to charge roughly $8000 for other services that he said I needed for this so-called business. They always said that my money was safe and that I would earn a minimum of US$200,000 per year which is what other clients and also they, personally, were making this amount of money. I was promised an online business opportunity that would generate a lot of money. I have never earned one dime. I have been scammed. I was clearly taken advantage of and have been in deep agony and I am hurt, depressed that The Tax Club left me cold and hungry. I want all of my money back and my life as it was before The Tax Club came in and ruined my life. I am requesting a full refund of all of the money that The Tax Club has defrauded me. I have added up the credit card transactions that I have and I have called my credit card companies and the others are being sent to me. Thus far, I have added up over $42,000 with the statements that I have now. I just want my money back.
My experience with Success Planning Group (aka The Tax Club et. al.) has been remarkably similar to the ones I have been reading about here: numerous calls which convinced me to buy services that would allow me to establish an online business. Each call ( the salespeople all have different names) persuaded me that further services would be necessary in addition to the ones I had already purchased. The prices for these services were very steep, quite a bit more than what others were charged. There seems to be little consistency in the prices. In all, I have paid approximately $47.7k to this organization and do not have a viable business to show for it. It is true that I do have a website but it is completely invisible on the web as their SEO does not work. I paid $20k for it and it turned out that I was required to complete the SEO process myself. This proved extremely difficult using the tools they sent me and were almost impossible to use due to the lack of instructions. I would have thought that $20k would be more than enough money to get my website come up at the top of any Google search. When I complained about this, they asked for another $5k to complete the process for me! By then, I had realized that the money spent had been wasted and have filed complaints with the BBB and the FTC. (The BBB site reports that their operations have been shut down by the FTC while an investigation is conducted.) Unfortunately, I only recently discovered that Success Planning Group had an F rating from the BBB when I first agreed to engage their services. They did not disclose this to me when I could not find a listing for them and asked them about it. If I had known about the F rating, I would never have done business with them in a million years! My conclusion has to be that this is a fraudulent organization and the people involved are guilty of fraud and deserve to be given lengthy jail sentences.
They are also known as Success Planning, Success Online, Ikongo, All Access Books, Business Success Online, Business Credit, Resource Solutions, The Traffic Wizard and Online Solutions. I have had contact with Andrey, Stephen, Savannah, Vincent, Adam, Simonia, Toni, Dharti. My nightmare started in March 2012. My story is the same as all of the others, as far as all of the plans they said I needed. This cycle of calls just goes on and on. Every week, it's just another salesman selling you a new product; never any real coaching. Then, the next call is for website Trust Shield and a merchant account. Then, comes the website cost, initially $4,000.00, and then when I said I couldn't afford that, it was miraculously discounted to $1,997.00. Next was website design and business cards by iKongo (cost $895.00), and Small Business Credit. Finally, the last call was for the website marketing plan, and I didn't even have a website setup yet! The cost was $4,000.00! I was contacted by The Tax Club after purchasing a mentoring course from another company. I was caught in a web of deception that escalated to financial distress every step of the way. Finally, it was my gut that told me to stop listening and call a halt to everything. By then, however, I was nearing insolvency in a financial life becoming chaotic. Lack of continuity from one step to the next of this business building process and supposed coaching from the success team - I had a different coach almost every week. This lack of continuity was bewildering and affected my decisions. These men took the freedom to ask for more money and I was subjected to the high-pressure sales. At the same time, a coach might sound concerned and would encourage me to keep going as everything would turn out great. And as others have said, I did finally clue in that I really did not need an LLC and I too had been promised huge tax savings even though I had no income as yet. This business building was unnecessary because I did not know what I wanted to put into my primary business. Well, by the end of September I knew then I was not going to get any help as I was promised or they would hold my hand through the start of my website so I cancelled everything as I had lost a lot of money and was devastated. I had many sleepless nights not knowing what I was going to do. I knew I needed to get a job to start paying off these debts. It is truly disheartening what they do.
They are also known as Success Planning, Success Online, Ikongo, All Access Books, Business Success Online, Business Credit, and Online Solutions. I have had contact with Ryan, Joe, Lee, Wes, Michael, James, and Kevin. My nightmare started on 11-7-12. My story is the same as all of the others, as far as all of the plans they said I needed. My husband is dying from cancer. I signed up with Avenue 5 as a consultant to help me learn about starting a website. Next thing I know, I am contacted from The Tax Club, leading me to believe you are part of Avenue 5. I am persuaded into believing that I needed all of these different programs to succeed with my quest, only to be swindled out of around $24,000.00. I have not received anything from some of the programs this company advised. When I try to contact them, I get undelivered e-mail. I e-mailed in request to cancel certain items and even sent in registered mail with the same request. Boy was I contacted quick then, only to persuade me to not cancel by promising me a cheaper price and the additions of certain upgrades if I did not cancel. Needless to say, I did not receive any kind of a refund nor have I been able to reach anyone about the upgrades I was to receive. My quest was to make additional income so I could possibly go part-time and be able to spend time with my husband before he died, while at the same time make additional funds to help pay for the thousands of dollars we are in debt from the chemo. All this company did was max out my credit cards, which I can't even use now to help keep the bill collectors off my back. If my husband knew, it would literally kill him. He is so stressed out now from the amount of debt he feels he will be leaving me with when he dies. I myself cannot sleep or eat, knowing that I have been so stupid in allowing this company to take such advantage of me in my goal to just want to be able to spend more time with my husband. Instead, now I am working more overtime to make the payments on the credit card bills that I have nothing to show for. I will do everything I can to file any kind of a lawsuit against this company. I want a refund. In numerous responses on the Federal Trade Commission website, this company responded by saying, “Contact us and we will work something out.” Well, I have had e-mail contact with Jessica **, and she was to call me yesterday, and she did not. I e-mailed her and asked her to call me this morning, which she has not. So here is your chance. I am reaching out to you as you said in your many responses to complaints filed against you.
After I had received an email about a week ago saying that they were changing their name to something else, I looked up and scratched my head. I knew something felt weird about this whole thing. I'm $40 grand down. I haven't gotten my website from them that they said they were working on with me. While I've been waiting for them to finish the last 3 months, I decided to finish it all by myself instead. It puts tears in my eyes reading other posts of the same complaints. No money, no delivery, no website, no help either. I just don't get how people can be so ** up and put so many people's lives in debt. Karma will have its play with these crooks. Eye for an eye. You play with fire, you will get burned! May God have no mercy on your souls. I pray for everyone that got scammed from these people that money with prosper.
My experience with The Tax Club was much like the many reviews I just read! High pressure gorilla tactics disarmed me as I believed they had my best interest at heart with the smooth talk and an impressive address. My tax returns had the wrong Social Security number! Calls then came from Ikongo and Chuck ** at Success Internet. More dollars are invested in the American dream, thousands when I decided to cut bait. Hang up when they ask for your credit card number and tell you the call is recorded. They are all scammers!
I am an Affiliate Marketer with Amazon.com. They sold me a program - thetrafficwizard.com (bronze) - that cost $2497 to send traffic to my site. I got a call telling me I had to upgrade to the Gold and I would have lots of traffic to my site. That cost $2750. This site has a dashboard, members area, no graphs. It's a fake site! Check this out!
I relate to what you're saying. I, unfortunately, did buy into all the BS Anthony Morrison was spouting off. I was instructed that when I attended the workshop that I would be given the tools and information to have a successful business. I paid the initial fee of $4,500, which was hard to come by as it is as a single mother. However, I had a feeling of "Okay, now I'm on my way." I think I even started to hum the theme song from The Jefferson's Moving on up. Shortly after that initial fee, I started to get bombarded with calls from them wanting more and more money. They were saying I needed money for all these services in order for me to have a successful business, everything from web development to payroll to bookkeeping. I did not need many of these services as it's just me. However, again, I paid the money. After each time, a different company name was on my credit card statement. Never the same one twice. Why did they charge me under different names? A legitimate company, one that provides the services that it claims to, charges under the same name. For all I know, Billy ** in Tumbleweed, Arkansas is getting my money. I've called them on numerous occasions and every time getting a different answer. I have been told that Anthony Morrison or Adrian ** would contact me and I have yet to hear from him. I'm starting to think they don't even exist. Who does business like this? You're very fortunate on having not fell into Anthony Morrison's trap. I wish I would've never done it. I mean $17,400 later, I am now on food stamps, facing a potential bankruptcy, and God knows what else all because I trusted these people and they didn't hold true to their word. Online Strategies, whatever they want to call themselves, hasn't done anything but take food from my children's mouths. I can't feed them with empty promises! The worst business decision I have ever made was to get into bed with these crooks. I was struggling then and now I'm worse! I've had to change my number several times because creditors keep calling for money and thanks to PMI, I can't pay them! I thought the feeling of being ripped off from Anthony Morrison was bad. Try having to send your children to school with clothes too small because you did not have the money to buy them new school clothes or the pressure of making a little bit of money I get from food stamps stretch all month so my kids don't go hungry. This is no way to live. I mean I wanted to start a business so I would not have the worries and stressors of making ends meet. I had to contact an attorney on the steps that I needed to take in order to get my money reimbursed and he referred me to another law firm that better deals with companies like PMI, whose sole purpose seems to be to bankrupt unsuspecting people like myself. I spoke with Richard at **. He was really helpful and considerate of my situation, which is a lot more than I received from the consultants at PMI. I did not have to pay anything upfront like PMI or Online Strategies, which gave me peace of mind. I could not afford to get ripped off again. I was required to follow up with him a lot more than I had hoped for but all and all, it has been a success. I got my money and I'm just going to do the steps of opening my business the best way and that's without Anthony's help or the help of PMIwhoops!, Online Strategies, or whatever they want to call themselves. I'm just going to stick to calling them scam artists! So, to sum up everything, savings gone, business failed, bankruptcy almost, Government Assistance (yup), feeling like you can't provide for your children (check), all thanks to the one and only Anthony and this outfit that he's running. After speaking to Richard, I got something a lot more valuable than I thought I would - satisfaction! Getting my money back and sticking it to Anthony, priceless!
Our series of experiences with The Tax Club has been the most extreme of our life as we were caught in a web of deception that escalated to financial distress every step of the way. Finally, it was our gut that told me to stop listening and call a halt to everything. By then, however, we were nearing insolvency in a financial life becoming chaotic. Here is a list of the suspicious business practices we encountered: Lack of transparency from start to finish: There was no upfront information at the first step about what the total cost would be. I mistakenly assumed that the first output of money was all that would be asked, but each step of the way it would take more money to complete that step and on and on it went. It felt that if I had known the total costs, I would never have started in the first place. But then, I also felt like I was too far in to stop and I was still hoping we would reach a point where I would see income. Lack of continuity from one step to the next of this business building process and supposed coaching from the success team: I had a different coach almost every week. This lack of continuity was bewildering and affected my decisions. These men took the freedom to ask for more money and we were subjected to the high pressure sales I call guerrilla sales. At the same time, a coach might sound concerned and would encourage me to keep going as everything would turn out great. And as others have said, we did finally clue in that we really did not need an LLC and we too had been promised huge tax savings even though we had no income as yet. This business building was unnecessary because we did not know what we wanted to put into the LLC as my primary business. The vague and generic business plan alone cost upwards of $2,000. Obfuscation about who they were and who they were associated with: We thought the success building team was part of a primary opportunity we was pushing and they never indicated they weren't. Each time we would mention that we didn't want to go further until we received pending commissions from that business. Still, they would pressure me to keep going. We exasperatedly held to the belief that that business would come through and we went there and asked if The Tax Club was part of their business and they said absolutely not and they had never heard of them. Today, in consulting a consumer advocate, we have learned that very likely we will not get a penny from that business either and that they and The Tax Club could be affiliated for the purposes of sharing a percentage of the payments we were giving The Tax Club. So, they could be associated in a hidden way and not upfront at all. This could constitute a double scam and then one is faced with wondering if in turning for help somewhere perhaps that help might constitute a 3rd level of scam. Invasion of personal privacy and insensitivity to one's financial context in personal life and finances: We witnessed and experienced an alarming Mack Truck customer approach to the point of some coaches contacting credit card agencies themselves and asking them if they were willing to lift my credit limits or else go over the limit temporarily. This was the worst experience of all and it was at this point that we knew we had given over my personal decision making. Although we had consented to start with, we were unprepared for the lengths these coaches would go to get the money while completely ignoring my reservations and protests about doing this. The persuasion tactic at this ultimate point was that we were almost there and now my personal credit could be separated from business credit building. This again cost more money and we worked out a down payment, even though I was protesting that we had reached our limits. We did set this up and when we learned what my monthly fees would be for the next two years, I stopped everything. Yes, unfortunately, we had signed several contracts from one step to another but we are reporting this now and we fully intend to ask for reimbursement of everything we gave to The Tax Club. In trying to retrace our steps, we asked billing to send me an account for everything but we don't believe that all is reported there because there have been different billings under different names. We have to go through all our credit card statements since the last few months of this misadventure and try to find what we are sure is missing from the accounting because some parts of the business building team's work was outsourced somewhere else. Lastly, this misadventure with financial bullies constitutes elder abuse. I am retired and had hoped some investment in recurring income could improve our life (my wife and I) and the lives of others I care about as I proceed into older age. Instead, we surrendered the remainder of our savings (approximately, $40,000) from our false hopes and gave our independence to the pressures of questionable salespeople. They held out false promises, exacted exorbitant fees for no returns, and exemplified heedlessness about the financial rights of their customers. It feels like robbery and certainly like a setup, full of false promises leading to dispossession of many of the persons involved with them. I think the Tax Club needs to be investigated. It’s sad to see that this company has bullied and taken so many innocent people for so much money. Partial refunds are really not an option. Contracts have been signed but services were never delivered as promised.
I was called by the Success Planning Group and was offered all sorts of services I was told I needed to get my business going. I was sold numerous services and products, which I am discovering are either not needed or not providing services offered. I make calls and am lucky to be contacted to try to resolve my issues. I was bullied into purchasing all types of services that are not providing any help or service and found no help from them. I have since started the charge back process through the credit card companies to try to get a refund because I'm not getting services or help I was told I would receive. Their tactics are high pressure and misleading and vague, and I find it deplorable the way they operate and treat people just trying to make a living. I can understand why this once great country, for which I served years ago, is in the shape it's in because these companies are allowed to prey upon others and bilk them out of their money so easily. I would like any kind of help that I can get right now as I try to contain the damage started to my once great credit history in hopes to avoid having to file bankruptcy and further damaging my credit score.
I was contacted by Horizon Learning (an affiliated company of the Tax Club) and was talked into creating an online business. This Horizon Learning company gave my information to Tax Club for them to help me legalize my business and help with my tax filling. After I paid almost $5,000 to Tax Club, $3,500 to Horizon and another $5,000 to other affiliate companies (Small Business Credit and Traffic Wizard), I haven't seen any work done by their part nor a call to give me updates nor anything. The only thing that they are good to do is to withdraw monthly payments from my accounts besides of all the money they made me pay upfront. I just had to close and cancel accounts to stop these withdraws. I lost about $15,000 between November 2011 and May 2012. I can't believe there are people out there that are heartless in taking life savings from people.
I was offered by a tax agent of the Tax Club who initially said it would cost $8207 to set up. I protested and after an hour on the phone, they got their way saying that I had to have their services or I could not operate in the US. A week later, they contacted me again demanding that I pay them another $8000 for additional services that I had to have to trade. This time I said no as they said last time that is all I had to pay and there would be no further charges. They immediately said that I could pay about $4000. But I refused and told them that I would opt out and take the 85% that they said I could have refunded if I returned the Refund Authorization forms within 15 working days of the initial transaction - of which I have done two forms of four transactions. Only one form for transactions has been paid. The total owing is $3652.45. They do not respond to fax, email or telephone messages. Please help.
I am an enrolled agent with over 20 years of experience in tax preparation and taxpayer representation. I recently prepared the tax returns of an 85-year-old woman who has been scammed out of over $56,000, over 2010 and 2011. The woman, who lives in senior housing across from my office in upstate NY, lives on social security and a small pension, and lost virtually her entire life savings to this major con. She apparently enrolled in The Tax Club, not knowing what she was getting into and only looking for help in preparing her tax return. She saw thousands of dollars being charged on her credit card and taken from her bank account, not knowing what they were for, and she was unable to receive any answers when she called for help. The theft only stopped when she closed the charge card and bank account last year. She is not, shall we say, up to the mental challenge in dealing with this, although she has reported this to the NY and Florida state AG's offices. She informs me that The Tax Club is now under investigation in Florida. In my practice, I have often seen clients who had been swindled by unscrupulous investment advisors, ripped off by phony investment and business schemes, and had their identity stolen. In all my years, I have never seen anything as sad, pathetic, and infuriating as what Tax Club did to this woman.
This all started on February 23, 2012, and I terminated services on March 28 2012 - that’s only 34 days. Now, when the Tax Club is getting money from you, everything is peaches and cream; however, when the money stops flowing all of a sudden, they don’t want to talk to you anymore; and heaven forbid, you do the unthinkable and cancel! That's what I tried to do. Then, I get the call from Christi in the cancelation department. She proceeded to leave me a message, in a condescending tone, that my requests have been received. When I returned her call, I asked when I would be getting my refund, and I was past the 15-day deadline to receive a refund minus 15%. I listened in amazement as Christi told me, in the same condescending tone, that I would not get a refund on most of the products because they had performed services for me! My response was “What services? My account has only been active for 34 days!” My involvement with the Tax Club began after I signed up with Meridian Consulting Online. Within the same day of signing up with Meridian, I was contacted by the Tax Club. There was no verbal or written disclosure from Meridian that my contact and credit card information would be given to the Tax Club. I'm certain there is a privacy law broken here. The next thing I know, the Tax Club is calling and telling me that, for me to be successful, I need to purchase their products. I can honestly say I have never dealt with a more unethical company in my life. No one at the Tax Club knows the meaning of the words “total disclosure”. I feel that this company takes advantage of first-time business owners and rips them off big time! The environment at the Tax Club is one of high-pressure sales and deception. They specialize in selling you products that are way overpriced and that you don't need. These guys already have your financial information, credit card numbers, etc., that you used in a previous transaction. In fact, the first thing they ask you is “How is your credit? Is it good or bad?” Even if you tell them you don’t think you have enough room on a card for the transaction, the usual response is “Let’s just see if it will go through,” and zing, they run your card. It is obvious that, since they already have your credit card numbers, they are all setup in there computer and the transaction is ready to run before they even call you! Very high-pressure sales and no one there is really interested in helping you; they just want to get to the credit card! I was also told I could call at any time and ask the coaching staff questions; this turned out to be a lie as well. Every time I called, I was told I couldn’t speak with a member of the staff because it was not my scheduled appointment day. Also, the Tax Club only operates on their schedule and has no regard for anyone else. Of course, the Tax Club is based in New York, Eastern Time. If you ask them to call you at a certain time, there is, after all, a 3-hour difference between New York and California, to make it easier for you to take the call; they persist in calling when it is convenient for them, without any concern for you. Then, it’s time for my first coaching call. This time it is Allen ** on the call. I did not know it at the time, but Allen was not a coach, he is a salesman! In fact, I never got to speak with a program coach; all I ever spoke to was the sales staff. Allen then proceeded to start telling me I would definitely need full service bookkeeping services provided by All Access Books, and Small Business Credit. The services advertised were credit card statements, bank statements, cash receipts (if applicable), balance & loss, access to All Access Books website, bookkeeping once a month, quarterly filing of sales tax, corporate branding (by iKongo), and yearly corporate tax return filing - total cost $8,585.00, with $90.00 recurring charge every 90 days. This is all included for the life of the company, of course. This cycle of calls just goes on and on. Every week, it’s just another salesman selling you a new product; never any real coaching. Then, the next call is for website Trust Shield and a merchant account. Then, comes the website cost, initially $4,000.00, and then when I said I couldn’t afford that, it was miraculously discounted to $1,997.00. Next was website design and business cards by iKongo (cost $895.00), and Small Business Credit. Finally, the last call was for the website marketing plan, and I didn’t even have a website setup yet! The cost was $4,000.00! That’s when I pulled the plug. Grand Total they got from me is $17,861.00! They didn’t even do a tax return for me! I had not incorporated yet, and there were no expenses to enter in bookkeeping either. Over the course of 34 days, all the Tax Club did was take money from me, and all I received in the process was grief, high-pressure sales tactics, and a condescending attitude. I will not allow this to happen. I’m planning on taking further action to make sure I get my money back.
I was told after watching a television infomercial that I was guaranteed a refund if I bought a program to start a business. They then told me I had to add all these other charges and services in order for a new business to be successful. I told them I would wait on The Tax Club since I haven't even started the business. Again, I was told on phone I had to pay for their services to get my business name and tax ID number. They again told me it's a no-risk and if I wasn't successful after one year, my money would be refunded. When one year was almost up and the new business techniques did not work at all, I called for my refund and was refused. I spent $1,000 for nothing! Major credit card fraud! I am still paying on my credit cards and now have paid over two years of interest and was never able to start a business and only obtained credit card debt!
The Tax Club contacted us offering different products and services for our business. With this, everything was said to be tax deductible and that we would get it all back. With all these different products we have nothing to show for it. We have invested in over $20,000, and when you have a family of seven to support, it is a lot of money. They have drained my husband and I dry. Between bills and now credit card bills, they have put my family in a very difficult situation. Especially when they promised all their products would help us and that we needed them for our business. Don't forget they promised we would get it back when we filed taxes. They are nothing but a rip off and will take you for everything you have.
I met a friend of mine in a bar and he told me he is making $100K a year. I inquired about working at his new job, The Tax Club. I applied and went to the Empire State Building for an interview. I thought it was very interesting. These salesmen talk on the phone and stand there, looking out the window to an awesome view of the city. Then, I got to listen on the phone. They get leads from some business coaching seminar that stupid people went to. One sale went through, only to be turned down by the credit card company. They record their conversation when they confirm an order, so you can't get refunded the money. They were rude to my job references. It's really a credit card fraud.
I was contacted by The Tax Club after purchasing a mentoring course from another company. On the first occasion, I was told that to succeed online I must register with the USA IRS. Their package would arrange this for me and entitle me to one IRS tax return completed by them. The cost for these services was to be US $3,890. The call continued for some time until I agreed to purchase the package. Thereafter, appointments were made on a regular basis. Without The Tax Club being specific, I was left with the impression that these calls related to services I had already purchased from the club. In fact, a number of these turned out to be sales calls for more "must have to succeed" online services. These calls were very high pressure. They all lasted for a considerable length of time until I agreed to purchase their latest package. I understand that high-pressure sales tactics are not permitted in USA. For the last two packages, I made it very clear that I could not afford those packages. The Tax Club advised me they would arrange loans to complete the purchase prices. Details of these loans were not provided. The high-pressure sales tactics put me at a severe disadvantage. By continuing the conversations on until I agreed to make the various purchases, I was denied the opportunity to check for similar packages online. In every case, I would have located packages offering similar services at far cheaper prices. Indeed, if I had done a simple "the tax club + scam" Google search before making the initial purchase, I would never have made it. I was amazed at how many complaints there are online against the company. These tactics also disadvantaged me in other ways. Both their website and all of the sales conversations promised professional services. This has been far from the truth. One of their packages, The Traffic Wizard, promised me 1157 targeted hits a week for 52 weeks. In fact, after more than 26 weeks, it is still to deliver one hit to my site. The service in respect of all of the packages purchased has been unprofessional in some way. In two of the other four packages purchased, it has been amazing how unprofessional it has been. Promises not kept. A number of promises made by The Tax Club have not been kept. Emails have not been replied to. Once again, this amounts to misrepresentation of their professional services. More importantly at the end of each sales call, I was promised agreements for signature setting out the terms of the purchase. For the first three purchases, the agreements were not received until nearly six months after the sale. Even then, this was only after I asked for them that they arrived. This disadvantaged me in that it left me unaware as to my rights were and what I had purchased. Also, I understand that it is illegal by USA law. I was advised that I would be forwarded an agreement in respect of the two loans arranged. I did receive one. However, I am yet to receive the second one.
I responded to a suggestion from a friend for an online business. I initiated the contact for information. The initial set up for income advantages coaching was U$D3,850. This was information as an eBay reseller. I am a senior confined to a wheel chair. I only was looking to make enough money to have my van converted to live with my disability. I told this to the coach and he assured me that with this investment, I would soon be making thousands in the new business venture. I should have looked into this company, but I so wanted to believe that I went along. There was never any clear reference to what exactly I would be reselling on eBay only that there were thousands to be made. When I started to question, I was told that to sell on eBay people were looking for bargains. An educator called and said that to really make money, I needed to get into drop shipping. In order to get set up as a dropshipper, they would require more money, and more to set up a business credit. Every time I questioned, I received another call with more hard-sell tactics. I am a senior and I did not understand that there are people that will employ these types of practices to scam people out of money. Again, all I really wanted was something worthwhile to occupy my time so that I could afford to live comfortably with my disability. I am confined to a wheelchair and I am vulnerable. These people know just how to handle such a situation. They played on my vulnerability to extract what limited money I have. My quality of life has been compromised because of my willingness to believe. I am at a loss. I just don't know what to do next.
I purchased an online website where I was an affiliate marketer for Amazon, Clickbank, etc. in January 2012 from a company in the U.S. During the first week in February 2012, all of the calls started. First was a gentleman from The Tax Club who said he received my information from another party/company about a business venture I had just started. They were selling a business saver plus package; the price was $4,785.00 with a monthly recurring charge of $49.95. At this time, I told them that my business wasn't even up and running yet and I was told that in order to qualify for my business start-up costs, I would need this service. The next call came the following week. This was for business credit coach (one-on-one coaching), setup of credit bureau files (not done), access to members only back office (?), access to business credit specialists who apply for business credit funding (not done), help to get DUN's number (not done), access to business credit lender list of over 2,000 companies (not done), access to their network of over 378 banks and business lenders, personally introduce and recommend me for funding (not done). After a lot of going back and forth with this gentleman, I felt I had no choice but to purchase this package in the amount of $4,995.00. Otherwise, my business would fail. The next call came the same day and was from All Access Books for bookkeeping services costing $2,995.000, with a quarterly recurring charge of $99.00. Again, I was made to feel this was required for the success of my business. The following week, it was Essential Plans calling for the purchase of the business plan silver package for $2,693.00, which was to include a business plan strategy, provision of DUNs (not done), lifetime proofing and editing of business plan, provision of corporate credit cards, referrals to 3rd party lenders and drop shippers (not done) and unlimited one-on-one consultations. This has not been done even though I had made attempts to reach someone. My calls were not returned. The same day, I also received a call from a gentleman from Success Online for the purchase of the Traffic Wizard Gold package for $5,000.00. This was to include linking thousands of related domain names to my website, send 10,000 visitors to my site every month. Again, under extreme pressure to have a successful business, I purchased this package. I have had several phone conversations regarding the visitors they are supposedly sending to my site which I don't see, but they assured me that this is being done. By this time, I have used up all my personal credit, I am over the limit on one credit card and have maxed out my personal line of credit. The following week, a call came from a gentleman for more purchases that my business would require to be successful. I told him I had no more credit available and with much talk back and forth, he talked me into getting another credit card which I was able to do and I purchased a business logo from Ikongo, which included designing a logo for my business and 1000 business cards for the sum of $1,925.00. This is the only thing I purchased without delays for what was provided. I also purchased a Merchant V-Card Bronze package from Success Online for $399.00, which is a virtual business card to be used on places like Facebook, Twitter, etc. I got nothing but the runaround with this and I have not received this. Lastly was the purchase of the Consumer Trust Platinum package from Success Online for the sum of $2,295.00. These last 3 purchases put me over my limit on my new credit card, but this was approved after the gentleman from Success Online called my credit card provider first. At this point, I felt that all my decision-making had been taken out of my hands and these people had taken over. I was pressured very strongly by them saying things like "Don't you want your business to succeed?", "We see you haven't made any money yet and these purchases will ensure the success of your business." I told them I was so far in debt now that I could not even pay what I owed now, my personal credit was suffering. They said that I would have to decide whether I wanted to succeed or not and again, I purchased things I didn't feel I needed. In late April, I started receiving calls from a gentleman trying to sell me more marketing. He got my information from The Tax Club to call me because my business wasn't doing well. I told him I had no more money to invest, that I was already in debt for $33,000.00. This guy practically harassed me over the next few weeks. No more calls until late June 2012, when a gentleman named Rick called from Online Business Solutions (I believe this is what he said). He told me he was given my information from The Tax Club and he wanted me to purchase a marketing package for my business for the sum of $3,995.00. I told him no, I had no more money to invest. The following week, he called again and when I said to him that he had called me the previous week, he said it wasn't him but I said the guy had the same name and was calling from the same place. Again, he said it wasn't him and that if I couldn't pay $3,995.00 for this package, maybe they could give it to me for $1,995.00. I told him it didn't matter how much it costs, that I didn't have the money. He then went on to say "Can't you set aside $5.00 a week to make this business a success?" and I said no. At this time, I could invest nothing more. He told me he would call again in a few weeks, but I told him it would make no difference, there would be no change. I was broke, I was paying for purchases already that I either didn't receive or didn't require for my business and that my personal credit had been damaged because of all this. These guys don't care about the average person. They only care about making money themselves. They are salesmen who are only interested in making a buck and use every line they can think of to reel you in deeper and deeper. I am nearing retirement, but now because of bad advice from these guys, I will not be retiring for years and years to come. Lastly, I would add that all these dollar amounts are in U.S. funds and I am Canadian and had to pay the exchange rate so in fact, paid more than what you see here. I feel very strongly that I should be reimbursed for a lot of these purchases because of the tactics used. I don't need a lot of these things and had I spoke with an expert first, I would not have done this. Thank you for listening and I hope to hear from you soon.
I started my new online business last year. The Tax Club came in and introduced all kinds of services that could help my website making money in the long run. I paid almost $50,000.00 for them and trusted them that I would get my money back within a year. The salesman advertised lots of story, which made me fall into the dark hole and I didn't notice. I just want to keep my family under the roof, but I couldn’t make any money since April of 2011. I couldn't keep up with the recurring charge every month, so I have to cancel the services two months ago. The only services I got from The Tax Club were headache and bad credits. I don't have any money left and I couldn't buy anything for my kids, such as new summer clothes, toys, and I can’t take them to the movies. I have to save all the money so I can pay the creditors. I have to spend all my kids’ savings for these services that I couldn't get anything from them. They refuse giving me back for the services that were never rendered. I don't know what to do next. I just have to work and suffer for the mistake that I listened to The Tax Club.
I would like to submit a formal complaint against The Tax Club's lack of service. I have been given various "business names" including ** and **. I secured their services at the end of March to create a website for a small company in West Texas. The website has been through a series of "revisions." Each time, I refused to accept the site because the changes that I requested were not completed. When I have responded to their design, I have had to call back 1 to 2 weeks later and ask why the changes haven't been completed. I will then receive a new request to accept with maybe 1 or 2 of the changes that I requested having been made. Case in point, the second time we went over the site, I requested a total of 5 changes from changing colors to adding the logo and changing some pictures. After two weeks, I contacted them five times over three days and finally received a call back. Within two hours, I received a new copy of my entry page with just the logo added - none of the other changes were addressed. I called again and resubmitted my request for change. I waited a month for an updated page, and finally called to cancel the service and receive a refund. I was told that there were services rendered, so I wasn't entitled to a refund. When they realized that I had copies of all of our correspondence, they offered a 25% refund which is still unacceptable. I signed up to received a full working website. After 3-1/2 months of going back and forth, I still haven't received even the first page according to the specifications that I have given to the company repeatedly. As I told the representative, I work in the oilfield. I can work on a pump all that I want, and if I don't give the customer a working pump, I don't get any money. That is the way business works. These services that they supposedly rendered were grossly inferior and completely unacceptable.
My series of experiences with The Tax Club has been the most extreme of my life as I was caught in a web of deception that escalated to financial distress every step of the way. Finally, it was my gut that told me to stop listening and call a halt to everything. By then, however, I was nearing insolvency in a financial life becoming chaotic. Here is a list of the suspicious business practices I encountered: Lack of transparency from start to finish. - There was no upfront information at the first step about what the total cost would be. I mistakenly assumed that first output of money was all that would be asked but each step of the way, it would take more money to complete that step and on and on it went. It felt if I had known the total costs, I would never have started in the first place. But then, I also felt like I was too far in to stop and I was still hoping we would reach a point where I would see income. Lack of continuity from one step to the next of this business building process and supposed coaching from the success team. - I had a different coach almost every week. This lack of continuity was bewildering and affected my decisions. These men took the freedom to ask for more money and I was subjected to the high pressure sales I call guerrilla sales. At the same time, a coach might sound concerned and would encourage me to keep going as everything would turn out great. And as others have said, I did finally clue in that I really did not need an LLC and I too had been promised huge tax savings even though I had no income as yet. This business building was unnecessary because I did not know what I wanted to put into the LLC as my primary business. The vague and generic business plan alone cost upwards of $2,000. And I had already established the LLC with another outfit. Obfuscation about who they were and who they were associated with. - I thought the success building team was part of a primary opportunity I was pushing and they never indicated they weren't. Each time, I would mention that I didn't want to go further until I received pending commissions from that business. Still, they would pressure me to keep going. I exasperatedly held to the belief that that business would come through and I went there and asked if The Tax Club was part of their business and they said absolutely not and they had never heard of them. Today in consulting a consumer advocate, I have learned that very likely I will not get a penny from that business either and that they and The Tax Club could be affiliated for the purposes of sharing a percentage of the payments I was giving The Tax Club. So they could be associated in a hidden way and not upfront at all. This could constitute a double scam and then one is faced with wondering if in turning for help somewhere perhaps that help might constitute a 3rd level of scam. Invasion of personal privacy and insensitivity to one's financial context in personal life and finances. - I witnessed and experienced an alarming mac truck customer approach to the point of some coaches contacting credit card agencies themselves and asking them if they were willing to lift my credit limits or else go over limit temporarily. This was the worst experience of all and it was at this point that I knew I had given over my personal decision making. Although I had consented to start with, I was unprepared for the lengths these coaches would go to get the money while completely ignoring my reservations and protests about doing this. The persuasion tactic at this ultimate point was that we were almost there and now my personal credit could be separated from business credit building. This again cost more money and we worked out a down payment even though I was protesting that I had reached my limits. I did set this up and when I learned what my monthly fees would be for the next two years, I stopped everything. Yes, unfortunately, I had signed several contracts from one step to another but I am reporting this now and I fully intend to ask for reimbursement of everything I gave to The Tax Club. In trying to retrace my steps, I asked billing to send me an account for everything but I don't believe that all is reported there because there have been different billings under different names. I have to go through all my credit card statements since the last few months of this misadventure and try to find what I am sure is missing from the accounting because some parts part of the business building team's work was outsourced somewhere else. Lastly, this misadventure with financial bullies constitutes elder abuse. I am retired and had hoped some investment in recurring income could improve my life and the lives of others I care about as I proceed into older age. Instead, I surrendered the remainder of my savings from my false hopes and gave my independence to the pressures of questionable salespeople. They held out false promises, exacted exorbitant fees for no returns, and exemplified heedlessness about the financial rights of their customers. It feels like robbery and certainly like a set up full of false promises leading to dispossession of many of the persons involved with them.
In October 2011, I received a call from a Jacques ** from The Tax Club. He said they were working with PMI (not true) and they had been asked to contact us (my wife and I) to help us set up our business. He offered us a business saver plus program which included the setup of an S-corp, issuance of EIN, unlimited tax consulting, e-tax hotline, customized tax plan, and filling of personal and business taxes for 2011 ($895). The package would cost us $4,785. We told him we were not doing business yet, so there was no income. He insisted the S-corp would benefit us because we could write off what we had invested with PMI, the cost of starting the business, and that there was a total of 330 write-offs for the business. The S-corp was established in November 2011. Two weeks before the tax deadline (April), my wife completed an online application they called the VTO and followed up with a call. She was told by Mily ** that the taxes would not be filed on time and that we had to wait for an agent to be assigned to our file. When Kevin was assigned to the file, he told us we could not write off anything on the business because there was no income. My wife then contacted our longtime tax professional who informed her there was an $800 yearly tax for an S-corp, the deadline for the business tax was March 15, and that we could report a start-up cost on the business and the rest would be amortized over the next 15 years! We have called several times, but got the runaround. After reading comments on this website, I e-mailed them on May 22 to the address provided by them on this website (ca@thetaxclub.com) and another one given to us by one of their lousy customer service reps (clientcare@thetaxclub.com). I received an auto response that said I would get a response within 3-5 business days, but I have heard nothing. All these "professional" Tax Club representatives do is lie, lie, and lie to get our money. I will not stop until I get what they owe me. I know they cannot charge me for services not provided to me and they did not file my taxes and customize a tax plan. And whenever you call, you always have to leave a message for someone to call you back because there is nobody available to answer your questions right there and then.
I feel like I have been sold, in high pressure, products and services I clearly do not need. Their tax advice thus far is just my name applied to some standard explanation of tax practices which I can get for $150 from TurboTax, not $4,700. I just got off the internet and found free services such as obtaining an EIN. Big deal, it is just a form, no special training to obtain that. My naiveté in business matters made their salesmen sound sensible. In fact, they want you to pay and expensively for nothing but advice; you will do most of the work anyway. They want you to pay for services when you don't even have a business yet. Doing my business taxes and bookkeeping will be easy since I have no business yet and no transactions to keep track of. There are all sorts of free bookkeeping software and I have done my own taxes for the last 25 years with no audits and no problems. I just want my money back for services not done. I realized they filed for my EIN and corporate papers; again, both things offered for free on the internet. They are just standard forms, nothing more. If sometime in the future these things become too hard for me to deal with, then maybe it would make sense to hire them. Not without any business. They will just run up your credit and ruin your credit while continuously trying to sell you more services. Monies that could better be spent building your business. I want my money refunded. This all began by them sounding as if they were associated with Power Sellers College Tech, which they are not. So at first, I thought I was being advised by one of the instructors from PSCT. It just doesn't make sense to invest in all these services before you even have a business up and running. Sort of a cart before the horse scenario.
In January 2011, I purchased an entity and tax program for $1890 from The Tax Club after spending $5,000 on Stores Online and $20,000 with PMI. When I bought The Tax Club products, I was told by Mike **, the representative that once my company incurred a loss, which most companies would, I would recoup the full amount of $1890 in my taxes. I felt that Mike pressured me and convinced me that I would be making a lot of money and that I would need a resident IRS agent. I thought that this and the fact that I would be able to get all my money returned in 2011 would be a huge benefit. Turns out to all be lies. I would not have purchased this product if it were not for him telling me this. There was no question in my mind nor in his mind of what he was telling me. This money would be returned to me, period. Then come 2011. My plan was to use The Tax Club in 2012 for the 2011 year taxes and so I contacted The Tax Club and informed them in early February that I needed the forms sent to me in the mail and not in electronic form because I don't do anything on my email. They said that they would send it to me. After a couple of weeks, I called The Tax Club back asking about the forms. They said that they had sent the forms via email. I told them again that I needed the forms sent to me via mail. The representative said that they would send the forms via regular mail. Again, I never received the forms after a couple more weeks of waiting. I called again and spoke with a different representative who said that they would overnight the forms to me. I received the forms within 2 days of the tax deadline. The forms were a terrible quality as though they had been copied multiple times. And at this point, it's too late for me to complete the forms and send them back to The Tax Club because I would be in violation of the deadline set by the IRS. So I ended up going with H&R Block to complete my taxes for $400. After I filed my taxes with H&R Block, I was informed by them that the cost of this product, $1890, I had purchased from the Tax Club would not be returned to me as the salesman had said. You can imagine how furious I was at this point. All this hassle and money spent and I don't receive the money back as was promised. I feel like I was scammed! I then called Nicole with The Tax Club and explained what happened. She was very abrupt with me and didn't seem to care about everything I had gone through with The Tax Club. She then read me a sentence that said that I agreed that the representative did not make any earnings claims to me at the time of the agreement. I don't even know what an earnings claim was at the time I enrolled, so I don't know if he made these claims or not! There was so much information being told to me at the time. How am I supposed to realize that the representative telling me that I would have the full amount returned when my taxes are completed to be a lie or earnings claim? Tax Club needs to fix their sales! Now I'm broke and can't afford these monthly payments. Tax Club did not provide any service to me and brought me into their program with false hopes and misrepresentations. This is only the beginning of what I am prepared to do. I need someone to call me, not email me.
Website/Logo/Services in general - The salesman indicated in a roundabout manner that they were associated with a coaching service that I had recently signed up with and paid for, and he proceeded to tell me that I had to have all of these other services. Very high pressure and they kept calling me back until I relented. The amounts of money kept changing but in the end, I was out some $19,000 plus for services only partially delivered. They then wanted me to e-sign a bunch of so called receipts which read more like additional permissions for payment (the word receipt and descriptions of services conveniently omitted). I did not sign and asked for a refund of my money, I got no response to that, only another request to e-sign. I did not and have not heard from them since. I am disabled and used some of my retirement funds for this. If I do not get a refund of all or at least part of this money, I will soon be homeless. This was without a doubt all a scam. I cannot understand how these people got my name and phone number as they contacted me. There is a privacy leak somewhere. I thought this was illegal per company policy. I shall have to inquire with The Federal Trade Commission.
I was contacted by the Tax Club after Consumer Affairs published my complaint. The lady told me that she would look into my case and call me back within 48 hours, which she did. She told me that they had decided to refund me $3,500.00. I was happy to get something - anything at this point is good. I received three refund forms, one for success planning, one for my essential plans and one for Internet marketing. When I bought their services, I paid in U.S. money and I had to pay the exchange. They send me refund forms totaling $2,920.25 - that is just a slap in the face. Then they include a clause that says I will have to release the Tax Club, their associates and assigns of all further responsibilities and liabilities. Success Internet cost me a lot of money by dragging the completion of the "website" for almost a year. I paid for a site hosting company, signed a three-year contract for a merchant account, paid monthly payment for months. When it was obvious that they were not able, capable or competent enough to give me what I had paid for, I had to cancel the merchant account and pay three years of services I did not use, plus a cancellation fee of $300.00. The refund would have been so welcomed at this time but not at the expense of my ability to voice my opinion and experience with the company. I would have accepted the money, not $2,920.25, but the whole $3,500.00, had there been no condition to the refund. The Tax Club owes me this money (there is no doubt at all) but they should not ask that I give up my rights. They took everything from me and so did their associates. I want my money back, all the money that Success Internet charged me for services not rendered. How dare they cry out "wonderful new." They just used me again. No, it's not good new. It will be good new when they pay me back.
From the minute I answered the phone, I was lied to. I answered the phone, and could tell it was a telemarketer, so I said I wasn't interested. He said, "You just spent $10,000 with us and you're not interested." So I said, "Oh, it's you, guys." He said yes and to enhance and make my business work, I needed to get my taxes, quarterlys done, plus a business plan. This cost over $3000. They sent papers the same day, as to business plan, which I could have pulled up off the internet within 15 minutes like they did, but I opted for the cancel button instead of e-signing their papers, when I found out he lied. He wasn't even associated with the company I spent the $10,000.00 with, and all the cancellation would let me print was a note that said you have been successfully removed and I still kept getting phone calls from them wanting more money, for quarterly filings, business loan, etc., things which he told me were included in what I had already paid. What a liar, cheat, scam, everything I hate. I have e-mailed them, called asked to speak to owner, no success, and the bank won't refund money because they said they gave me some service. They sent me everything they did the same day, and they have a 3-day full refund. Ha! What a lie! Since I had to pay another $3,000 to someone else, Amerify, to do my taxes and quarterlys, which they have done. I want all my money back from them, the Tax Club, my essential plans, success planning group, whatever they want to call themselves. Also, I want the world to know what liars and cheats they are, so no one else has to go through what I have, help help! This is so wrong; they prey on older people on social security, mostly older people because we are old school and are honest, so we believe others are also. Bot anymore, and I don't like to feel like that, but I've been cheated and lied to so much. Stop these people now, make them refund the money they don't deserve and didn't work for, plus I think they should pay penalties.
I decided to get a website with Genesis Admin which is another story in late 2011. Not long after, I get a phone call from the Tax Club offering to help me get my business going with help to get an IRS number and getting an LLC name. All this sounded easy as I was told this was all able to be claimed back on my tax return. I thought about it and decided not to go ahead with it, but some guy rang and talked me round to thinking this would all be okay. This was a large outlay at the time, which went on my credit card. Not long after, I got another call from a different person selling me Asset protection etc., and again saying this was all tax-deductible. I am not sure how many things I was sold by many different people. This got very confusing as I didn't even know what they were supposed to be doing. They talked the talk and I stupidly gave my credit card number and 6 months later, I am 30000 New Zealand dollars down the toilet. At one stage, with my credit card at the max, they even got me a loan to pay off. What was I thinking? I was last contacted in January; they were trying to hard sell me marketing and then later trying to sell me compliance which I did not go through with. They were very intimidating phone calls. I have all the names of people I have talked to. I have not been contacted since, not a word. It's very hard to call from the other side of the world. I live in New Zealand time frames and zones, have tried many times and cannot get through. I emailed a few of these people, have not had any reply, very poor. I emailed The Tax Club a couple of times about tax returns. Someone called from the tax returns department and I was told that I could not do a tax return as I was not trading (my website is live but not making any money). This just sent me into depression as I was told that all the money I spent was tax deductible. I believe these people are scamming me with their sales talk. They knew I was an easy target, not from the USA, so they kept at me. They sent out electronic purchase receipts but I have never sent these back. I'm not sure about the law from down here about these. I have had no service from these guys. They don't help you and they sold me things that I will never ever need. I only have this little website which has not made any money and will probably never make any money. I am so upset with what they have done and with myself.
I was contacted by The Tax Club after filling a form for information about e-commerce. They told me they could help me set up an e-commerce business and that they offered all the help I could ever need including tax filing, website, virtual office, bookkeeping, etc. Their "associates" iKongo, success internet, accountants etc. are also part of the scam. They sell websites that can't be used. Once I started asking questions, everyone disappeared. I couldn't get a hold of anybody. After a year of chasing after them and $40K invested, I had to call it quits. Even with the useless website they provided, the useless video, the fact that they could not file my taxes or keep proper books, I did not receive anything from The Tax Club or their associates that I could use. When I finally was able to reach someone and ask for a refund, they said I had received everything I had paid for. I am now so much in debt that I can't pay my bills.
I dropped The Tax Club two years ago but the more I think about it, it was a scam. The software was awful and I had to do my own research with the IRS and point out the errors that were made in my draft returns. It was a waste of $1500 bucks to join and a waste of $50 a month as I had to do my own taxes using horrible software. I asked for a refund and I was never contacted. Likely the worst company that I have ever seen.
On May 10th, 2011, I spoke with Jacques, a sales representative, who convinced me to purchase from the Tax Club based on false pretenses and lies. He led me to believe that the full cost of my purchases would be 100% returned to me in my taxes the following year. I was skeptical so I asked again if he was referring to 100% returned and he confirmed yes. He then promised that there would be $330 deductions by setting up an S-Corp and asset protection. Based on this, I proceeded to purchase a total of $11,000 from the Tax Club. I was assured that I would receive this amount back to me the following year, so I didn't see a problem if I invested this amount of money. After I had done some thinking, I contacted the Tax Club within my 3-day cancellation period and requested to be cancelled from their programs since $11,000 was a large investment. This was after I had purchased an $8,000 program with PMI. I spoke with a Dean and told him I wanted to cancel and be refunded the money. He then promised me that I could write off all my personal expenses onto the business, which is another lie. Dean convinced to move forward even after I had requested to cancel. He then offered to reduce the amount of the program by $1,500 off of the business planning and business coaching products. I accepted based on what Dean was telling me about my personal and business taxes being returned 100%. Then started the service side of the Tax Club. I was referred to Harvey ** who was a broker to try and get business credit. The only catch was that a $50k line of credit would cost me $6,000. This would be an upfront fee of $6,000 for business credit that I would never use. So in addition to purchasing $8,000 for the coaching with PMI, over $11,000 for the Tax Club, now another $6,000. Where would this end? I immediately said no to this business arrangement and felt that this whole experience was a big scam. A scam to pull more and more money from my pocket. Throughout my whole experience with the Tax Club, my calls were never returned and the conversations that I had with the account managers were terrible. They did not provide any value to me at all. I'm a reasonable person, but this experience was terribly misrepresented and has cost me a tremendous amount of money that I will never recover from.
In November 2010, we got a call from Tax Club inquiring about trying to help us secure our online business with corporate structure. They suggested that we needed some direction and coaching to help us succeed. They then pressured us to join their team of experts. In the enrollment process, they assured us that we could not fail and that we would recoup our investment within 3 months and that the cost of the program was 100% tax deductible, which they led me to believe I would get a credit of $7500 for the year. That was obviously not the case and we are not able to receive the cost back into our taxes. We were totally scammed out of $7500 with the Tax Club. With the amount of money we spent on this program, we should have received expert help and not the misrepresentations and useless material and services that were offered. I left multiple messages and emails asking someone to call me back to discuss my problems with the program. I am extremely upset about my whole experience! I was misled into thinking my success in ecommerce and with the Tax Club would be easier than it has been and that I would be able to recoup my investment quickly and receive the full amount of the cost back in my taxes. I must take action to recoup my money. I’m asking that the Tax Club refund the money so I can move on with my life and put an end to this tragedy.
Since February 2012, I've been working, or so I thought, with the Tax Club and their associates (My Essential Plans, iKongo, All Access Books, GoGo Drop Ship, etc.) to start an e-commerce business. They maxed out my credit card and had me take out another card and they maxed that one also. To this date, nothing has happened. They don't answer my calls, emails, etc. What legal recourse can I take to get my money back? I've been scammed out of over $20,000.
I became upset with the Tax Club in the process of setting up my S-Corp. It was in November of 2011 and they wanted me to send in the paperwork they had prepared after we signed up. I had already gotten my EIN before signing with them and in their process, they had gotten another under the same company name. I now had two EINs under the same name. I contacted them about this problem and they told me that I had to write the IRS and cancel the EIN I signed up for. In talking with the IRS, I was told that S-Corps have to pay a tax of $800 for the year. This was something the Tax Club never informed me of. As it was November 2011, and I was just starting the business and haven't had any sales yet, I asked the IRS agent if I can wait until January 2012. She told me that there is a 15-day grace period so I could file on the 17th of December to avoid the tax for 2011. I felt at the time that the Tax Club should have informed me of this as I was just starting my business and they were the tax experts. I contacted Mark **, about this and I stated that I thought that the Tax Club was supposed to have my back, and why didn't the Tax Club inform me of this. I told him I was dissatisfied and that I want to cancel. I have the emails and my business partner was on the phone with us. Mark ** at that time, had made promises on behalf of the Tax Club, stating they should have known and to keep us on board and restore our faith, he would defer the monthly installments of $49.95 for three months and pay two years of the $800 to help our business get started. At the time I felt that the Tax Club was trying to make things right and decided to stay with them. Mark also stated that when I get my website up and running, to send him a link as he was interested in some of the products I was offering. It took me 5 months to publish, so I went to send him a link and found out that he was no longer with the Tax Club. So I asked the Tax Club representative at this time, if the promises that Mark ** made would still be honored. He asked what promises so I told him what Mark had said. He said that he would have to pull the tapes of our conversation and that they would get back to me, I asked if I could get a copy of the tapes, he told me no as they are the Tax Club's property. When I tried to have the Tax Club make good on their promises, Jerry, my West Coast representative, called me back after two days stating, “The tapes can not be pulled.” (They had mysteriously disappeared). He offered me 3 months of deferred payments and I told him that I wanted to cancel my account. At the time I felt, this $150.00 is nowhere near the $1600 they had promised me. Minutes later, I received an email stating that I would receive a phone call from one of their reps within 48 hours regarding my request to cancel. This was not a request, this was a demand. Today March 14, 2012, I have received another email stating my account is closed. No call, no $1600. Do not, I repeat, do not get involved with this company. They have lied to me, and they will lie to you! They are unscrupulous! There has been over 350 complaints filed against them. Do your homework before talking with or signing on.
I was first contacted to join The Tax Club for $2,000 and $20.00 a month. I paid money for no service. The only thing I have received was an invoice and a newsletter. I have tried several times to send an email, but it keeps returning. I have also tried to phone them and I was on hold for a long time. It costs me a lot of money to phone them. I just want an answer to my question: What have they done for me with my $2,000 and the $20 per month? I'm still waiting on all the help I was to receive with my taxes.
This is the email of The Tax Club via Consumer Affairs: The Tax Club takes any questions and concern seriously, and we always hope that we can find a reasonable and professional solution in our dealings with clients. This client is not being truthful with her facts. First, this client contacted us after two years of her corporation being established, and requesting a refund for work long finished. Her reasons for requesting a refund were personal in nature, and had nothing to do with our performance as a company. Because we had completed the work, and the client had signed each agreement sent to her, we did not feel that she is entitled to a refund based on personal hardships. As a business, we have to be paid for services provided, and have not found employees willing to work for free, so we cannot offer services for free. The client has claimed because we are American, we only care about business and profits. We care about providing a service and being able to pay employees that provide that service, and yes, we should be able to make a profit as well. We are sorry for the client’s personal frustrations, but despite her claims, we have fulfilled our obligations she paid us for and will not issue refunds on work completed. In response to that: No, In fact my LLC was closed down as a result of "delinquent accounting". Please contact the Wyoming folk that the Tax Club set me up with to confirm. Services have not been rendered. I sent TTC an updated address in March 2011, which they didn’t change. I tried to get in contact with TTC in 2011, with nothing received but bounced emails!
As they sold it to me, they were to be an agent that would complete the paperwork and liaise with the resident agent to comply with US bookkeeping requirements. I sent them my paperwork with a letter updating my contact details long before the LLC was subject to a forced closure for "delinquent books". In my instance: Paperwork was not completed on time and contact details were not updated. I received the Wyoming letter from my tenant, months after it had been sent to the outdated address. By which time, for the reason of "delinquent accounting", the LLC had been shut down by Wyoming folk. If a part of the service has been to "comply with US bookkeeping requirements", they have failed.
I was contacted by the Tax Club after signing up with OHN for a website. An employee of the Tax Club, signed me up for a 2010 Business Saver Plus account in June of 2010, in the amount of $4,785.00. Two weeks later, I was contacted by a Jessie, another employee for a further payment of $7,495.00 for Small Biz Credit Solutions and Internet Marketing Success packages. These transactions amounted to $12,370.00, and to date, nothing has eventuated. I was also contacted by **, who stated that he was my main point of contact, and would email me his phone number and email address. To date, this has not happened. I asked him if there were anymore costs to be incurred for this account, and he said no. Two weeks later, I was contacted by **, to discuss bookkeeping, who explained the importance of keeping accurate records, and asked me for a credit card number, for a further $8,990.00 payment, to which I declined, as I didn't have the funds. Andy demanded that I give him another credit card number. I told him I didn't have one, and he replied "you must have", and then became sarcastic and said, "well, what are you going to do now?" He then said he would speak to his supervisor, **, and came back with an astonishing reduced fee of $4,990.00, if I paid it that day. I repeated that I didn't have the funds, and would they call me back the following Saturday regarding this amount. This was the last conversation I have had from anyone at the Tax Club, until I filled in a "how did we do" survey. I received an email with a refund Authorization Form attached, for the insulting amount of $895.00 on the 30th of January this year. I have tried phoning them, but the numbers supplied have all come back with "this number is not available". I then sent a letter, outlining all details to the managing director, and sent it by registered mail. Someone from their billing department phoned me, and still only offered me the $895.00 refund. They then put their customer service person on the phone, to hear my grievances, and also told me that I would not be refunded for any other money, as after all, this was back in 2010. I stated that some responsibility should be accepted for their employees, and that no services have been provided, since paying $12,370 in good faith. I was then phoned back about ten minutes after ending their call, and told they would refund $1,000.00 on the Small Biz Solutions, and $875.00 on the Internet Marketing. They then sent me an email, with two refund authorizations for these amounts. Disgusted and frustrated, I signed them, and returned them by mail on the 15th of February. To date, nothing has been refunded, and as usual, they have not kept their word of refunding as soon as they received my mail. What can I do next?
Net Essential Plans, The Tax Club, contacted me and said they got my file from WhyProsperity whom I was doing business with. They also got my credit card number from them. While talking to me on the phone, they rang up an amount of $1,744.00 although I didn't give them permission. I told them that I don't have that kind of credit left on that card. Nathan said, "Lets just try it." They must have had the complete sale ready to ring up and on the computer because a second later, he said, "Yes, it went through." At that point, I thought they were still connected to WhyProsperity and hoped they really would give me the help they talked of. They continually want more money and give me nothing. Even when they say they will send me something, they don't. I have nothing for that money. They are crooks. Swindlers, hucksters, frauds, amoral. I'd say more but I want my money back and will try to get it.
Initially, I attempted to start an online business in January 2011. I started receiving calls from different people about my website. One of these callers was from The Tax Club which I believed was part of the organization I was doing my website through. Before I knew it, I was into The Tax Club for over $3,000.00 and they wanted more! I finally had to yell at the guy that I had no more credit left to tap to pay him. But like a dummy, I stayed with them in hopes of getting "back in the game" and using whatever services I had paid for. Naturally, I missed the deadline for terminating services before all this was refundable. Interestingly, I never signed anything or sent anything via e-mail acknowledging that I accepted their products. It is a very expensive lesson learned! As I have seen mentioned in other complaints, I am willing to join any class action taken against this company. I have not even bothered to contact them based on the replies they have given to other complaints. I haven't even established my "e-mail" account as the username/password do not even work. They did not even bothered to try and fix it either.
In March 2011, I received a letter from the Franchise Tax State of California, regarding a proposed assessment. The tax return for 2007, filed by the Tax Club on my behalf, had a different income amount, that was on the IRS form. I contacted the Tax Club in March 2011, and was told that they were too busy to handle this now, and would get back to me after the tax season. They also stated that there was time, so I should not panic. When I asked how an experienced accountant could make a mistake of showing the income on the IRS form was different from the State form, their answer was "people make mistakes". Several months later, The Tax Club prepared a new form for the IRS, showing the correct income for 2007, with $5,125 due to me. This was rejected by the IRS as being passed the 3 year deadline. If this claim had been submitted when the issue first arose, it would have been in the 3 year filing deadline for the IRS. Any competent accountant should know that the income should be the same for both IRS and state. The tax Club rep admitted "people make mistakes". The Tax Club alleges that the original W2 was in error. I contacted the company, and was given a copy of the original W2. The personnel department of Inland Pacific Builders will so testify.
In March of 2011, my daughter and I embarked on a venture. We were going to build a web business. The Focus group affiliated with Success Internet and Internet Success provided a coach and instructions for $15,480.00. Within a week, my daughter who has cerebral palsy was diagnosed with cancer which had metastasized from the breast cancer that she had had in 2009. I tried to get out of the deal. Jerry ** and Derek ** spoke with me. Derek told me that he was part of the Focus Group and he and Lee were the guys who get the job done right now. He said that if you don't invest now, you will never make any money. I was told that if I do everything he says, I will be making more money than I will ever need. He said to get a CRM, Marketing, and several other promotional services. I sent a check for $7,450 and was billed $10,000.00 on a credit card. I was billed many other charges totaling nearly $70,000.00. I was told that they would build me a fully functioning website and I would have to do virtually nothing. I spent my whole summer getting products and dropshippers and all the while taking my daughter to radiation and chemo and dealing with her being sick. Derek and Lee and I forgot about Heather. She was supposed to be getting the designers and everything associated to building a functioning website. Derek told me that because of my circumstances with my daughter, he would personally get everything done quickly. I still have nothing worth anything. He did build a pet supply website that is nonfunctioning. All of the products that I gathered and the dropshippers I paid for are of no use. I tried over and over to get a refund. I am about to lose everything and my daughter is still battling cancer. These people should be stopped. They took advantage of me and my situation. They made promises that they had no intentions of keeping. I have lost about $70,000.00 to these people. I am going to go to the Attorney General.
I was pressured to purchase products that I did not need. I purchased a Business Saver Package under very heavy sales tactics by The Tax Club. I had requested to call my personal accountant but they said no one else could set up an internet business as the Tax Club could. I also purchased two other packages through the Tax Club that was bringing my total costs close to $20,000. I have an internet coach that is building my website and guiding me at all levels of my new business. I told him how financially stressed I was and he told me that I did not need any of this company’s products to run my internet business. I then called to cancel all services and was only able to cancel two of the services. The Business Saver Package had passed the cancellation date. I am only requesting $1795 of the $2995 I was charged due that they did provide me with my LLC. The difference of $1200 was to cover the fair market value of the LLC. All of the products that they sold me were already covered in my affiliation with PMI, my business coaching company. I fell that the Tax Club knew I was uninformed as I was only in the first weeks of building my business. Their heavy-handed sales techniques leave little to desire. They are refusing to refund any money to the E-contract that I signed while still on the phone with them. I was not allowed time to even read it.
I was contacted by the Tax Club and they told me that I needed them if I was going to have a successful business, and I needed to purchase their tax service for $3,908, Business Credit Solutions for $3,524, and someone to build the website for $1,395. Once I realized what was going on, I called them up and told them that I had made a mistake and I didn't want their services anymore. I didn't know what I was thinking at the time and if they could refund me back part of what I had invested because really they hadn't done anything for me. They told me that I had 15 days to cancel the services and if I cancelled, I would get nothing in return. I am a senior and I need help. Please help
I was contacted by Jay ** and I was told that they will provide me with traffic on my website between 5,000 to 10,000 visitors. They charged me $2,497.00 and nothing happened. I got a call from Eddy ** and he was supposed to help me get company credit. After we talked about landing institutes, he said that I had to have copyrights and trademark, costing me $5,000 and no more contact. In July of 2011, I received a call from Kevin ** and I was told that he and Alex ** will take over the website and market profit. I was charged $3,000 and I have not heard from them. I made several calls to no avail. So my advice is that Tax Club is a fraud where they target senior citizens.
In mid-2008, my late wife got involved trying to start a web business to add to the shop she already had. She started through Stores on Line and PMI. It wasn't long before we kept getting calls from The Tax Club. She kept agreeing to use their services, to the tune of over $14,000. Unfortunately, my wife passed away shortly after. I contacted The Tax Club and asked for a refund as very little was done by them, but agreed to some of the things that were done. They sent me the refund documents via email, which were completely unreadable. I was contacted by Lango ** and she promised to send hard copies of the forms. When the forms arrived, the names were wrong. I contacted her again to have them corrected. She did and apologized for the problem. By the time I received, signed and returned the forms, I was told that since they were not returned within 30 days, they would not issue any refund whatsoever.
After my first complain, I got some sort of an agreement with The Tax Club that would help me. It did a little bit they cancel the $ 2500.00 Loan, but its not enough I still have an over max-up credit card. So far the service I received it only worth $3000.00 ,I feel I was still over charged ,and I asking for a refund.
We signed up for The Tax Club business essentials and The Small Biz membership to the tune of $5,133.00 on January 2011. Also, on top of that, we paid $14.99 and $29.99 monthly. I had just started an e-commerce website and I was actually still building it when The Tax Club called us. They said that we really needed their expertise. They said that they would build a business plan for us and get us business credit, and not to worry about using all of our personal credit for their cost. I would be able to transfer it all to business credit. Instead, all I got was call after call from people all over the US with The Tax Club, trying to sell me everything they could! I fell one more time for their trafficdriverpro.net scam. It cost me $2,500.00 with guaranteed 1000 unique visitors a month! I called them after a few weeks and told them that I wasn't getting any results and they told me that it would take 4-6 weeks to see the visits coming through. So it's been about four months and no results! No 1000 visitors etc. I called the main number for The Tax Club which is impossible to get a hold of anyone but snotty operators who transfer you to phones that tell you to leave a message. It took two weeks to finally reach Raymond, the guy who is in charge of the trafficdriverpro stuff. Like I said, I even contacted traffic driver pro and I was promised a call back but nothing! We asked for it to be cancelled and refunded because it didn't do what they said it would! They like to argue that we had 15 days to cancel, which they never said, they said that it was guaranteed! Even if it was 15 days to cancel, I called within that time and they told me it takes time, 4-6 weeks for results! Really? How could you even cancel in 15 days if it takes 4-6 weeks to start working?! Anyways, I just got the same e-mail I received, when I cancelled the other tax club membership, that they cancelled the items I requested but I'm not due any refund. So all in all, the company has lied and bilked me out of $7,633.00 and 5-6 months of monthly fees for doing absolutely NOTHING, except to put me and my family back in debt and ruin our credit rating! This company needs to be investigated for their scummy practices. I will be a witness!! Please help me!
I was contacted by PMI and then The Tax Club after sending for Anthony Morrison's Book. Each group relieved me of a significant amount of money to the tune of masking out my credit card. The calls kept coming from others at The Tax Club trying to talk me into more things and programs I should buy, extend my credit and take out a line of credit or let them build my website. I have no website and I became ill shortly after signing up. My account was put on hold and the calls kept coming. The Tax Club assisted me in setting up a "S Corp" in Florida for over $1,200.00 in costs (I'll need to recheck the figures) and after Mark ** sold me the farm, I got a few phone calls from Justin who was of no help at all. I complained in an email on the site and he put my account on hold. I am unable to move forward to begin a business due to declining health. This business never got off the ground and I never even knew what the business was. So I feel quite scammed and I am asking for a refund of my money. I will be inactivating my business and who knows what tax reporting to the IRS I will be responsible for. I never got one word of guidance, direction or anything from The Tax Club. There were just phones calls about paying more money for more affiliate ideas. It was a total scam approach. I never received any of the benefits promised by The Tax Club other than the paperwork to send to the State of Florida and a corporate seal. I attended a few webinars in the beginning but then my illness prevented me from participating. Everytime someone called, I'd ask questions about how all they were promising and talking about was going to happen if I didn't even know what kind of business or product I would be able to sell on this website. No one ever could answer other than to offer another way to empty my bank account and max out my credit card. This last time they wanted $10,000 and they told me to take a loan on my 401K to pay it and that was supposed to be a big bargain. I find it hard to think that this is anything but a scam when the representatives put nothing in writing about what I'm asking or complaining about. The only way we communicate is with the phone and numerous telephone numbers all the time. I would appreciate a refund of my money since I cannot physically or mentally continue as stated early on.
Shortly after signing up with Achieve Technologies I got a call from The Tax Club. The thing that got me was them telling me that I would get the investments I made with them and Achieve back at tax time. In my mind I saw a check from the IRS for at least $9,000. I'm sure that's what they thought I was thinking too. Total credit card debt for this business venture right now is about $12,000. Over $5,000 to The Tax Club. At tax time I already had my personal done. They prepared the corporate and to my surprise they told me I had to amend my personal taxes to show the loss that I had in my business. I don't need to pay less in taxes. I paid them a monthly fee ($49.95) for about 18 months. They helped me incorporate ($225 through legalzoom.com). They prepared my corporate taxes once ($205 for Turbo Tax software and $100 for my sister to prepare them). For the amount of time I was with them I used 2 of their services. How much of the investment with The Tax Club can I get back?
On March 14, 2011, I had a call from Ryan ** stating that I need a business in the United States for me to operate sales in this country with drop shippers as he finds out I was taking a course through Power Seller College. They were charging me $2995 and a monthly fee of $49.50 to access their website, which I did use very little due to limited time I am online. I got my company name set up, that went OK. But after this, on March 21, 2011 James ** called to offer me a Corporate Credit Plan at $4295. I refused at that point as I knew it was more than I can afford. But as persistent he was, he mentioned he'll help me get corporate credit to pay off my credit card debt in a matter of no time. He failed to mention that it will take up to six months and I will have to do all the work. So even if I told him about thrice that I can't, I gave in and maxed out my credit card + $2500 loan with a finance company he chose. Now with all these, I thought I had all planning systems in place to get my company off the ground. Boy was I wrong. I found out I still have to pay more to set up the website, the advertising, the merchant account, and so on as per David ** on March 28, 2011. He said all I paid for is coaching of difference department with The Tax Club. His part was to sell me his coaching plan for the price of $3693 to advertise and analyze the company progress. This was not accepted.
I was contacted by the Tax Club when I had signed up with Fortune Learning Systems (you know that FLS is in court). The Tax Club bullied me into paying them a fee for tax info and also a fee for My Essential Plans to set up an LLC (which I didn't need, but being a Canadian I didn't know that). The Tax Club set up 3 appointments for me and they never kept any of them, when I phoned to complain they said the account rep would phone me back in half an hour. He never did call. When the FTC shut FLS down, I never got an established business going so I did not need an LLC. I cancelled the membership with the Tax Club and asked for a refund, I was told there would be no refund. I complained to everyone I could think of and they responded with the same response they give everyone who complains. They took a goodly sum of money from me, and I would like to see them totally shut down just like FLS.
I signed up for The Tax Club because it was referred to me by legal zoom. At the time I was told there was an initial fee of $1600 and a monthly fee of $20. This ensures tax preparation every year. The first two years went smoothly. Now they are telling me I need to pay $895 a year for tax prep in addition to the $20 per month. I was never told of this fee and they have no documentation of any such fee. The original contract says nothing about a tax prep fee. They have apologized to me for forgetting to mention the $895 per year fee; however, they will not refund any of my money. They also have admitted that there is no documentation anywhere of any such fee. I have two small children to support and a struggling small business. I never would have signed up had I been informed about these fees. If there is ever a class action suit against The Tax Club, I want to be involved. Please contact me. They are very dishonest and I feel like I have been scammed. They are taking advantage of innocent people who are just trying to make a living. Thank you.
On Nov 9, 2010, I've opened an internet e-commerce business and I'm coached by Premier Coaching in the process to learn the business. In the meantime, I've been contacted by Tax Club to take care of my legal paperwork. I've filled them out and sent it to Wyoming Secretary of State. It cost me $2999. As first deposit +$39.95/month that they agree to take only after the third from the third month. I've decided to cancelled my adhesion and hire a personnel accountant to take care of it, in Writing a registered letter to Tax Club, to be reimbursed. No way, sir. First, I'd never get a written answer at my letter but I've been called by M. Corey *** from tax club ( * *** *** **** ext: **** ) to make me understand how profitable it will be to stay with Tax Club. Finally, I'm harassed by a young men who don't want to hear nothing but the care of my business plan that I don't have yet. I don't even have a web site yet. I'm still learning. This is really frustrating and after all complaints I'm reading with clients having the same problems, I think I'll have a hard time to have my money back. A lawyer will charged me $1500 to have my money back. I'm retired with my wife and my handicapped daughter and my finances are not that great. Just enough to live in my fifth wheel. I only want a little Internet home Business to help me out with my budget. Now I'm $12,000 involved in that business and can't afford to spend another penny for the care of that little business. As a Canadian, is there anything I can do to have my money back ($3000 with tax club)? Thanks for your support.
Wow, all the complaints against the Tax Club do ring true in my experience, also. The Tax Club responses are a "boiler plate" form reply stating that they are committed to customers. That's garbage. I also lost a bundle of money to this back room sales operation. They do have accountants but it is their sales tactics that cause so much harm. I endorse a previous posters' comments that the Attorney General of the State of New York should close this company down.
I've read complaints about The Tax Club and I have the same experience. They even connect to my bank on three way communication to activate my credit card which I told them I'm keeping for emergency purposes. To make the story short, I got ripped off by about $20,000. I tried to get refunded but to no avail. I am trying to make payments for my debts that this caused me and am really having a hard time making ends meet. My credit score is ruined because of late payments. No physical damage has been done but a lot of emotional stress.
After signing up with an online hosting service on the 17th June 2010, so that I could supplement my government pension. I was spending time getting my web site up to scratch. On the 30th of July received a phone call from Domonic from the tax club informing me that he had got my name from the online hosting firm and that they would set me up with all the accountancy expertise I would need for the small sum of 4349.74au. I informed him at the time that I did not have that sort of money. He asked me if I had credit cards. I answered yes. He then asked me to affirm the numbers, expiry and security numbers. Next thing I know the money is out of my accounts. They never asked me if I wanted to proceed with anything. They didn't care that it put me over the limit. I was just happy that it went through. I was then rung the following day by Justin *** account ex. He gave me a spiel about the business. I told me I would have to fill out papers and get credit so that the business could pay me back and he would send everything to me then he transferred me to Kelly ***, corporate record pro to explain all the details to me. In between all this toing and froing and tears on my part saying that I couldn't afford any of this. On August 6th, I called from tax club. On August 11th, mail from tax club with application for EIN number and LLC registration to be sent to the Secretary of State in Wyoming. Another 128 tax club supposed to call 17th August, no call. August 24th again no call. August 25th tax club called and they require another $3511.19. How do they know how much is in the account? Web seminar on 26th August, useless. 30th August, no call. 31 August, no call. 1st September, Ronny *** calls... wants another 1700. I told him I didn't have any more and that I was going to look into their dealings and to date I have heard nothing more from them. Apart from the 59.95au, they kept taking out of my account every month so 9708.52au. Later, no word from anyone since my health is shot. My savings are gone. I am trying to live on a government pension that is not enough to keep me alive and all because I was taken in by the tax club scammers. I am 63. What can I do? Any suggestions?..
I was actually contacted by the Tax Club representative who outlined the benefits of membership which included setting up a business entity, why I should have it set up in the US, preparation of business plan, and organizing business credit. All this made sense. So in November 2008, I paid AUD5800 for the membership with ongoing monthly fees. The phone consultations were booked, my LLC was set up on the spot. And that's where the service ended. I was asked to pay further US2000 plus for business plan, more money for business credit card, then about USD2000 for bookkeeping service (with monthly fees). I didn't have any more money and I was taken aback by the Tax Club not being upfront about the costs involved, so I did not proceed. I did pay another US600 for basic bookkeeping service, where I actually kept my records for a while. Until during one of my two accounting consultations I was told that 1/bookkeeping does not communicate with The Tax Club and that it is not necessary for me to use this service. Confusion reigns. For months I couldn't log in to my account as my password didn't work. I didn't receive any communication from the Tax Club other than "thank you for becoming a member" and recurring billing and newsletters. I had a hard time figuring out how the Club operates. I had two consultations, each time with a different accountant. I felt I was fobbed off, which was easy as I am totally new to being a business owner, let alone in the USA. The latest accountant advised me to alter the registration of my LLC. I had to chase the paperwork, which was meant to be emailed to me--it wasn't. Then IRS had a problem with my paperwork.I emailed The Tax Club about it. The last communication I had regarding the subject was asking me to send the IRS letter and someone will be contacting me. No one did. And I haven't heard back from The Tax Club since. Tax time came, I made a phone call to customer service to find out about the technicalities of tax return. I needed to purchase VTO (virtual tax organizer). I logged in to my account successfully but when I pressed the "buy VTO button", error message appeared "account cannot be found". This problem was never resolved. In the process, however, I found another piece of information that had not been disclosed before I signed up for membership: the cost of the tax return, and that there is an extra charge for VTO. I don't know how much it is because I could not get to the purchase site. I sent a number of emails requesting an itemized invoice; i.e. what exactly was included in the membership. Interestingly when I made inquiries at a corporate business website I found on the Internet, I was provided with very clear information and clear step-by-step instructions as to what I will need to organize. I then realized that not only did The Tax Club fail to disclose all financial information, but also did not provide structured information like EIN number to file taxes, does my LLC have one SS4 form (apparently I need one), who my resident agent is, DUNNS number application. Up to this point I didn't even know enough to ask questions. I think this makes for a really poor service. I sent emails to customer care email address, appointments@thetaxclub, billing@thetaxclub. All emails were returned to my mailbox. Apparently the mail system was unable to deliver. My latest emails were sent Aug. 16, Sept. 16 and Sept. 24. I received no reply. Until Sept. 25 I received communication from the billing at The Tax Club that my account has been cancelled and that they are sad to see me go. What a joke. Reading the accounts of other Tax Club users, it seems that this organization deliberately targets individuals who are very new to business and therefore are vulnerable and naive. I am really surprised that they continue to be in business. Isn't there any consumer protection in the US?
In February of 2010 I decided to start an online business in advertising. I was contacted by the Tax Club who said they could do a number of things one of which was getting my business set up as an LLC entity. Upon naively paying $2,999 plus I realized that the refund period of 15 meager days had already came and gone. After 5 months of being in business to date my company has not made a single penny. The Tax Club sent me my Articles of Incorporation in a binder (I could have gotten my own Articles of Incorporation!) and say they deserve all of that $3,000. I tried to get a refund but it was too late and as they say the rich get richer and the poor get poorer, when companies like the Tax Club suck everything they can out of a low income American. Isn’t there any lawyer who could initiate a class-act lawsuit against these bottom feeders? I am currently living with my mother who is on the verge of losing her home, my cell phone has been turned off because of non payment, and my business I put over $10,000 into has not made a penny. The emotional damage of having everything taken from you has greatly taken its toll on my own happiness. I feel there is nothing anyone can do to stand up to these frauds.
I have had some of the same experiences as the ones that I read. I would like to know what each did to resolve these as I would like to know of a place to take my matter with the Tax Club. It seems that they should be investigated. I have spent a lot of money with them as they claimed that I would recoup this in my business. I just went further in debt and now have no money left with which to build my business.
After being ** enough to be ripped off for $43,386.72, we found this was just a scam with a lot of associated companies that every time the phone rang, it was somebody different asking for more money. There was bookkeeping, planning, credit and lots more also a website which never happened, which they kept spelling wrong. That's when they stopped phoning us. We wrote emails to ask what was happening and they replied they would look into it. We then got a phone call telling us we needed to spend another $600. We said no. No more phone calls, no nothing until we were contacted by Ester ** to see if we wanted to cancel our membership. In the meantime, they are charging us $50 a month to do nothing. We cancelled and asked for a refund. No, we are not getting any refund. Please help. What can we do?
Heavy sales pitch got me for 2,975 plus 49.95 a month starting 12/09. As soon as my credit ran out, so did the service [as they continued to run roughshod over my good credit score without regard until it was tapped] and hung me out to dry. No refund as of 5/10 and no returned calls. A perfect example of bate and switch and scam like business practice. Please stay away from anything to do with the tax club and the Manhattan professional group. Since my credit was tanked by these crooks it was necessary to enter a debt reorganization program and try to get back on track before I get an ulcer or lose my marbles. Here's hoping for some financial recovery from an unemployed American. PS. with friends like this who needs enemies.
Well, I too was scammed out of a lot of money from the Tax Club and A Way of Life/IW Solutions. I am a single mom, disabled with a disabled child on SS Disability and VA Disability under a doctor's care for severe depression, sleep apnea and chronic back pain related to surgery (a fusion). I only make $2,100 a month. Well I received a call from IW solutions, wanting me to do an online business (which I knew nothing about). He convinced me that I would be able to make all my money back in 6 months guaranteed. If I could not, they would refund all the money invested. Well, I had no money to invest. Usually, I am very smart when it comes to money and doing something that I do not have the money to pay for but this time, I guess I was weak or stupid or whatever. Actually, this happened when I was not sleeping and had not started using the CPap which I have to do due to the apnea. I just was not or could not think clearly. He convinced me to use my credit cards which I had excellent credit. It almost seemed as they knew what my credit rating was and how much credit I had available. I was told initially that I would have 1 hour a week for 6 months, 1-on-1 training and could call them any time for any help I would need. I continued to tell them that I knew nothing about doing a website or anything and again I was convinced that anyone could do this even if they had no experience on the internet or computer. Finally, I agreed. My daughter was getting impatient and I needed to get her dinner, as I had been on the phone with him for about 1 hour. It would only cost $8,230.00, my goodness only $8,230.00. I told him that I could not stand another bill and I was convinced that I would make it back even before the first bill was due. Wow! That would be great. That to me, $8,230.00 was almost a years income of disability payments. I kept asking to call me back tomorrow and he kept convincing me that now was the best time. So I agreed I would put it on my card and would pay it all back in 6 months. It would only take about 16 hours a week to get the "Business" up and running. So I talked with my therapist the next day and he made me aware of the mess I was getting myself in so I called him to cancel the deal. It had only been 2 days, he would take no for an answer. I even told him that I was advised against it from my psychiatrist. He still would not accept no and convinced me that I could not go wrong and sent me a warranty that said if I had not made my money back in 6 months that they would refund it all or what I had not made in writing. I thought okay, how can I loose with a money back guarantee, right? Wrong. Then all these other people started calling from the Tax Club, even before I knew anything about starting the business or anything. I kept telling them I had no business at this time. They kept telling me I needed this and I could just use the same card I used for the Training at IW Solutions/Apply Knowledge Institute. So I thought that I had to do all this because they knew all about the business and my credit and credit card. So IU agreed to the Tax Club. I had to have it, they said I needed business license, corporate records, corporate binders, etc. They would have other people to call me also that was with the Tax Club so I initially thought that I would get all the other services included. I was guaranteed a loan to start the business and all, they would do my business plan, logo for the business and everything and I could work on getting the business ready to go. Everyone who called wanted more money. I expressed my disappointment with each entirety that called my bill was climbing and I was not looking forward to a payment. Each person that called wanted $2,000-3,500 or more. I do have it all written down but not with me at the present time. To make a long, long story short. I worked everyday from about 8 am until 9-10 a night with just an hour or so off to go pick up my daughter at school and get her something to eat. My medical condition seemed to deteriorate more and more every day and my "coach" for the business would call one time a week for 30 min., not 1 hour as promised. For the first month, I was looking around my own home to find stuff to put on eBay. This was not going to make me any money. I had to pay to put things on there too. I worked from 8-10 for 4 months. I then called and talked to them (Apply Knowledge) and explained that I was not well and my doctor did not want me doing this as it was detrimental to my health. I was informed they could not give me my money back. I talked with Dave S. first and at that time, I was not aware that IW Solutions who sold me the plan and Apply Knowledge was not the same place, as I had talked to a lay named Megan both times when I talked to Mike ** and the people at Applied Knowledge. I was confused and he (Dave) got very angry with me and was actually very hateful and mean the first time we talked. I kept trying to tell him what had happened and when and he said that Megan was his secretary and not with IW Solutions. I then talked with another lady about 1 month later from another part of 1 of the businesses (not sure which at this time). She instructed me she would send me some suppliers that did drop shipping which was what this mess was all about. It was all garbage things not going to make my money back with them. As instructed by my doctor, I was sick, could not sleep, eat, drive or do very good at taking care of my daughter. Especially, after I would go to sleep while driving, this is when I quite trying to do this "Business". I cancelled the Tax Club mess and was informed that I could not get any of my money back except the $859 for doing my taxes well. What did I need them to do my taxes for, I had made no money and just lost about $25,000.00. No business, No loan as promised, nothing. They faxed me a form to sign to release them of everything and they would refund the $859.00 for doing my taxes. I have not and will not sign it. All this mess has ruined my credit and my life. Please beware. If it sounds too good, believe me it isn't. I have ruined my credit. I went from having a 730-740 credit score to probably a 600 last time I checked and that was a month ago. I am going to go bankrupt, in debt of $25,000 for the "business" and $18,000 personal. I cannot make the payments. I probably will loose my home and then my daughter and myself will be on the street, because if I go bankrupt then I was told I would have to sell my 2005 Honda CRV which is paid for. If there is anything I can do please help. Thanks for listening.
It started when I purchased dean's books. A few weeks later, I was solicited by a phone call. I was then told by these people that they happen to call them selves PMI (professional marketing) that I could get a refund on the course if I went with the tax club, the course was around 3700 dollars. I then agreed with the tax club that I would get a refund on my course and then I would get a refund off there price as well. they charge around 3500.00, so as you can see this is a lot of money to be falsely mislead into a course that I could of put together for 10.00. It was now tax time and I was told I could not refund anything because I did not make anything. This was a big blow. I then told PMI that I wanted my money back and that I wasn't satisfied with the course. I was then told that I was with the program for to long and see what the tax club has to say. I called the tax club and then told them I wanted a refund as well and they said we can refund you 895.00 for not doing your taxes. I told them I wanted the whole bunch back and then asked if the conversation was recorded and then they said yes it was. I said great I would like to listen to it. They told me that they would review it and they would get back with me. I said sure. I still haven't heard from the tax club and it has been over 2 months ago. The guy I talked to with the tax club was Cade, he was the one that mislead me into the scamming tax club I am out a bunch of money I have my credit cards reviewing the tax club I'm not sure if I will when the dispute but that's alright I will apply for bankruptcy and I will laugh all the way to court knowing that the United states of America has these scamming people inside it. I will just have to say this was one hard lesson to learn about scammers.
Just like everyone else, we were struggling with the economy. I found an incredible product and was on my way to an ideal lifestyle. I then got a call from someone claiming to be from the company that I had just signed with. Only until they got my credit card number did they reveal that they were "The Tax Club." I started to receive high pressure sales call after sales call with more and more services. They claimed that I would get it back on my tax return. That did not happen. After "investing" $20K of credit that I could not afford, I noticed charges for consultations that didn't even take place. Once they got my money, they put me out to dry. They didn't even get me a tax return. They tell me that it's my fault and it is. I should have done some research before signing up with them. I now have relationship/trust problems with my family (they don't trust me and they think I am an idiot). We now have to file for bankruptcy to get rid of this debt left behind from all of the "help" I got from the Tax Club.
I tried to open an on line business but still in the beginning stages on the business. I received a call for the tax club and they convince me I needed to have my business incorporated which I really did not. The only thing I needed was to get a license. I had no idea about anything about a business. They also convince me to buy this other package where I will get a business loan, business credit card, a grant or angel money where I do not need to repay back the money. The person from Chase even told me it is a con game but could not do anything about helping me. Now, Chase sent the bill to a collection agency for the money and now they are calling me constantly to talk to me. The tax club has so many complaints against them and still doing business. I was con into this deal and they lied to get my money. When I filled a complaint with the BBB, they agree to pay partial of my money but I want full reimbursement because of the situation. Then someone else called me and wanted another $3,500.00 to solve the problem and I said to stop calling me. Also, I want you to know that I always tried to call when I got home and left messages and they called me during the day when I told them to call me after 7PM in the evening. I was not able to get a hold of them for one whole month and they did not do anything for me but took my money. I paid them $6,690.00 and want a full refund.
I have had the unfortunate opportunity of dealing with the Tax Club. They prepared my taxes for 2009 for a fee of $895 and I only got back around $800 for my federal return. This year, I wasn't going to use them but they insisted that since I had an S-Corp to claim a loss on, shouldn't I try to get that money back? So long story short, another $895 for tax prep because they were going to try to recover my money. My return looks like this: I'm getting $580 back Federal. I owe $22 to the state, as well as $130 for estimated taxes and another $788 to the state for business purposes. So needless to say, I am now going to H&R Block and file a new personal return, less the business return, because I already paid the state I live in $520 in estimated tax. I lost over $12,000 which the Tax Club did not get back for me and wants me to pay another $130 + $788 to the state. I'd have to be a fool to file there return. I'm claiming a loss. I paid my estimated tax. I owe nothing to the fed. The state, as far as I'm concerned, is happy. It is my advice to anyone who gets a call from a company called the Tax Club to hang up. If you haven't done business with them, don't. I remain over $12,000 in debt, event though they were supposed to help me get money back. They knew I wouldn't get a good return but took my money anyway.
My complaint to the Tax Club: I have recently cancelled my account and requested a refund of 85% of the initial setup fee on 2/10/09, within the 30-day grace period described in the Tax Club letter of engagement. I received a refund authorization form for the amount of $352.45, which is not 85% of the $1497.00 I paid for the initial setup fee. There are itemized deductions reducing my refund that I disagree with. The Tax Club apparently associates a retail value to the products and services it claims to have rendered, but they seem arbitrary and are not detailed anywhere on the website that I can find. I don't see why the Welcome Package which I was charged $100 dollars for was not covered under the 15% administrative fee already deducted from my refund. It was a brochure and a blank pad in a binder, the retail value of which at Staples would have been considerably less. I wasn't aware that the 10 minutes I spent on the phone with the representative who explained to me that the Tax Club only offered "tax strategy advice" and not filing services for the cost of membership as I was made to believe, would constitute a "New Client Orientation" and cost me another $100 from my refund. The "Tax Plan" that the Tax Club is claiming another $595 from my refund for, was nothing more than a generic tax advice booklet. Most of the information in it didn't pertain to my business needs at all. A book like this costs under $20 at Barnes and Noble. The "Accounting Assistance" was scheduled by the Tax Club, not requested by me. I am still being charged $125 from my refund for it. Was the "accountant" I spoke to even certified? His professional advice to me on the subject of payroll was to "get help. " The only other "Accounting Assistance" call I received wasn't assistance at all, but a marketing call designed to sell me more services. No thanks! I have enclosed a revised version of the refund authorization sent to me by the Tax Club. It is the only refund authorization I am inclined to sign, as I believe that the Tax Club's products and services have been fraudulently misrepresented to me. I was refunded a small amount of my setup fee, but not nearly the 85% that was promised with the 30 day grace period. I lost a significant amount of money on a scam. End of story, I guess. Please respond to this letter upon receipt. I am willing to negotiate my refund personally, but will not hesitate to involve the NY Attorney General and the Better Business Bureau if I feel my complaint is being ignored and 85% of my initial setup fee is not returned to me.
I received a call from the Tax Club. It was deceiving right from the start. I was offered a website "just like Best Buy." I was thinking about owning a website and electronics sounded good. Christmas is coming. So I accepted the offer and was "on my way." I was really confused, hind sight is 20/20. I thought this was included with the website. Wrong! This was tax help for the website I didn't even have yet. It was not set up; it was not registered with the state. I was getting calls daily. They were like high pressured sales calls. I used my credit cards to finance this website. Finally, 2 months later, I found out I didn't have a website yet. I have to purchase it, through The Tax Club. This is after they pressured me into buying other services for a website I don't even have. At this point, I can't afford to purchase another service. They said no problem and financed me through Duvera (aka Prestige). Then a couple months later (still no website), I decided I was over extending myself with this and decided I want to cancel my account with The Tax Club. Oh my! I called there to cancel my account and I was told there would be "no refunds.” The contract states you have 2 weeks from the day you sign to cancel your membership. That is so ridiculous. Two weeks is in no way long enough to realize what you are getting your self into. And I was receiving "sales calls" more than 2 weeks after I signed. So, yes, I contacted the BBB and I am now in the process of contacting the Attorney General of New York. I really hope the Attorney General will start doing something about this company. It's a scam and do not fall for it. This company had deceived me and is an emotional let down. It is costing me economic hardship. I have to keep paying for a website I never had! Or my credit will be ruined. I don't have a high paying career. I am supporting myself and this is really hard on me financially.
I initially signed up with The Tax Club based on an ad I saw at LegalZoom.com. I paid an initial one-time $1500 payment plus $20/month. After I signed up, they said that they wanted to schedule phone calls with me to discuss my tax planning. I assumed this was to help with preparation of my tax records for the preparation of my tax return. It turned out that every call (there were about six calls scheduled) were to sell additional cost services to me. Plus the sales approach was combative. Regardless, The Tax Club did prepare my 2008 tax return to my satisfaction. I received a call today (12/30/09) that was to discuss the status of preparing my 2009 tax return. I found out that I was going to have to spend an additional $850 to have the 2009 tax return prepared even though I had paid the initial $1500 fee plus I had been paying the monthly $20 fee that I thought was to go towards the preparation of my current year tax return. It turns out the $20/month fee was only for access to tax consultants. So I cancelled my account. I can prepare my own business/personal tax return at much lower cost using TurboTax's business/home tax software. The Tax Club is a ripoff.
We were solicited by The Tax Club to buy their services for a start up business in real estate. We did not want to use our personal credit cards for this because we hadn't even started our business yet. We were pressured by them to use our cards, but that after we received our business articles and corporate binder, we would be able to get a small business loan from any bank and transfer any and all start up costs onto our business entity, which is the service they offered us--setting up an entity, in this case an s-corporation which was unnecessary as we had no "assets" to protect. They knew when they said that that it was a lie, just a way to get us to buy. After we received our articles of incorporation and was then refused a loan, we contacted a lawyer who told us we were lied to. There was no way we would be able to walk into a bank and get a loan. We never would have used our personal cards had we known it would end up like this. By this time, we were past the time allowed for a full refund. It is my contention that they knew all they had to do was get us past that grace period and we'd be stuck with all charges. They talked us into incorporating ourselves (which was totally unnecessary) and convinced us that we needed them to do this. In our naiveté, they sold us a bill of goods that not only were unnecessary, but also over priced. As a result of this trickery, I am faced with multiple credit card charges that I can not dispute because the time allowed for disputes has passed. They charged my credit card $2,995.00, plus a recurring monthly charge of $49.95 and an additional $895 for tax preparation. We've cancelled the "services" they sold us, but they refuse to refund our money. They haven't even credited our cards with a prorated charge. They are simply keeping everything. As a result, my credit rating is suffering, my credit lines have dropped, and my interest rates have skyrocketed. I am falling deeper into debt because of these unscrupulous sales people, and all I want is to be credited back the charges and get them out of my life.
I decided to start an internet business. I received a call from their marketing department about setting up an LLC. The person that sold me the training package said to decline but listen to what they have to say. Upon declining I was told I should first make enough money with my training (over $30000) to require the need of an LLC and just focus on learning how to make a profitable website. Later I received a call from The Tax Club stating that "I don't know where you heard that information but you must set up an LLC if you want to start an online business.” The guy's first name was Hanna but he never stated his last name (the first sign of a scam). After a convincing speech I charged the $3999 for the Canadian start-up package (over $4600 Canadian at the time to my credit card) and asked "will there be any other big expenses to start up?" He said, "No you'll just have to get a business license that will cost about $200 max (turns out I don't even need a business license for e-commerce in Alberta). Later I received a call from The Tax Club about appointments with people that could "help me in starting my business". The first call was from Chad ** from Small Biz Credit. He stated the company had a "28 step process to remove all debt from you name in chunks at a time over 6-8 months.” I was offered 2 packages: silver and gold. Silver was a do-it-yourself package for $1999 US and gold was a let-us-do-it-for-you package at $2999 US. I purchased the gold package ($3700 Canadian at the time) in good faith that they would take care of all the complications. Upon signing up I received an e-contract (that is just as legally binding as a written contract) that required my signature. After taking care of this I received an email stating I had 2 new lines of credit for All Access Books and My Essential Plans for $1000 each to put toward that investment if needed. A week later I received a call from Frank ** of All Access Books offering me book keeping services via The Tax Club for $2499 and $99 quarterly (all of which he said were all tax deductible). I declined and he lowered the price to $1499. Upon further declining he offered me the service for $300 US with the remainder payable at $50 US per month. He also seemed to know nothing about the $1000 credit line from Small Biz Credit. I refused the deal (my first smart move in all of this). Later I contacted Small Biz Credit for assistance in filling out the application (I called Chad ** and he referred me to the staff at that company). At first they stated that I need to have a business set up in the US but after telling them I lived in Canada and was told they could help the response was, "Just fill out the application the best you can and we'll get back to you.” A week later their website went down and they still charged me $49 US monthly. I later called them twice asking them how to get corporate credit. They gave me great responses over the phone and said they would send me an email detailing what I need to do. One staff member said she arranged for a business loan department to contact me and she would email me the information. To this day I have not received any emails from Small Biz Credit and their website is still down. I invested almost $10000 in setting up an LLC with The Tax Club. My LLC is set up but they filed the company address at my apartment (no protection whatsoever). The company that is coaching me on web design has helped me a lot so far but they ask me how The Tax Club got my information. If I didn't have a solid paycheck from my other job, I'd be declaring bankruptcy from these crooks. Avoid The Tax Club at all costs.
My complaint is with the Tax Club and the fact that you sold my name to an untrustworthy, lying company. When they contacted me and wanted to set up my corporation, I specifically asked them if it was the same program as StoresOnline, as to a corporation, full personal and corporate asset protection and a living trust. Their answer was yes. I asked them no less than 3-5 times and always got the same answer, yes. So I allowed them to set up my corporation. Then they contacted me about setting up a bookkeeping service. They informed me that as a corporation, I needed to file reports with the IRS, immediately or within the first 30 to 60 days of setting it up. After I signed up, I found that all they were going to do for $1,000.00 for the first year was to allow me to use their online spreadsheet so that I could put my figures in and print out a report for my taxes at the end of the year. I contacted Frank **, the salesman, and informed him that he had lied to me and of my dissatisfaction in the way Tax Club does business. I was informed that his supervisor would contact me. In the meantime, I contacted a CPA who informed me that no quarterly reports are ever due by the IRS. She did explained that estimated taxes are the only thing that is due quarterly. When his supervisor called me, I told her that before she tries to lie to me, I have already contacted a CPA and know the answers. She admitted that there are no quarterly reports due and that she would refund my money. Then their corporate credit people contacted me and again, proceeded to lie to me and try to hand me a line of **. Since I have figured this company out, I proceeded to let the guy know he was full of crap and that I do not do business with liars and thieves. The problem that has yet to be resolved is the fact that the Tax Club did not nor does it use the same legal program as StoresOnline, as they had told me. My corporate structure is all screwed up and my assets are dangling in the wing. My corporation now needs to be dissolved and I have to start all over again. When I spoke with Anthony ** from Tax Club, he kind of acknowledged that they did not do what I had requested and agreed to draw up the disillusion papers and return my money. This is not acceptable since I am out not only the money for their no services, but also filing fees, postage, 2 months of income since I cannot open a bank account without the corporate papers, as well as interest on my credit card. What they did is lie to me and screw things up beyond belief. Had they told me they do not do what I asked for, I would have never done business with them. What the Tax Club had also done is put PMI, StoresOnline and themselves in a possible legal mess. I want this matter resolved in a fair and equitable manner, and I want PMI to help in negotiating and resolving this matter since you sold my name to them and they are an affiliate of yours. If this matter cannot be resolved, then I will be forced to file a lawsuit in which I will name all 3 companies and we can then battle it out in a jury trial. I want to be fair about this, but Tax Club knowingly screwed me out of not only two months income, but also two months exposure of my site online. I sincerely hope that you can persuade Tax Club to resolve and settle this mess they created so that it can be put to rest.
I contracted with StoresOnline to set up an on-line marketing website. They told me that I needed to have a good tax accounting firm to handle the business and they referred me to The Tax Club out of New York. I have paid them the up-front fees and $49.95 per month and have received nothing useful in return. They did my 2005 tax return which indicated a $5000 refund. The IRS said I was only due $2000. When I called The Tax Club to get it straightened out they offered to sell me another contract to contest the IRS ruling. They did not stand behind their return. Obviously, I refused and handled it myself. When I tried to do my 2006 return on their system it kept reverting to the 2005 information. I finally gave up on them and now use TurboTax with much better and more professional results. I believe that The Tax Club is a scam. I would like a refund of all my monthly payments from 2005 on since they have done nothing for me and didn't stand behind their work. I seriously doubt that I have any legal redress since I, too, was a naive neophyte who signed their contract without review by an attorney.
I signed up with The Tax Club after they convinced me that owning a business would require a lot of financial knowledge and they were the ones to do this. It cost me $1518 to enroll and then $29.95/mo. They promised they would be able to get an extra $1000 in tax savings over my prior year's return. I was unable to meet their deadline to give them all my tax stuff in 2 weeks as they need it by February so I ended up waiting until 2008 return to finally get this done. Their process is hard to understand and there are no prompts to click to ask for more information as there are in TurboTax or TaxCut programs but I finally got it all in. They returned my tax returns giving me only $10,727 but my return from the year before was $11,934 so this did not give me an extra $1000 but was actually less. I also had done my own taxes to be safe and was able to get myself using H&R Blocks TaxCut $12,701 so I know I should have been able to get more. They claim they are professionals with the knowledge of business tax deductions so I don't understand why they wouldn't know more than just a TaxCut program. When I asked for my money back, they replied that it had been more than 90 days. There was not anything about 90 days to finish my tax returns. I had joined in August so I don't know which year they thought they could have done my tax returns for within 90 days. I responded about this and the most they would do is to cancel my $29.95/mo but I still had to pay an additional month as now they are saying they also needed 5 days' notice to also cancel the billing. My guarantee says that if they are unable to get me $1000 more than the prior year's tax return, then they would either give me $1000 in additional services or return my money. I have asked for my $1518 return but they are saying the poor tax return that they gave me that would cost me a loss of $2430 is what the additional services is. They claim this tax return cost $1415 which is outrageously expensive. You would think anyone who would charge that much would also do a much better than average job of the return but they didn't even do better than the TaxCut program. Since when does someone guarantee a product or your money back or a replacement of it but only gives you back the same defective product and says they gave it to you whether you like it or not? I paid $1518 to enroll plus had to continue paying the $29.95/mo until I could get my taxes done which amounted to $898.50 plus an additional month since they supposedly need an additional 5 days to cancel something so another $29.95. Luckily I didn't use their return or I would have lost an additional $2,430.
I was contacted by The Tax Club shortly after starting my s-corp. Being brand new to business and feeling overwhelmed and confused with tax matters, I agreed to join The Tax Club after a phone conversation with a representative explaining their services. The initial enrollment cost me $1200.00. I had about 2 other calls within 2 weeks going over what to expect from the company and what to do for tax write offs. On the third call, the guy explained all this great stuff and then asked for $2,400 more dollars to continue. I then asked him "how on earth they felt they were helping small business by taking all of their money?". He replied aggressively stating "well, who else are you going to get to do your taxes?". I was upset and told him I wanted to cancel out everything. He tried to continue to talk over me, trying to make me believe that no one else could provide his service". After refusing to continue, I was given a number to someone to cancel my membership. I sent the "tax plan" books back as well. They would not refund my books at all yet wouldn't send them back. I was sent an email of my refund amount and it did not say $200.00, it was more like $1,080.00. When I faxed it back, they called to tell me they sent me incorrect information and the refund was only for $200.00 and I would not be awarded the amount on the original form. The second form they sent me had deductions for every phone call/conversation I participated in and for "tax plan books" they sent me. I never returned the second notice to them because I did not agree with what they were doing and I am owed the original amount they said. Between the phone calls and with customer services pleading my case, the 2-week time period had passed for a refund and I couldn't get anything back. I feel that this company takes advantage of first time business owners and rips them off big time! This is a warning, you do not need this services. There are qualified tax preparers out there to handle your needs. I don't see how these people sleep at night.
I bought the Dean Graziosi real estate book. Someone from PMI called, asked me to join them. They would teach me how to buy houses. I said okay on 4/02/09. Then a week went by, and The Tax Club called. They sounded very professional and they talked you in to joining for one time fee of: 1) $895.00 for a scope of services, of one business and preparation of 2009 taxes, 2) a one time fee of $2,995.00 plus a recurring fee of $49.95 each month. I said okay because I had never been in business and they said I needed this to continue. On 4/24/09, they wanted me to join My Essential Plans for $3693 and they said I have to join Small Biz Credit Solutions for $2,995 with a recurring charge of $49.95. I told them I really didn't want it. They said I needed this to continue. So I said okay. If I canceled before 30 days, I'm charged 15% processing fee. If it occurs after 30 days, no refunds. So, I called them and emailed them to cancel my stuff. They will not take no for an answer. They lie, very much all of them. Now my 30 days are over and they said it's too late. I called my credit card and they can't do anything because I said it was okay for them to charge my cards. Now on 5/2/09, they're charging me another $49.95 recurring charge for the complete business package and another $6000. Please, can someone help?
I started a small business on the internet and I got calls from all kind of places. The Tax Club was one of them and talked me into things I did not need. I called and canceled within 3 days of signing and sent back their paperwork. They told me that it was too late because they already did things so I could not get the $400 back for the Essential Planning. What they did was fill out papers that I could have done myself and they filled out a paper for an LLC which I did not want. They sent me the paper for the LLC and said that I had to attach a check for it. The Small Biz charged $300 and when I canceled it, they said they would keep $45 for administrative fees. I should get my $300 back because I canceled and they should not have billed my account. I have MS and all this stress does not help me. I was looking for something that I could do from my home.
My girlfriend signed up for the service for me as a gift (near Christmas '08), December 11th, 2008. She told me about it and I asked what they do and why would she spend that kind of money. I knew I wouldn't need or use their services. I then called up the next day, Dec. 12th, and tried to cancel. They needed her on the phone to talk to me, so I did a three-way call. She previously asked them to put me on her account and then she told them to add me again on that call. (It just got confirmed yesterday that I should have been on her account since that day. However, I was not and learned about it in April.) So, we talked and I requested to cancel and we were due a full refund. (California has a 3-day right of recision.) She was contacted by their cancellation department in which she spoke to Mike **. She informed him it was a bad time for her as she was driving. He asked her why she was cancelling and she informed him because of her partner. He then pushed a six months free program to her. She was hesitant stating that it wouldn't help her any. (The phone call lasted 17 minutes and she drives stick.) I believe she was fed up trying to get this man off the phone and said sure. I was not once contacted by this company and I had no idea that this call transpired on Dec. 15th until just this last April 2009. We waited until mid January to see if there was a refund posted. Not seeing any, we filed a dispute with American Express. They took three months and came back with a "Sorry, it looks legit" ** answer. My girlfriend is soft spoken with a partial speech impediment and has been in special ed classes before. I hate to see her being taken advantage of by these no good crooks, who took her $4,000. When I called in this April, they made an executive decision to not refund the money because she said yes (which she didn't) to continuing 6 months free. We have not once opened their ** packages, still have them, and we have not once logged into their site, yet they claim they have provided good on their services. I was supposed to be on the account. They should not have gone around me like this. Be warned.
I, like many others here, have been conned out of many thousands of dollars. I also had a very good credit rating. They insisted that all these expenses for the payroll, document center, logo & marketing package, business plan, S-corporate papers, tax accountants, etc. had to be in place by the end of the year for the government to accept your business as a legitimate company. Well, I fell for it, hook, line and sinker! Of the near $30,000 I spent through all of their other entities, I received maybe $2,000 worth of actual services. And when they could not get any more money from my credit cards, they wouldn't even do my taxes. I had to find someone else to do them. This company and all of its other little entities are vultures, preying on the little people who are trying to fulfill a dream.
I began working with an online company back in October of 2007 to set up my own business. They recommended The Tax Club for all of the financial set-up. I received several calls from them and they convinced me to sign up with them at a rate of $2,018.00 and a reoccurring monthly charge of $19.95. They convinced me to set up my business as a C-Corp and I needed a registered agent in my area for legal purposes which cost me $795 and $22.00 a month. I received numerous calls from them pushing other services they offered. They were very pushy, I had a hard time saying no. In my naive nature I signed up with them for Vital Payroll at $1845, ll Access Books at $2,395 with a $99 monthly charge, Corporate Records at $195 with a $7.95 a month charge, Manhattan Professional Group - Business Docs for my monthly records/meeting minutes at $1249 and paid to have a business plan written up for $24,98. I was with The Tax Club for 5 months for a total of $11,739.50! To top it off, the man who did my taxes for 2007 convinced me that since I didn't have the business up and running and hadn't made any money yet, I should file the 2007 business expenses with the 2008 (so he wouldn't have to do the work!). The guy also messed up our personal taxes and had to file an amendment! When I canceled my membership All Accesses Books gave me a refund of about half the original fee: $1,197.50 and sent me a copy of the records they had done up to that point, which of course didn't include anything from 2007. I now have 3 credit cards because The Tax Club pushed me to keep signing up for more of their services. I finally said no to one of their services when I had no more credit to use. I'm sure somewhere along the way, there are more expenses but these are the ones I can remember at the moment.
BE AWARE - this company uses many toll free numbers to avoid being found on BBB. Salesperson sold a bill of goods claiming, if you are dissatisfied, you have 30 days to cancel. After sending our SSNs openly on the internet, filling out our IRS forms incorrectly and failing to document one thing correctly, we decided to cancel only to find out that their 15% cancellation fee is padded by an imaginary list price of services, resulting in NO refund.
$1000-$2000? The contact that was pushing us wanted $6,385!! Several times, he called this a 1-time fee. Then he says there will also be a $50 monthly fee! Are these guys on crack? My husband and I were already turned off by the slimy tactics this salesperson was endorsing to avoid paying taxes. Then when he slammed us with the cost (he earlier asked us our current income, hmm...), we started laughing out loud. Of course, if you don't have $6K floating around, try Package B - for a measly $5,135...No? How about Package C for a trifling $3,890 (plus the monthly fee)? The guy was unbelievably pushy and when we said we weren't interested, he accused us of not being serious about our new business!! My husband and I were both livid after that, but the guy would not end the call even though we said we had to go (we really did have a small medical problem). I will hang up on a person that ticks me off to that extent, but my reasonable spouse will not. After a time, it was apparent that this guy was not going to let go, so we finally did hang up. This person was no CPA with expert advice. He was incapable of adding and subtracting simple figures ($100 - $30). His only job was to push product. Needless to say, we were quite displeased with the whole conversation. To make matters worse, it has put a scar on any future relationship that we have with the company that recommended Tax Club's services. Just in...the endorsing client is dropping Tax Club! Yeah!!
Misstated what I would receive, bait and switched services, never received the help promised, gave me the runaround on money back guarantee, kept referring me to other departments, never received any money back. Have been charging my credit card for monthly fee of $19.95 for 10 months. Cannot get them to respond. Cost me a total of over $1000.00 to this point. Continues to cost me.
The Tax Club sold me a tax accounting package for $1500 and $19 a month that was supposed to give me unlimited access to a licensed CPA that has expertise in my area of business in my state. After joining the Tax Club, I received weekly sales calls by people that called the calls consultations. Each call ended with a hard sell on a different service like bookkeeping, legal documents and other services. Each service would be thousands more. They would tell me that my accountant would be calling me but I have a different meeting scheduled first for some other subject. I would wait for the scheduled call and the call would be another sales call. They kept me on the hook until my right of rescission for getting a refund had expired. I never signed a contract but they say that by logging into their website, I accepted the terms of service. The 2008 VTO was not available on the site and I needed to do my taxes immediately. They would not tell me when the VTO would be available when I asked over email. They continued to keep me on the hook to allow the 30 days to expire. The credit card company attempted to give me my money back but they can only do so much. Since the Tax Club provided terms of service they say I received, they would not reverse the charges. I did not electronically sign anything that I remember and if I did, they failed to deliver on their promises as they gave in their sales call. I have started a class action lawsuit against the Tax Club. This company is also known as the Manhattan Professional Group.
The Tax Club is a fraudulent LLC that promises a wide range of services but never makes good on none of them. Let me say first off that I blame myself partially for not reading these comments first. As a first time business owner I should have been more careful as to whom, especially these crooks, I allow to handle corporation's business. I was contacted about two weeks after setting up my S-corp by Natalie who had great hopes and promises as to our refund and deductions even though we had just started at the end of December. She promised huge refunds, personal CPAs and accountants and help with everything from business plans, constant protection and consultation for our business. None of these things happened. Everything was fraud. And when confronted, they handled it as if I was the problem and they are unaware of their terrible services. Be aware. I am submitting this to my lawyer. Half as refund.
Wow! I almost went for the same ride as others here. I was contacted by The Tax Club shortly after using Legal Zoom to start up my S-Corp. The call was a little too sales pitchy for my tastes and Michael kept repeating key phrases as if he was reading from a cue card. The whole thing reminded me of the movie Boiler Room. After about the fourth time, he told me that they would be Aggressive and even Creative in finding my newly formed S-Corp tax deductions. I told him that I would have to run this all past my current CPA. He scheduled a follow up phone call for two weeks later. Meanwhile, a simple Google search netted me plenty of evidence to convince me that The Tax Club is not for me. I feel sorry for those folks who signed up with these jokers and lost out.
They contacted me because I had started a business. They said they would take care of my business and tax set up. Handled professionally so that I could avoid as much taxes as possible, so I could make sure I was set up correctly (convinced me I needed a S-corp). After the initial $2995, they added $895 for doing my upcoming taxes and after that they scheduled weekly calls to HELP me. These were high pressure sales calls also. When we realized that this was a scam, we demanded money back. They did a partial refund. The end result was after the refunds we still ended up paying almost $1400 for an EIN (that's about 5 minutes worth of paper work). Other than being out the $1400, we also have to start from scratch setting up our business (about 2 months behind schedule). I can't tell you the stress that causes as we can't find out what if anything has been sent to our state government. They have helped push us to the brink of collapse. By the way, the whole time that they are pressuring us into putting more and more on our credit cards they are promising that they will get it all (our business investments) back at the end of the year. I found out recently that is not possible.
They sold us thousands of dollars worth of services using fraudulent statements and these services wre not even needed given the financial situation we were in at the time. Also they took 3 tries at preparing our tax return. We finally took it to a local firm who more than doubled the amount of the refund we are getting compared to what they did. We purchased services we can not pay for based on the lies they told us. If what they had told us had been true we would be able to pay back the debts. We have talked to several lawyers about filing for bankruptcy and our cridt will be ruined.
After speaking with Mr. Seither, who is very good at convincing you that they are the tax experts... I signed up for their membership for $2000. Yes this seemed like a hefty fee... but when comparing their $20 a month fee for unlimited phone calls, and preparation of two tax returns a year, one personal and one business, it made more financial sense in the long run then pain $275 an hour to my current CPA every time I had a question. What I found however is that I know more about taxes than the people that work for the tax club. Their tax planners, their bookkeepers, their corporate executives, etc. all give different answers to the same question... none of them coinciding with what my attorney says. Especially when it comes to forming a business entity. And during each consultation they continually tried to get you to sign-up for more services. One service to form a corporate entity, another for bookkeeping, etc. each one costing $1-$2000. I also found out that I do all the work when preparingt taxes. I have to implement everything into their computer program... I might as well just buy TurboTax. When asking for a refund I am told that I could only get a refund within the first three days and that I am obligated to still pay the $20 a month for year. When I asked to speak to a supervisor, I am put on hold and ignored.
