Had fraudulent transactions on my card. Called as soon as I found out which was the same day and was advised to deactivate current card and get a temporary one in which I did! My remaining funds still haven't been transferred and on top of that no one has even contacted me about the fraudulent charges!! Customer Service is a complete joke and offers no help. All they do is read from a piece of paper.
Don't let H&R Block do your taxes! They have ruined my experience twice by not filing properly. Arbitration was so busy it took them 30 days to contact me back (So I know I'm not the only one). When they called me we got nothing accomplished. I will never use their service again! And I will continue to let my friends, family, co-workers, facebook, twitter, instagram, etc. know they are not who you want to file with. Ever!!!
