I bought this new tv because people made fun of the size of my last tv. All I cared about was it fit in the furniture that I had for hiding my tv. Now my tv sits on top of an antique sideboard so more people notice it. Not being a tv perfectionists, all I wanted was a tv I could easily plug in and operate. This flat screen is lightweight. Every plug is labeled and even I can set up what I need to. The picture is good quality for my tastes and am very happy with my tv. I hope I don't have to buy another the rest of my life which tells you how important all the new "improvements" are to me. I not long ago got rid of a tv that my family had given my grandmother when she went to live in a home in the the 1970's. It was from Montgomery Ward, no remote but was a great little tv. read more hide
My husband bought the TV about 10 years ago. It is a 37-inch JVC Flat screen, our first one of this kind. It works great, has good color, sound, a clear picture. I have 2 other in the house, have replaced them both. The one in my room is still going strong. read more hide

This company offered to help settle our situation with the IRS. We were asked for $1750.00 so they can get started. We provided the money, nothing was ever started. Again we tried calling and calling to no avail. They refused our calls, never called back. Now we are in deeper trouble with the IRS because of being scammed. read more hide
I called First American Tax Relief after hearing an advertisement on local radio station back in September 2013. They said no matter what, my student loan was approved for rehabilitation guaranteed. All I had to pay was $175 a month for 6 months and I would owe $0 on my student loans. So I gave my debit card and authorized through an email. Well, they took $775 and then told me that my loans couldn't be rehabilitated or consolidated. They were sorry, they thought they could help, and mine was the first loan they came across that they couldn't help. I was shocked because they had guaranteed me. I asked for a refund since I only make $8.50 an hour, and that really hurt to pay that every month. Anyway, I was told they couldn't give my money back. That the work that they did cost that much, which was faxing and filling out paperwork. Are you kidding me? I was hurt, betrayed, and shocked. I called them recently to ask again for a refund and they said I waited too long, and because I complained to Better Business Bureau, they can't refund me? What? I've been scammed. Is there anyone out there that can help me get my money back? Thanks. read more hide
I too was taken for over $4500.00 by these so called tax experts. They did absolutely nothing but take our money and ask for personal info and robbed our bank account. Anyone know of a class action suit to join? I feel justice should be served and the people who were scammed should be compensated. We should all be able to get back we deserve. P.S. Still paying to the IRS 7 years later with no end in sight. read more hide

I contacted A.T.R. after receiving five letters from the I.R.S. demanding payment for failure to file. A.T.R. charged me a total of $7,000.00 and negotiated payments to the I.R.S. for almost DOUBLE of what I would have had to pay if I had ignored the I.R.S. all together. A.T.R. failed to deliver on their promises as were stated in their TV ads. Who do I see about getting my money back? LOL. read more hide
I was taken by American Tax Relief. In 2010, I needed help from a lawyer to represent me in tax court. After hearing several radio commercials from ATR, I decided to call them and made an appointment at their office in Beverly Hills, CA. When I arrived I was a little suspicion but did not see the warning signs. It was a big office, around 4000 square feet, but it was almost empty of employees. There were only 2 gentlemen working in the office, without receptionist. The person helping me by the name Paul ** was wearing casual clothes and told me its casual Friday. After looking at my tax return he promised me ATR will reduce my debt from $60,000 to 10% or less without having to go to tax court. "Cool,” I said but first I had to pay $6250.00 and 30 days later, another $6250.00. I said it was too expensive. He said we're not in cheap part of town and I trust the company because they're in Beverly Hills. Unfortunately for me, I started to see the warning signs too late. They asked me to provide all documents showing my properties, home, auto, bank accounts, etc. It has nothing to do with tax court? I did not provide any docs, and when I called to get status of my case they never answer the calls. Instead they keep calling me to request more money. I refused to pay anymore but it was too late. After all I still had the same problem minus $12,500.00. Hope they go to jail. read more hide
They did not help me. When the IRS started taken money out of my pay check, I called IRS to ask if American Tax Relief had notified them on my behalf and IRS told me that they have no document that the American Tax Relief called them. I tried to call American Tax Relief, and no one answered my phone calls. I kept calling every day for a whole week and no one bothered to return my messages. I just want my money back because they did not help me! After a week of phone calls with no answer and a week of messages not returned, then I finally realized I have been had! This makes me real angry at them. Is there someone out there that can help me get my money back? I am in a really bad financial situation! read more hide
I am very angry. They got $4,800.00 of my money and then would not answer the phone. I just settled with the IRS myself and I spoke with someone from the IRS. I need to get more info from them, but we can file a report on them which I intend on doing. read more hide

I contacted American Tax Relief in 2004 .I had $4,500.00 pulled out of my bank account in less than one hour. Within 24 hours they needed $4,500.00 more to send out the complete contract. Within 72 hours they had taken another $4,500.00 from my account without my knowledge and never heard from them again. I called the company over 50 times; they either hung up or put me on hold. They destroyed the financial balance in my family. They not only told us we must sale our home, but we were only able to keep one automobile. They completely destroyed my entire family. We lost our house at a much lesser value. We couldn’t get two cars sold. They were repoed and we had to sale one of our business just to survive. I dislike that company more than you could ever know. They destroyed us financially as if it wasn't already bad enough. read more hide
After seeing their ad on TV and hearing their ads played over and over on the radio, I paid American Tax Relief $5,000 by depositing a cashier's check to their Bank of America account. After that I heard that they were scamming other people. I called Steve ** and Shaun ** who said that they cannot refund my money even if they have not done anything. The Federal Trade Commission shut them down because they are scammers. They collect money from you, without even looking at any of your paperwork. I want to know how I can recover.

In January 2009 I obtained the professional services of American Tax Relief for the purpose of getting help with my tax problems. Instead, I gave them $5,500.00 that I could have used to pay the IRS directly. American Tax Relief is guilty of fraud and taking innocent people's money. On December 3, 2010 I received a letter from the IRS that I was no longer represented by ATR. They (ATR) did not call me to inform me of this and when I tried contacting them, I failed to get a return call. read more hide

In September 2009, I called to get help with taxes and paid $5500.00. In a little over a month, they called back and said that they needed $3900.00 more to put all paper work in place to represent my family. As time went on, we had to send in things to IRS though it was going okay. I started getting letters from IRS again wanting money for back taxes. I’ve tried calling ATR but no call back. Now, I've found out about ATR fraud and am just upset with myself out $9400.00 and don't know how much trouble and worse now than back in September 2009. If there's a group lawsuit, I would like to be added to it. read more hide
I own a restaurant back in 2004 until 2006. I got into a bind with my taxes due to the building that I was renting. It was falling apart and could not get the landlord to fix it up. I was out all sorts of money trying to fix it so that I could keep my business going. After spending just about all the operating expense money, I realized that I could no longer keep this up. I was not able to pay my taxes and I was sending the IRS part of the payments that I could afford. I hired ATR on November 13th 2006 sending them $3900.00. They informed me that this would cover all their work, and that they would do the job right the first time because they did not want to spend their time or money to have to appeal. They keep asking for more information and I keep sending it to them. In 2008, they still had not gotten my taxes taken cared of, and I had to file for bankruptcy in November 2008. I was then told that they could not go any further until the bankruptcy was taken cared of. My bankruptcy did not get dismissed until February 2009. I had since found out that I had cancer and I let ATR know that I was in treatment. I have had three surgeries for my cancer; the last one being in January 2010. ATR was working with me, or so I thought. I got my last letter from them on September 7th 2010 saying that they had a settlement offer for the IRS. I told them to go ahead and send me the letter for offer in compromise so that we could take care of this. I have called them seven times since this letter and faxed them an ok to submit this offer and have not heard from them since. I have not only called Melissa but also the 800 number to which I get a recording and then them telling me that the box is full and I cannot leave a message. I have been fighting for my life the last two years and I have raked up a lot of hospital bills due to my cancer. I thought this was one thing I didn't have to worry about, but on top of cancer, I lost my money that I paid ATR and now the taxes that I owe have doubled. If there is anyone with a lawsuit against them, I would love to be part of it. My taxes have went from owing around $14,000.00 to owning $27,000.00. I have no hope now and not only in a bind to pay my hospital bills but to pay my taxes now. Please, I just need a little help. The IRS has already taken my retirement money that I had and what money I had in the bank account. They have put a lien on my house. read more hide
I hear this advertisement on the radio that they can help you out. I believed it. Boy, was I wrong. They took me for $4900.00. I’m ashamed that I fell for it. They sent me a thing where if I pay $500.00 that it would be settled, but didn’t think I’ll do it because I didn’t think it’s true too. They messed my life up. I had health problems, no nerve shot. Don’t believe, people. I had a seizure, and now can’t drive for two years because of the medicine I take. Why just didn’t I call IRS and set up a payment plan. I got a loan from my dad for the $4900.00. How am I going too deal with that now? read more hide

After seeing the commercials and ads for this company, I called them and they told me that they could prevent the IRS from placing a levy on my bank account for an amount owed to the IRS. I had to pay them $3800 that day. I did. Thirteen days later, the IRS levied my account for the entire amount they said I owed. I called ATR, and asked for my money back and they said no.

I had invested heavily into Boeing right before 9/11. My prayers go out to those lost. Even though I lost everything I invested and then some, I still was sent notification that I was being taxed because at one point my shares were a substantial gain to me. After seeing the commercial for American Tax Relief, I called them up to see what they could do for me. I was told through offer in compromise that they could reduce my 90k that I owed the IRS to only 3 grand, fantastic! The two payments of $7,500 seemed like a steal if they could save me that much money. Steal is right! They wanted all sorts of paper work to aid them in working on my case and they always seemed to need it within the next day. I did my best to make sure that I sent them everything I could in order to make the process go more smoothly. After 3 months and $15,000, there was an unauthorized draft from my bank account for $3,500. I immediately called and asked what this was about. Apparently, the IRS rejected the Offer in Compromise they submitted and needed another $3,500 to ‘re-open’ my case. What?! Do you mind telling me when you are going to draft my account or at least fail at what you were supposed to do?! I thought it was too late. Anyway, so I told them to go ahead and ‘re-open’ my case. After another 3 months of resending all the paperwork that I already sent them, another $1,200 was drafted from my account! What the hell?! How can they just take my money?! How can this company just keep taking my money without my consent?! They have literally stolen $4,700 from me! And the $15,000 they took initially for one didn't get the job done! So after almost $20,000, they have done absolutely nothing! So I called the IRS and they told me that my offer in Compromise was denied in November and no other contact has been had since. November! ATR had taken money, the cost to ‘re-open’ from me in February! They took my money and did…? All my money went to finance their damn commercials so they could scam more people like me! I finally got this issue resolved when I contacted the accounting firm that my brother uses for his corporate accounting. I didn't go to them in the first place because I thought they would be to expensive since they do corporate accounting for billion dollar companies. They charged me literally a fraction of what American Tax Relief did. And reduced my debt to only 8,000! Not an Offer in Compromise like American Tax Relief said, I make too much income to qualify for that. Obviously, why the IRS denied my OIC initially. But they were able to eliminate all of the interest and penalties and had my debt reassessed based on my investment and not on what the Potential Gaines were. They actually have a department for consumers, not just corporate accounting I guess, **** is their number. Talk to Dave, he's the guy who helped me. Does anyone know of how I can get my money back from American Tax Relief? Is there a class action suit I can join. Anything would help. If you are reading this and need tax help, do not use American Tan Relief! They are a complete scam and will steal your money! If you can't do it yourself, check out and settle with their dot info. That's the firm I used. That's their site for regular consumers who have tax problems. I knew American Tax Relief had a few complaints but I thought it was a number thing. Disney Land has complaints, etcetera. But American Tax Relief doesn't even know how to help you! It seems like they tell everyone that they're entitled to an offer in compromise, complete lies! On the IRS site, they even state that over 90% of OICs are denied! I should have listened to my brother in the first place. read more hide
Boy did I dodge a bullet! When I called these guys up, it was a strong arm sale from the very beginning. I guy named Joseph **i or something gave me the run down. What I owe, how much I make, my assets etc. Next question was "Would you like to write a check by phone or use a credit card? That will be $7,500." Under what circumstance would somebody hand over that amount of hard earned money after a 10 minute conversation? Well not me. I kinda laughed, and asked if that is normal protocol. He exclaimed that because they are such a big company and spend a million dollars in advertising every month, I should have a blind faith in them. Needless to say I did not hand over the money. About a month later, after networking with a few friends. I was pointed to the website settle with the IRS dot info, 877 - 517 -0067. My experience with them has been as smooth as one could expect from a professional company. I've had a great experience with a man named Owen. Helpful from Start to finish. They performed a tax investigation before quoting me on what they could do. This only made sense to me because if I don't have a clue what my situation is with the IRS, then how could I expect this company to know what they could do for me and require an upfront exorbitant amount of money to find out where I stand? Last but not least, I saved a lot more than what American Tax Relief was going to require upfront. read more hide
I am so ** at this company for taking my money like they did. I told him before we draft anything from my account that I wanted to see what they can do first. So, I sent in a post dated check to them. Somehow the pricks got around the post dated check and still drafted my account. So now I'm ** that I'm out of $1275 and can’t get it back. None of the garnishments stopped and there also was a lien placed on my house. I was fed up with this sorry bunch of ** over hear at this American Tax Relief. What a joke! So, I did some more soul searching and found a firm in Newport Beach California. I went online and the name of the firm was settled with the IRS info. The young man I spoke to was very helpful. He did tell me that since I did sign a power of attorney, the other firm will no longer be able to represent me any longer. Also, within 48-72 hours after he looked into my situation, the lien was lifted off my home and also my total debt was reduced to almost nothing. I just completed my program with them on July 20, 2010. And I'm very happy to have run across this firm. I know the number is 877-517-0067 and Dennis is whom I spoke to, or really anyone there can help you. But that's the young man I talked to. They have very friendly service and you get good results, and also no high ** upfront fees. I did lose money with American Tax Relief, and I can’t get that back. I wish I could. I just don't know what else to do. If anyone has any solution to that, please let me know. read more hide
These commercials make me sick. You think maybe this is one reason our country is in the state it is in? Our country has the lowest tax rate in the world. People should appreciate this and fulfill their obligations to their government. I know that there is misappropriations of government funds, but it is just as bad when we don't expect to be accountable enough to pay our own way. As long as we don't, scams like this will always succeed. read more hide
My checking account was levied for every single penny back in October, 2009. I saw an ad for ATR and called them. I was told that of the 17k I owed in federal tax, I would only have to pay about a third of that and that ATR would reduce all but my original tax; all late fees, penalties, and interest would be eliminated. I paid them $3,800 via cc over the phone and then sent them all of my outstanding tax information. I was told that my levied checking account funds would be returned (5k) and that they would take care of me. I received an information request package from ATR and was told to submit within 30 days. I completed the forms and faxed the data in promptly. I heard nothing. Two months later, I had my checking account levied again from the IRS! I contacted ATR and was told that they never received my information and sent letters requesting it but that I did not send the information in; completely not true (I have a fax receipt to prove it!). I ended up dealing with the IRS directly and ATR did nothing to help me! After I settled with the IRS, I contacted ATR and asked for my money back; they refused. When I spoke with Paul **, he told me they would not refund my money and that I was to blame for ATR not performing any work. When I asked for my money back, he literally laughed at me and told me "good luck with that." I asked for his supervisor’s name, and he laughed again and asked, "Who do you report to, huh? I report to no one but me." I then asked who the owner of the company was and he said, "Why don't you look that one up." ATR should be stopped! I am mystified as to why the authorities allow this "enterprise" to go on. They are predatory and deceptive. I want my money back ATR! I was told by an atty. to file a claim with the AG of California and to sue them. Sue them I will and I will blog all over the internet until I get my money back from these **. Do not use American Tax Relief! You can deal with the IRS yourself and save yourself a lot of money and aggravation. Not only did I lose the $3,800 I paid American Tax Relief, I lost time and opportunity with the IRS while I waited for ATR to do their job!

I had fallen and the caretaker threw out my records for 2005 and I had no income information. The CPA did not tell me I could get the info from IRS so taxes didn't get filed. I sent him info to file in 2006 and 2007 but he only file for extensions. Then I got the information from IR to file the 2005 return and sent that to him. He filed all three years in 2008. I contacted American Tax Relief and they charged me $5500 to handle it. I sent them bunches of info and then the owner called me and said that I needed to pay another $5500 because I misinformed them. Not true! They did nothing for me and IR levied my bank account. My husband was in a nursing home at that time and passed away in 2009. I contacted IRS myself and they have marked the account uncollectable and told me I would have done better to have contacted them myself in the beginning. There is $500 in my account being held by IRS and due to my husband's death I have very little income now. I am 75 and crippled. My grandson gave me money to bury my husband and IRS took that but gave back most of it. IRS says I owe something like $78900. I will not have that much during the rest of my life.

My husband initiated the call with ATR, and then referred them to me as I would be handling the case. The guy I talked to was very unprofessional and couldn't understand why I needed to read over the information he sent. He just wanted me to sign. When I informed him that I wanted to discuss the matter with my husband (my husband is working out of state) he told me I was going to "muck" this up for him. I told him I am just being cautious. After much discussion my husband and I decided not to use their services, so I called to inform Eric that we were not going to require their services at this time. He told me I neeeded to loosen up and basically tried to argue with me. At that point I stated again we didn't need their services and his statement to me was "Thank God!"

called american tax relief in sept of 07. before i got off phone i was pressured into a power of attorny which they used to charge me $5000.00 which was taken straight out of my bank account for their services. i was asked to supply information for the case to send to the irs which i did provide. 2 weeks later i was informed that they needed more information and it had to be at their offices within 2 days or they would drop my case. this was on a friday. i could not get all the info they requested by monday but i sent what i had. that monday another $5000.00 was withdrawn from my account with out my consent because the info was not complete and they dropped my case. when i asked about the withdrawal i was told that they were continuing my case and that the second $5000.00 was used to reopen the case. within 1 month i was asked to provide info that they had already recieved. i called and told them that they already had the info and asked what the problem was. i was told that the irs rejected the info that i had sent and they told me that i needed to send the same info again or they would drop my case. again i was given very short notice to get them the info or they would drop my case and charge me another $2000.00 to reopen my case for the third time. i was told to have the info to them by april 20 2009. i faxed the info on april 19 which was a sunday. monday the $2000.00 was withdrawn from my account again without my knowledge. when i called and asked what was going on i was informed that the info i sent to them was not complete and the $2000.00 was to continue the case. on may 8 2009 i recieved a letteer from the irs that my offer and compromise was denied because they had not recieved all the info they had requested. again i called american tax relief and asked what was going on. i was told that they did not understand why the irs agent they were working with would not accept the info that had been sent. american tax relief said they would appeal the case in " a month or two and try to get a different irs agent to take the case". on sept. 16 2009 i recieved a letter from the irs stating that american tax relief had dropped my case as of aug.24 2009. i have recieved nothing from american tax relief since i called them in may so it was quite the surprise letter from the irs. in my opinion american tax relief makes sure that you cannot possiblly get the info to them on time and if you do they will find more info that is needed. this is a scam. i would have been better off sending the money to the irs. american tax relief basically charged me $12000.00 for nothing. they are crooks read more hide
I was making general calls on 09/08/09 to Tax Lawyers to find an appropriate company that I feel comfortable with. American Tax Relief was the first company I contacted to discuss my back-tax issue owed to see what I can do to reduce the total amount due. I spoke with P. Franklin and let him know my situation. During our discussion, I gave information that Mr. Franklin said was needed to continue our conversation and one information was who I banked with. We went back and forth with questions and information in our discussion which one discussion was estimated cost of service and Mr. Franklin said $12,000.00 I said I can't afford that then he talked to the accounting department and said they can take $3,000.00 a week and I said I can't afford that. Then he said he is going to fax me information, so I gave Mr. Franklin my fax number. I was not in the office when I was talking to Mr. Franklin and when I came back to the office the fax was an application. I started looking-up American Tax Relief and other tax lawyers online and saw a tremendous amount of complaints on ATR which of course I did not persue their services. No agreement was made, no contract was signed, nothing further then a person calling around for a tenttiave service of a company in which I will select. That same day (09/08/09) American Tax Relief automatically took-out $3,000.00 from my bank account and cleared the next day. On 09/11/09, I checked my bank account and found out ATR took out $3,000.00. I called my bank to file fraude and to get my money back because I did not make any deal or contract with this company. All I did was call to get information. I called ATF and said what's going on and they gave me a bunch of [lies] that our conversation was signing-up so I just hung-up so I can waste my time trying to get my money back and going after American Tax Relief. AMERICAN TAX RELIEF TOOK $3,000.00 FROM MY BANK FOR JUST MAKING A 1 TIME CALL TO ASK WHAT TYPE OF SERVICES THEY PROVIDED WHICH LED TO ME HAVING $3,000.00 STOLEN FROM ME, CLOSING MY BANK ACCOUNT, FILING FRAUDE, WORKING TO GET MY MONEY BACK, AND MORE TROUBLE THEN I NEED TO WASTE MORE OF MY TIME. read more hide
I consulted with ATR in Jan '08. I divored in late '06 and when filing my taxes for that year, I owed over 25K to the IRS. After consulting with an ATR representative explaining that I had recently lost my son due to an accidental drowning, my company sold out and I lost my job and I got a divorce all within a nine month period, he said I definitely qualified for the tax relief. I was eager to pay the fee of 3800.00 knowing that ATR could reduce my tax obligation to 6,000.00 or less. About a month later, I receive a letter saying I was not qualified. Bottom line, I gave them 3800.00 for nothing and eventually had to file bankruptcy for the first time in my life. ATR in my opinion represents American Tax Rip-off, rather than relief. I don't expect anything from this as I have considered this a hard lesson learned. I just hope others will search the internet before they contract with this company. read more hide
After seeing an advertisement on television I opted to call and find out more about the program being offered for settling outstanding IRS tax debt. I called the number which also gave a website irstaxagreements and I received an agent who didn't give his name, but proceeded to give me the information that I requested. He explained how the program worked and then said in order to determine if I qualified he would need to ask me some questions from an IRS survey in order to tell me exactly how he could help me. Throughout the discussion he kept claiming to be a member of a group of attorneys, however when I asked how much would the program cost he said $6,900 and I immediately told him that I wouldn't even try to afford that. He began to push for me to use a credit card or post-dated check and I said "No Thanks" and he pushed harder and then I decided to hang up. Well he called right back and began to tell me that I was acting like a child and was less than a human being who was stupid. At this point I just told him that I would contact the BBB and the IRS to file a complaint and he said "You can file a complaint against an attorney who is trying to help you" so I proceeded to hung up on him and have not heard from them since. read more hide
July 7 my husband contacted Amer Tax Relief and spoke w/ Chris Hanna for information on how their company could help reduce the amount we owed the IRS. My husband called me at my office to tell me everything that was said and wanted to know what I thought. Mr. Hanna was wanting my work fax to fax over paperwork for me to sign over power of atty and fill in personal information, etc. From the facts give and the extent of the information they wanted I refused and told my husband to call them back and tell them we would not be using their services. Mr. Hanna was suppose to be waiting for his call. Unfortunately my husband had given Hanna our bank acct number and during the 15 mins. between phone calls (15 mins.) he had ran through 3900.00. We did not find out till later that this had happened. We had already paid the IRS what we owed them and shortely afterwards received a letter from Amer Tax Relief welcoming us as clients and for $3900.00. We called the next morning and spoke to Mr. Hanna asking him why he ran it through w/out authorization (since he was waiting on my ok.). He told us that my husband is a liar, weasel, less of a man, etc. and that he never called back to decline. (I knew was false since my husband kept notes on the conversation and I had called him to check to see if he called and what was said by Mr. Hanna.) We were told we would not be getting our money back. No refunds. He said the letter stated that we had 5 days to decline in writing their services. However we recevied the letter way beyond the 5 days. At this point I have contacted the FBI., US Atty's Office, Sheriff's Dept., the Nat'l radio station that I heard the advertisement on, next will be the Atty. General's Office. The FBI is investigating, as well as the other agencies. The radio station wants to use our story. Please everyone else should contact their local FBI Office and start an investigation and call where ever they heard the advertisment. This is a federal offense and these people need to be put away. I have never in my life been talked to the way Chris Hanna spoke to us. For the $3900.00 they were not hired, did nothing and we had already paid the IRS. Our bank is giving us a line of credit for this amount till their investigation is done. When I called the bank they had already read the disputes on the internet and will be presuing collection as well. Let's not sit still till they are behind Federal bars!!!! read more hide

Two & half years ago I contacted ATR after hearing one of their ad's. I was told no problem just send them $ 3,900.00 & they could help me. Wells they contacted me yesterday after a conference call with the IRS Appeals Agent to let me no I would have to pay the full amount due. The only thing they help me do is increase the amount I owed in interest & penalties. I fell total ripped off. I do not understand how they can make the boggus claims they make. read more hide
I just called American Tax Relief this morning after hearing the ads on XM/Sirius Radio. Within the first few moments, he collected my name, my spouse's name (filing information) and the amount in back taxes owed. He then said I would be forwarded to an interview to assess if they could help. I told him that I wanted to understand what they offered before I proceed with an interview. The line went dead. I called back on another line and got the same agent. I told him that we must have gotten disconnected. He said that he hung up on me. I asked why. He said that it is a Monday morning and he is too busy to work with me if I am not ready to proceed. Impact: it led me to this site and the horrific experiences that you people have endured. As a result, I feel very blessed that I dodged the bullet. read more hide

American Tax Relief is a fraudulant organization. I contacted them about a tax liability and they were confident that they could resolve my issues with a low interest payment plan. They used scare tactics to get me to employ their services by making statements about the IRS that made it sound like I was in imminent danger of losing everything. I paid them $3,900.00 to begin work on my case. This was to be an all-encompassing all-inclusive flat rate to bring my case to resolution. I was told that a late fee would be applied if I did not return a questionarrie to them within 30 days, but I was not told how much the fee would be (more on that later). A huge packet of questions arrived which took me two weeks to compile answers and photocopy volumes of bank statements and other financial information requested by them. The packet was mailed back to them by certified mail, and arrived a day over the 30 day mark. Again, there was literally no way to comply with the deadline since the information requested was so huge. The week following delivery of my financial packet, I was contacted by Mr. Franklin who informed me that because the 30 day time expired, additional fees would be required. The additional fee would be $3,100.00. I was very suspicious at that time, since I was being asked for a total of $7,000.00 and no work had been performed on my case yet. SInce my IRS debt was not that high, I began to realize that this was a scam operation to milk money out of unsuspecting consumers. The tactic used is to get you to buy in a large amount of money, then you feel like you have to keep paying or you would lose everything you have already invested in their (non) work. I told Mr. Franklin that the late fee was outrageously high and there was no valid explanation for what work would be performed for that fee. I asked if I could a legal representative come to the office and meet with them in person to regain the confidence I had lost in such a surprising and shockingly high late fee. My representative presented to the address listed above, and was not allowed to meet with any staff, being told that they were on the phone for hours with the IRS. How convenient. The $3,100.oo fee was attempted to be negotiated down to 1,900, then 1,550 in a typical sales tactic to keep me as a customer. The fact that the late fee was so negotiable actually confirmed my suspicions that the whole situation was a scam. I told both Mr. Franklin and Mr. Davis that I would not be needeing their services any more, and I would prefer that my own attorney handle things from now on. I got a very long sales pitch. The final blow (as of this date) is that American Tax Relief tried to deduct $1,550.00 from my checking account the same day they were terminated. Again, this organization is nothing more than a scam to extract cash from vulnerable individuals; they have no intention of helping anybody and freely attempt to help them selves to your accounts. Anyone doing caught in the scam should check their accounts frequently to catch unauthorized withdrawals. read more hide
In December of 2008 I spoke to R. Campbell at American Tax Releif who stated that they were able to help me with reducing my business taxes of 2007 and 2008. I had to pay $5500 up front. They worked on the taxes for a few months requireing tax information one after another. Finally I got supsious after a phone call from C. Hanna who cliamed that they could settle with the Irs for less than the original arrangement. However, he was requesting $3900.00 more in payment to the company. I refused to go along without some proof of what waw orinally was to be settle. So I contacted the Irs to find out if a settlement had been made with the and they stated no. At this point i got even more suspious, then went to my bank the next day to make a bank deposit to find out that even though i didnot agree to the new agreement Chris Hanna and Atr fraudley withdrawn $1950.00 from my account using their own check with a fake account number with a stamp on saying no signiture was reequired for the bank to honor this check. When i call ATR to speak with the supervior P. Franklin and C. Hanna they state that they had a right to do this and that i should be glad that they could reduce the payment for less. They rude and threaten to discontine my case no matter what i paid them and i would not be getting my money back. So i went to my bank and closed the account and put in a fraud claim against the company and their check was stopped. Now i a seeking legal assistance retain my $5500.00 back for unfinsh work and reporting them to the federal trade commission. I try to call back to Atr to inform them of my actions and that my lawyer would be calling them. After that they are refusing my calls. read more hide

I paid the intial fee of $5,700 to start their services to have my tax debt reduced. I agreed to make 6 on time payments and then the company was suppose to have my debt reduced. I have made 9 payments, the company will not return my phone calls or give me a resolution. My 2008 tax return was issued to pay off my 2007 debt balance, the company never told me this. I have already lost $21,090 and I am still make payments, which is a lot more then I originally owed in ym 2007 tax return debt. I would like retribution and have the money that is owed to me. I lost my 2008 tax return due to this mishap, they have been dishonest and I feel like they scammed me into having them reduce my debt when I have already paid a lot more then I owed originally. I have had economic troubles, I am now living paycheck to paycheck since I am still making almost $600 a month payments plus losing my 2008 tax return of roughly $10,500. I should not have to kee making payments, the agreement was make 6 and then they would tell me my reduced debt and I would pay the remaining in bulk. read more hide
On or about June or July of 2004 I called A.T.R. to talk about my tax debt and Mr. M told me every thing I wanted to here. I was about to loose my house and was so glad that my tax problem could be solved and all I had to do was give him 3,100.00 dollars so he took that from my ck. acc. and that where my troubles started he sent some papers to me and thats about all that happened I would call and he would never be there so one time I blocked my # and called and he answered the phone.

We hired them to help with a tax issue,after a failed business due to the economy in Michigan. I saw a television advert for American Tax Relief. they charged us $4000 up front and did absolutely nothing. I sent them everything they requested but they lost it all when they moved offices, so I had to spend a fortune again copying and posting another box of documents to them. They are to stop interest and penalties asap while they worked on our negotiations with the IRS. They did NOT! No one is ever available to answer the phone, you can leave messages till your blue in the face and no one ever returns your calls. On the rare occasion you do get through, they have an excuse for everything, which always has to do with a mistake on your part, not theirs. After 4 years of this they had the nerve to ask for $4000 more to finish. I told them to &^#%*@ OFF! I now owe tons more than I did to start with as 4 more years of interest and penalties have accrued, All my accounts have been frozen and I face financial ruin! read more hide
In April faced with a large tax debt to the IRS and State and no job. I was living off of my 401k plan to make my house payments and feed myself, daughter & grand-daughter. I made the biggest mistake of my life and seen the ad on tv from one of the worst companies on the face of the earth and made a call to them asking what they can do for me, to make a long story short. Sean guaranteed me that they could eliminate all but 3 - 4 thousand dollars of my tax debt if I paid them $5,900.00 well, I did and after that it was next to impossible to get a hold of them and when I did get a hold of them they would run me in circles giving me every excuse in the world as to why things are not settled yet. Then one day out of the blue I get a letter from the IRS saying they have set up a payment plan for which I am too pay them monthly, probably for the rest of my life. I then called ATR to find out what was going on and they told me that they set up a payment plan for me. When I told him that this is not what you said you were going to do for me he said that once I have paid off a substantial amount of the debt they would pursue abatement of the penalty and interest. This company is nothing more than a bunch of illegal crooks preying on good honest people who found them selves in trouble. I will be filing a lawsuit against them in Los Angeles County Court this coming month 03/2009 as I hope to have the approx. $200.00 need to file the case so I can try and recoup my money, But, probably I am going to be spending more money on a dead horse. If there is anyone else that would like to join me in this lawsuit maybe we can make it a class action lawsuit and put these scum bags out of business permanently and possibly any other firms like this one. although I am fairly certain now that there could not be any other company as scummy as this one!! How does a company like this stay in business as long as they have? Why doesn't the State shut them down? And, Why doesn't the Federal government and/or State put this scum bags in jail where they belong. I want my money back please if there is anyone out there that can help me please call me. read more hide

May husband passed away suddenly in November 2008. I contacted American Tax Relief on 1/7/09 after finding evidence that my husband had not filed some of his tax returns. Since he was coming out of backruptcy after a previous marriage, we filed separate returns. I spoke with Chris H or ATR who promised they could resolve my husband's tax situation. I paid $8500 through a bank draft but never received any disclosure forms. I kept calling Mr. H and asking for some paperwork or documentation. On 1/28/09, I asked for a refund only to be told that they did not give refunds. He then proceeded to tell me how he was trying to be nice about it and that he needed and additional $21,000 for attorney fees since my husband owed $400,000. I told him that I did not have any more money and that I was not responsible for my husband's tax burden before we were married and that I believed the burden to be excessive. Mr. H kept saying that the paperwork was in the mail and that if I contacted the IRS the amount would be larger. To this day I still have not received any disclosure forms, contract or anything in writing stating that they do not give refunds, or exactly what their services cover. I believe ATR preyed on me because of my vulnerability after losing my husband of only 6 years. They should be sued and made to repay each client WITH interest. Losing my husband has been tough enough without having to deal with ATR representatives who are nothing more than crooks. Since I'm out of $8500, I have no funds to pay the IRS. I could have given that amount to the IRS. I have spoken with the IRS and my tax burden should be much less than the $400,000 that ATR quoted. read more hide
On November 8, 2007 I made one of the biggest mistakes of my life. I talked with Chris H from American Tax Relief (ATR). I had a significant tax issue that I couldnt solve myself. I fell for the ads that American Tax Relief has on TV and called them. Chris informed me that ATR could solve the issue for pennies on the dollar. He said all I had to do was send him $12,500 and ATR would take care of the rest. Just two months later without any correspondence in between Chris called me to inform me ATR needed another $8,500 to upgrade their service. Then just one month later Chris called again and claimed another $8,500 was needed to once again upgrade their service. Again there had been no other correspondence in between the requests. I was desperate and still believed his promises so I paid the additional amount. Fast forward to today. ATR has had exactly one meeting with the IRS on my behalf and they botched that one. In working with Melissa I supplied her every document she needed for the meeting. During the meeting ATR was advised that there were other filings that I needed to have completed so I was put into a non-compliant status. ATR didnt advise me of that either because they didnt know or they wanted to upgrade their service again. I didnt give them a chance because I fired them yesterday. Perhaps you can add my letter to the voluminous stack you already have on ATR. Maybe someday they will be held accountable for their actions. read more hide
I own and manage a small business, and interact with the public on a daily basis. I thought I'd dealt with some low life's, but these guys are without question the worst group of schiester rip-off's that I've ever had to deal with. Some months ago, I contacted ATR about pending issues with the IRS, and explained IN FULL DETAIL my situation. The 'sales' agent (Robert) told me that this would not be an issue - that they would take care of my situation and would most likely be able to handle it in entirety. He went to great lengths to promise that it would NOT be an issue, that they in fact WOULD be able to get my fines reduced/eliminated, and that if that were NOT to happen (and if they couldn't help me), they would close out and not charge me full rate ($8500).. I gave them a credit card for the first half of the charge ($4250.00), on the agreement that they would charge this, contact the IRS, and determine what they could. They were to also immediately mail me a set of papers and documents, which I would need to fill out. After 10 days and 2 phone calls I never received these papers. Now, my situation was quite urgent, as I had communicated. In fact after 3 days I called in to find out why I hadn't heard. After 14 days still no papers. I needed some action with the IRS, as I was under threat by a lawyer. 2 further calls. no paperwork. No return phone calls. AFTER FOUR WEEKS, I had my CPA represent me to the IRS and moved forward. I called ATR,got more run-around. Was told they were i motion. When I told them I was cancelling the transaction,I was told that was not possible,as I was contracted and couldn't cancel. They then began calling me repeatedly. Robert and another agent (don't remember off the top of my head) told me I had lied to them, that I hadn't disclosed my situation, made threats against me (that my supposed misrepresentation was illegal, blah blah blah), and that I wouldn't get any refund and no furter help from them. Fortunately I hadn't wired the funds (as they had originally demanded!), but had a credit card company pay them (note only the first half was paid). several days ago I checked my credit card account. Guess what - - these guys had charged me (WITHOUT AGREEMENT ON MY BEHALF) another $4250.00. FURTHERMORE, My credit card has had 2 more unauthorized charges in the past 4 weeks. (please note that this card has NOT been used for ANY OTHER online or phone purchase in 3 years, nor have I ever had unauthorized charges in this time!) My credit card company is investigating this currently. Meanwhile..... I faxed the company this morning, with a note reiterating two things from my prior phone conversation: 1. any further contact is unathorized, not allowed, they do NOT represent me at all to ANYONE, and 2. do not contact me except by fax or mail (do NOT phone me again). Guess what. these clowns called me ON MY CELL PHONE not 5 minutes after getting the fax. I do believe that is a felony. I didn't answer my cell phone, but Robert left me a nice voicemail.. Then after 3 minutes, he called me at my office. I had the forethought to record that conversation, during which he agreed that he KNEW I had legally warned him not to contact me again, and that he did so anyway. He then continued to attempt to coerce me over the charges, claiming I had received paperwork from them, that I was negligent, and supposedly I was somehow legally to blame for this, and that I still owed them even more funds! I am out of a lot of time dealing with these guys, and quite possibly I may be in deep water with the IRS, due to their negligence. There is not a chance in hell I would recommend these clowns to anyone. read more hide

I owed $35K in back taxes. Chris from ATM sent papers only after securing $5500 from me. I have had nothing done, I had to fill out all the paperwork do the chasing around and then have received two threatening letters saying I should have sent this or that. Meanwhile I now have a deadline to get two turndowns from mortgage companies and pay my debt down to 25K Meanwhile my tax bill is now $69K. I left 10 messages for Chris who didn't call back of course. When I finally reached him-he asked me for $3900 more. FOr what? I called the IRS and told them I was trying to get a mortage to pay them. Unfortunately I don't have a mortage so IRS would grab my home in a heart beat. I would love to get a refund but after reading your other complaints about this company I sure wish I had never called. THe IRS is much nicer than American Tax Relief. I have been so stressed over this, The IRS is threatening to take my pension & SSDI and put a lien on my property. Yes they have put me through more stress than the IRS

My husband and I hired American Tax Relief to settle our taxes owed to the IRS. They promised me the world. They said they knew what they were doing and there would be no problem in getting the IRS to accept $6000 (pennies on the dollar they advertise). With the penalties and interest, we owed $23000. I paid them and filled out all the forms and the IRS said no to the offer of compromise. American Tax Relief came up with the $6000 figure, not us. My husband gets paid hourly and he had two good years and American Tax Relief said the IRS would not consider a 40 hr week - they will only look at the two year average. This was in 2004!!! Today I owe over $40,000. American Tax Relief has done nothing to help us. In fact, they have made it worse. I have requested my money back several times. They don't return phone calls, they might respond to you in writing if you are lucky. I have gone to a local attorney and am finally getting the help we need. The local attorney didn't cost me what American Tax Relief charged me! I am going to report this company to the Better Business Bureau and any other Bureau I can find. Never - Never listen to the ads! This was a hard lesson to learn and live through.
I paid them $5500.00 to help me fix my back due taxes. I finally got a response back from the IRS and I owe them more than before. So American Tax Relief did nothing and took my money.
In huge IRS debt and saw the TV commercial. Called and when you are desperate and afraid, I guess common sense goes out the window. Retainer fee to be $12,500 (Apparently fees based on how much you owe... more IRS debt, means you are more scared, and that much more susceptible to being talked into higher fees, which seem like nothing compared to IRS debt...) Since only had room on credit card of $6k, they agreed to take that, that day and balance on end of month 9/30/08. Have never spoken to or received any advice and/or consultation from their staff attorneys and/or enrolled agents. Only communications were from their sales consultants who would call w/a friendly premise but always turned conversation to when could they expect to get the $6500 balance, 'could they get another credit card to run it through on?'. I would point out that due on 9/30, and ask about my case, but always conversation went back to the balance due. Original sales guy was David, but on Friday, 9/26/08, someone named John called. Said he was David's partner so naturally I asked about my case. It quickly became apparent that the point of his call was collection of $6500 only using very strong-arm, collection agency type tactics. Escalated to where he was simply rude and I was not going to get any where w/him in civil manner, so I hung up. No call back from him to apologize or smooth out misunderstanding. Since this occured end of business day Friday, around 5:30 pm, over the weekend I faxed them a notice of my wish to discontinue our relationship, since no real activity performed on my behalf by them I requested a refund of the $6k already paid, and most importantly I revoked any POAs and credit card authorizations previously given. Faxed it down (hard copy via USPS this morning certified), because I wanted to give them written notice....but of course first thing this morning they have already drafted an additional $6500 from my credit account (today is 9/29/08, agreement calls for it to be drafted on 9/30/98). Called them to drop charges and was told that it is non-refundable, which is ridiculous since I have received no service, was cancelling anyway, and in writing they were expressly told that they were not authorized to draft monies from any of my accounts. Needless to say, I have posted a complaint on Los Angeles County Better Business Bureau, (where by the way they have an F rating...wish I had checked prior to...water under the bridge...). I am putting out fraud alert on my credit accounts (they have too much info about me...scary). I will file a small claims for the initial $6k. I am filing a complaint w/the Los Angeles county District Attorney's office Consumer Complaint Division. Well, unless ATR agrees to refund my money, I am out $12,500. Plus the time and additional stress it is taking to get my money back.
i paid them almost 2 thousand dollars for them to get us a tax settlement with the irs & they did nothing except want more money so they could continue or case. so i called the irs myself & got more satisfaction from them, than i did atr.
I hired Amer. Tax Relief in March of 2007 to negotiate a settlement on my behalf, re: my Ga. St. Sales taxes. They promised abatement of penalties, to petition for removal of interest, promised a feasible re-payment plan, etc... I was advised once I hired them to make no tax payments and not to deal with the Revenue dept. myself, to let ATR handle everything. I paid ATR $3950, they took my money and they've done NOTHING on my behalf, in fact, they've made matters worse. As a direct result, I now owe 2x the original amount and it just continues to increase. Additionally, a lien as been levied and the state is threatening to sieze my accounts and close my business. I gave Amer. Tax Relief the last of my money and now I'm up against a wall with no hope of ever being able to pay the ridiculous amount now owed. The increased mental stress has been almost unbearable and has caused physical deterioration as well, resulting in medical bills at a time that I can't afford any medical insurance. Please help.
In March 2008, I hired American Tax Relief to help settle my tax debt. In the beginning, they came across as the answer to my prayer. I told Paul Franklin the details of my situation, what the government said I owed and what my tax returns said I owed. I also told them that I'd originally hired JK Harris to file my taxes and that they had been unable to get anything right the three times they'd prepared my taxes and that I'd eventually done them myself. Since I was let go from my job in 2004 and had not worked a day since, I was assured by Paul Franklin my Tax Consultant that they would be able to settle my taxes for $2,000 to $3,000 dollars after I paid them the $4,900 dollar fee. I told them that I didn't have any money that I lived with my boyfriend and that he paid all the bills now. Long story short, my boyfriend agreed to pay the money to hire them. I returned all their paperwork on May 15th. They had already recieved their final $2450 payment on May 9th. After that, I heard nothing from them until I contacted them on June 30th to ask what the status of the claim was. They assigned me to a Gabriella who seemed like she wanted to work with me when I was talking with her...she just needed to run some things by her supervisor. But...the next phone call I got was from my tax consultant Paul trying to scare me and strong arm me into paying another $3900 for them to complete the process. Seems rather than speak with her supervisor like she said, they were just looking for a way to bilk more money out of me with scare tactics. I told him I'd been speaking with the IRS because I had some questions regarding my daughters fiancial aid and this man had the nerve to yell at me like I somehow answered to him. Then when I told him that I didn't like his scare tactics, he told me I should be scared seeing that I owed the governement $60K according to their calculations. This company is scarier to deal with than the IRS themselves. At least with the IRS, they speak to you with respect. My boyfirend and I are now out $4900 dollars with nothing to show for it. I would like to get the $4900 dollars back as nothing was as they promised unless I can come up with another $3900 dollars which could actually be my tax settlement since there is a formula that the government works off of for an offer-in-compromise.
My wife and I owe $41,000 to the IRS. We had contacted ATR for help, since the IRS didn't want to work with us. I took out a 401K loan in the amount of $5,500.00 for ATR to take our case. Now, after two years nothing was done, just a lot of paperwork back and forth. Nothing was resolved, since my wife and I make too much income for an Offer in Compromise. Now the IRS has levied my paycheck and will leave us pennyless. My wife is on disability and I don't know how we are going to afford her medical bills now.
In early July 2008 I spoke with Robert Campbell about some tax issues I was having. I then asked for a cost estimate for his firm, American Tax Relief, to work on this problem for me. Before he would give me a cost estimate he insisted on getting my bank information. I tried twice to avoid this but finally succumbed. Once he gave me the cost estimate I said that I could not afford that figure and thought the matter was closed. In a few days a package of forms and a cover letter arrived from American Tax Relief. The cover letter very clearly said that the first step was to complete the enclosed powers of attorney for the IRS and a survey form which was also enclosed. Since I had no plans to do business with ATR I simply ignored the paperwork. I was shocked when, on August 4, 2008, ATR emptied my bank account by executing a withdrawal of $1950.
I spoke to Robert Cambell and he was agressive threatening and tryied to take money out of my checking account without my permission. THEY ARE down right extortionist. I want to let the feds know that these so called lawyers are bilking thousands of money from hard working TAX PAYIERS He didnt care if i made payroll or had any money left in my account
June 26, 2008 we signed a contract with David Bradley stating that he would be the power of attorney to get all the tax information from 2000-2008. We gave him $5,900 to do both fed. and state and he said we would only owe the IRS $1,000- $2,000. After we gave him the money we received a phone call from a man named John Buckner yelling at us saying that they need more money ($3,100) in 2 hours or they were going to drop us. At that time we knew it was a scam and they were taking us for a ride. We were stuck and they had all our money. They are the most ignorant people I have ever met. I don't know how they can sleep at night. I would never do business with them and I just want everybody to know to stay away from those people! They had taken money out of my bank account without my permission and after doing that they wanted more. After giving them all of our personal info. John Buckner said he was dropping us.
During my initial call will ATR, the representative was initially polite and seemingly helpful, however, he pushed for more and more personal information including name, address, Social Security Numbers, and then wanted 3900.00 upfront by check over the phone to take our case. I asked Shawn to let me read over the paperwork he was supposed to be faxing, research the company, and discuss the service with my husband and I would call him back. He became irate and insulting. I had to hang up on him. Apparently he knew my research would uncover numerous complaints regarding their rude, bullying tactics. I am now establishing fraud alerts with the credit bureaus for our protection against ATR becasue I gave them our SSN
This is an addition to the report posted. Now, on June 6 I received a letter from my credit card company saying they were unable to process the credit. When I initially talked to American Tax, I provided my credit card over the phone. I was to sign and return documents that were faxed to me but I changed my mind, advised them by fax within a day and did not sign any documents. They did not provide any service to me as we terminated before we even started. Sounds to me like my credit card company and American Tax are in bed together. I'm out $2450 at this point. This is after American Tax agreed to a refund over the phone with the credit card representative on a conferfence call.
my husband contacted atr in april 2008 to help him straighten out a big delinquent tax problem and paid them 3,900.00. on april 17, 2008. on 6/4/2008 a chris hannah called and stated he had let an arbitary deadline go by and demaned another 3,100. they did absoloutely nothing but use strongarm and scare tactics. questioned our character and yelled. i am interested in any way shape or form to sue these people to recover the 3,900.00 and to shed light on this company! i did not have the 3,900.00 to begin with. that put us in a financial bind and now their threats to sue us over the 3,100.00 as being a bad check has me constantly worried and feeling helpless that they just took the money and did not in any way offer us any form of service for this money. how can i recover this money?
Watched one of their commercials and contacted them by phone. I was told that to handle my case I had to ok a money withdrawal from my checking account in the amount of $5500.00. After 30 days and no communication other than paperwork that was sent to me, I called and was told that 30 days had past and no response from me so I had to pay another $3900.00 to them to continue working on my case. At this pont I figured I had no choice and agreed. Then nothing happened for a number of months until I call and was put in touch with another associate. So far all that has happened is I have to sign an agreement with the IRS stating that I will pay $533/month. I could of accomplished this by myself.
I called American Tax Relief when I found out that in spite of trying to pay our taxes properly, we still owed $11,000. All the guy on the phone cared about was How much can you send us today? He mentioned a figure which seemed a reasonable amount but alarm bells rang when I realized that all he had to go on was an amount due and no specifics on the situation. When I started to ask questions he swore at me and told me I guess you don't need help. and then sworw agin and hung up.
I did a free consultation with American Tax Relief during which my credit card number was taken. I opted to not use their services and after calling them to inform them I did not want to proceed, I also sent them a fax terminating my case. Two days after the date of my fax my credit card was charged $2450. When I discovered the charge on my credit card I called them to remove it. They talked in circles about how I was not in their database so they had no record of the charge and couldn't issue a credit. Fortunately, my credit card company dispute manager got them on a conference call and they changed their tune and said they would issue a credit.
Took $2750 for a fee. I said I could not afford $5,500 - he said that he'd 'work with me' about any further amount - came to find out they sent a bank draft to my bank account and without my knowledge or consent, withdrew the remaining $2750. Then I got a call from his supervisor that he needed another $3500 because the amount owed the IRS was $20,000 more than I told Campbell, which was NOT TRUE! I defaulted on my alimony, mortgage and ALL bills due this month, there is just no money in the till now!
I paid American Tax Relief $10,000 in advance to settle a $122,000 payroll tax debt. ATR claimed that they could get the bill reduced by at least 60%. Once we paid we could not get a direct response or information from ATR on how our case was progressing. They gave us inaccurate and misleading information or no information at all. We had to attend a meeting with our local IRS agent without legal representation even though their literature indicated we would no longer have to deal with IRS. When we called to get answers the people at ATR hung up on us and would not return calls. We have since obtained other legal counsel to resolve our tax issue and they have indicated other numerous errors made by ATR.
I am one the unfortunate victims of American Tax Relief (ATR). This company based in Hollywood and Los Angeles, California, advertises by way of radio and television that they can help individuals with issues with the IRS and can stop liens and negotiate IRS debt down to next to nothing. I enlisted their services with a deposit of $2750 to which they debited from my credit card on January 29, 2008. Robert Campbell (the representative from ATR) said that he would have the lien removed from my payroll check immediately. A month later nothing much was done. Unfortunately, after they received my deposit I found dozens of complaints about this company defrauding customers out of thousands of dollars and their being in worse shape than when they first contacted them. I faxed a letter to ATR on March 5th expressing my dissatisfaction with their service and my concerns about the many complaints I found, and requested a refund. Typical of the behavior other past customers experienced, Mr. Campbell left me a phone message around 8:15 a.m. on March 6, 2008, calling me a liar and said that they will pursue collection of the additional $2750 I supposedly owe their company. I am sorry that I had anything to do with this company. Not only do I still have to clear up this IRS issue, I have incurred more debt by charging this $2750 on my credit card, and now my credit will probably be in jeopardy because they are coming after me for the balance. Someone needs to pursue putting this company out of business for good! How someone with such a horrible reputation and history of defrauding consumers can continue to do business is beyond me.
I thought I was dealing with an honest company to assist me with a huge tax burden. I was so desperate for help that I completely lost all of my common sense...that is: If it sounds too good to be true it probably is. These people are so sick and deserve dire consequences. I had originally tried to deal with the IRS on my own but had little success. As my tax liability (with penalties and interest) grew, I was at a loss at what to do. I went to ATR for help after hearing their commercial on TV and radio. I should have known from the start that this was nothing but a scam. Unfortunately, I was so desperate. How I have come to regret that now! I paid ATR 2 separate payments of $3250 to help me settle a tax liability of $51,000 for less than $20,000. Wow, I thought, this is the way to go. I was so wrong. They make you fill out tons of paperwork to masquerade as actually working a case file. Sadly, I came to find out yesterday that my entire bank accounts have been cleaned out by the IRS due to a levy! I am ruined financially, no thanks to American Tax Relief. These guys, especially Sean Madden, are evil. I lost $6500 to American Tax Relief. I also had $9300 seized from my bank account to pay a portion of my outstanding balance. I was left with the impression that they were still going to work on my case. After reading all of these horror stories online, I am certain my options have totally run out.
I want all consumers to beware of this unethical company with their false claims of being able to settle your tax debts for pennies on the dollar. All they want is to collect your money before they ever understand your specific tax situation. The individuals that answer their phones are hard core sales people with no tax knowledge or expertise. They take advantage of individuals who truly need help on very serious tax situations and never intend to do anything about it, except to collect outrageous fees before they ever even examine your specific case. At the end of the conversation they ask you for your bank information and want you to immediately fax over documents to them that will allow them to take money right out of your bank account for their fees. When my husband called them and asked them questions, they yelled at him and said 'when you get serious about your taxes, call us' and hung up on him. Out of curiosity and already disgusted, I called back and this same guy was making disgusting comments about women referring to them as 'chicks' and then proceeded to ask me to fax a power of attorney and my bank info. I was smart enough to know a scam when I see one, so I want to warn anyone else out there who is thinking of using them to BEWARE! I settled my own issues with the IRS directly. The IRS posts a warning on their website about agencies claiming to settle tax issues for pennies on the dollar. Before you ever give your money to a place like this, try to work directly with the IRS or call the tax advocacy. If that does not work, find a legitimate tax attorney! I am lucky that I was smart enough NOT to consider dealing with this Boiler Room, so they did not get one, single penny from me. You can even call the tax advocacy and they will help you to resolve your issue. This is what I did. THANK GOD I did not buy into this horrendous scam.
I hired American Tax Relief about 8 months ago to help me resolve some tax issues. I paid them $4900 and was told that as soon as I signed over power of attorney to them, the tax dept could not legally take any of the aggressive actions they were threatening. Three days later the tax dept. did show up and took possession of my restaurant, changing the locks and threatening to start auctioning off the business contents in 12 days if I didn't come up with almost $9000. I borrowed the money, opened my business back up and continued dialog with the people at American Tax Relief. They assured me that what the tax dept. had done was illegal and that they could still help me resolve the tax problems. I returned all the questionnaires and all other requested statements, etc. For the last 8 months I was under the impression that this company was working for me. I finally received a voicemail in November 2007 from Shawn Madden, from ATR, stating that he would really like to get moving on my case, and I needed to return his call. Upon calling Shawn Madden I learned that nothing had been done on my case. He claimed that he had never received a completed questionnaire and that I had terminated his company's POA with the tax dept. I sent him proof that the POA was still in effect but was told that I would still have to send him another $3500 to resume work on the account as he hadn't received the questionnaire. I told him that I desperately needed help as the tax dept. was once again threatening to seize my business, and that I didn't have any more money to give him. He told me to call him back when I came up with the money, until then there was nothing he could do for me. I've had to close up my business. The tax dept gave me until 1-17-08 to come up with $26,000, or they were going to once again seize and auction off my business. I just didn't have the money, and I didn't have any choices. I'm out of business, unemployed, and so far in debt that it scares me to death. The people at ATR made me a lot of promises and assurances and did nothing at all to help. They took my money and ran. I was desperate for help. I guess that makes for the perfect victim.
In 2003 I paid ATR $3500. in cash to settle my tax debt with the IRS. Every time I contacted them (they never called me), to inquire about progress they were making, they gave me an excuse as to why I could not speak with my attorney. My tax debt continued to increase and my wages were garnished. I still could not get an answer from ATR as to what was going on. I ended up calling the IRS myself and found out that no one from ATR had ever contacted them. In 2006, I wrote to the CA Attorney General, WI Dept. of Consumer Protection and I attempted to file a complaint in small claims court. Three times I paid the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Dept. to serve the papers. They were never served on time. I contacted a local process server to serve papers and he claimed that ATR was out of business and nothing further could be done. Within the past three months I have heard their advertisment on the local radio station and they have the same address. Is there anything more that I can do to recover my $3500? I would use that money to pay the IRS. I still owe them well over $12,000. My wages were garnished 25% of $9.00/hr. I was able to have that reduced to 15%. I now work part time and I am paying them $50.00 a month. I have suffered great embarrassment at my jobs as they knew how much I owed to the IRS. My credit is non-existent. I saved some money to make an Offer and Compromise. Money that I should be saving for retirement as I am 52 years old. This situation has also taken a toll on my mental health and I continue to take antidepressants to combat the resulting depression and anxiety.
In April of 2006 I called ATR. I was connected to a James Flemming who immediately stated that in order to retain their services I needed to deposit the amount of $5,500.00. The money was transfered immediately by wire transer. I was able to speak to James on two seperate occasions and we sent all necessary paperwork that he requested. When I could not reach him again, I was then directed to a women that said James was first on leave and then she later stated that he had taken a leave of absence and that she was taking over his accounts. I sent all the paperwork again to her as she could not find the paperwork I had previous sent. They were suppose to contact the IRS but also failed to do so. After not hearing from them when the IRS deadline was fast approaching I was told by ATR that there was nothing that they could do for me and could not help me further. The bottom line is that I paid them $5,500.00 and I did not receive any help from American Tax Relief. I then had to paid the IRS monies owed which amounted to a sum of over 40 thousand plus dollars.
I saw a commercial for American Tax Relief. I thought, finally an answer to my tax problem. I had gone through a divorce during the previous tax year. I am the owner of a small preschool in Tennessee. I fought for my preschool during the divorce and luckily enough I was able to retain sole ownership. Although, during the process of the divorce I began paying myself a regular salary due to the fact that I was now a single mom. I began having to make the choice between feeding my kids and pay my bills or pay the tax. I thought I could catch up on my taxes, but little did I know how quickly and enormously the penalties and interest would grow. I called the 800 number hoping to work with someone knowledgeable about taxes. I really wanted to make a repayment plan. I was told by one of the Hannahs at ATR that I qualified for the penalty abatement program. I was under the impression once I sent in all of my paperwork they would begin to represent my company and resolve my tax issues. I was sent an enormous amount of paperwork to fill out and a huge amount of copies to send to the company. I would call the company to ask questions, be put on hold, told someone would return my call shortly and never would. The paperwork was so detailed that an average person could not understand what to send back to them. I spoke with someone who told me to just send it back incomplete! Yet, on the paperwork it clearly states not to send imcomplete paperwork. After, some time had passed I spoke with Chris Hannah who proceded to talk to me like I was uneducated and told me that I had passed the time limit. I told him I had every piece of correspondence from the company and no where on the paperwork did it explain that there was any time line after only speaking to someone that I had to have the paperwork back. I understood that once they had all of my information they would move forward in representing me to the IRS. I was treated very poorly and the company attitude was not professional. They also tried to get me to pay an additional $4,000! I had to take out a loan for the first $4,000. I have no where elso to turn and now I am too afraid to hire another firm. I am further indebted to the IRS due to the amount of time that has passed. I have not seen any action on behalf of the American Tax Relief. They took my $4,000.00 and did ABSOLUTELY NOTHING for my company.
Well my story is the same as all the rest, I was taken by ATR. They promised they would take care of my tax problem. I got nothing. Tonight I got a phone call telling me the IRS was now saying I owed more money then they first reported. And now I need to pay ATR more money because there is more work to do. I already paid them $4000 and now ATR needs $4600 to settle my trouble with the IRS. Im out the $4000,and I'm still in trouble with the IRS!
I called and asked for a receipt from American Tax Relief for the 11 thousand dollars I paid them to do tax work in 2006. Frist of all they never did the work !!! and then when I asked for a receipt they said I should have kept better records and paid the IRS. He Rick George ( if that's his name ) said he would not send the receipt from my payment because he saw that I complained about him. These people should be out of business. Why does the IRS let them continue ?
I was laid off after 25 years with the same company, shortly there after I developed severe RA, I could not walk or use my hands, was on many perscription drugs. I withdrew some of my 401K but at end of year but forgot to include in my tax filing. Got a big bill from the IRS. Called ATR to get some help. They charged me $5,500 and promised that they would reduce the amount owed and get me on a payment plan. During that time my wife developed cancer, need less to say we really needed their help, we got nothing for our $5,500.00. With all the medical bills we had to sell our home and now a year later I'm working with the IRS to avoid a lien...... I'm working two jobs and my wife is working full time and we are facing liens and levies...... read more hide
I contacted ATR in response to a direct mail solicitation. Eli guaranteed me that they could resolve my tax problems. He used pressure sales tactics to get me to agree to allow him to deduct $3000 from my bank account before the conversation was over. The next day I contacted my accountant. My accountant had recently hired a former high-level IRS manager who had been personally responsible for approving/denying OICs. My accountant said his firm would handle the case for the same amount that I had paid ATR, and throw in tax prep for three years besides. I immediately called ATR to ask for a refund. They said that my 24-hour refund period had lapsed. I told them that I was going to have my accountant do the OIC anyway. They said, fine, you have a fully paid-up account with us when you decide you need our help. I got burned by my accountant, who after three years had still not filed my OIC and who billed me $14,000 for services NOT rendered. Everytime I gave him the documents he requested, no action was taken; the information would become obsolete and I would do all the research again...I had the distinct feeling I was dealing with a crew of alcoholics. But, back to ATR... After I fired my accountant I called back ATR and reminded them of my fully paid up account. In the meantime penalties had accrued and my case had ballooned to where I owed over $200K. The ATR rep said that since it was much larger case necessitating more work they had to charge another $5000. I told them that they did not have my permission to charge more funds, and since they refused to honor their word they did not have permission to work on the case---I prefer to deal with people who are honorable. Later, to be safe, I checked with my bank and ATR Had taken $1000 from my account, which the bank retrieved from them. I actually closed the account and opened a new one to protect myself from ATR. So, after spending $6000 on two different white-collar bandit firms I decided to file the OIC myself. It took me about 5 solid days of work. I researched and found software on the web that cost $100 and that helped automate the process of filling out the forms; it's the software that your accountant would use if you hired him/her to do the job. I bought some books that helped. I called the IRS numerous times and with each call I was given another hint, another tiny clue that helped me stay on course. After I filed the Offer I completed myself it was accepted; I negotiated a $33K settlement on at $216K debt. YOU CAN DO THIS YOURSELF. Also, know this: it doesn't matter how large your debt to the IRS is, the amount of work to fill out the OIC forms is exactly the same for a $10K debt as it is for a multi-million debt (although of course sorting out accounts will be more complex if you're the type of person with lots of money). I was ripped off for $3000 by ATR, and for $3000 by my accountant. read more hide
big promises, little delivery; As POA for my mother I contacted this compamy to help reduce a 32K dollar IRS debt. I paid them 4700 dollars and the only thing they did was set up a payment plan. The IRS took every penny she had out of her bank account, and is still putting a lien on her condo. this women is 80, suffers from Alzheimers, and lives in a care home. There was no reduction of fees, interest, or total amount due. Now every penny plus is taken paying the care home and IRS. There isn't even enough left over to pay the minimun balance due on the credit card that paid the tax relief company. read more hide
I payed American Tax Relief $5,300 in late July of 2005 for representation to the IRS. My tax debt at that time was $60,036. I got notices from the IRS in June of this year saying they now wanted $76,680. When I got last year's notice from the IRS, I called ATR and they had me send it to them saying don't worry and let us do our job. I did because this is what I paid for. After more than 30 phone calls in the month of June of this year (before and after recieving more notices from the IRS) and NOT ONE return, I contacted the IRS (I have names and numbers) and was told that ATR had only contacted them about my case three times (with the most recent one being in February of 2006). I sent cancellations of their Power of Attorney to represent me (to ATR and the IRS) and began talking directly to the IRS to get this over with. My tax liability has, under ATR's direct compensated involvement to avoid, has not only not been addressed but has grown approximately $17,000. Why are they not accountable and why can someone not hold them responsible for monetary damages? Besides the original $5,300 for services never rendered, my tax liability has, under ATR's direct compensated involvement to avoid, has not only gone un-addressed but has grown approximately $17,000. Two years later and a 28% increase in my tax liability because of these fools. It's safe to say that they did exactly what they set out to do and cost me money. Not only what they took in the beginning but then making it grow by ignoring the IRS while telling me and my wife don't worry about it. Let us do what you paid us to do. read more hide
I also owed money to the IRS and called ATR. They said they would save me at least half of what I owed. $15000. Took over two years and finally got a reply from the IRS telling me to pay the tax in full. As far as I am concerned they did nothing for me. read more hide
I paid $5,300 in late July of 2005 to American Tax relief for representation. My tax liability was just over $50,000 when I contacted these people. It has now been 22 months since first contact and they won't return a phone call. I've left approximately 32 messages (with Stacey Brandon and a supervisor named Hadji Chana) in the last ten working days. My latest notice from the IRS has my tax liability at approximately $77,000. I called the IRS today (Friday 15 June 2007)and their representative said that ATR's Stacey Brandon had contacted them in December of 2005, and twice in February of 2006. That's a total of three calls on my behalf in 22 months and seemingly no attempt at resolution whatsoever. The econimic damage is obvious. My tax liability has grown since they got my $5,300 and I'm now in debt over this up to about $82,000. My income is less than $40,000 per year and my wife doesn't work. At a minimum I feel like American Tax Relief owes me my original $5,300 (plus interest and penalties) plus the difference of what I owed when I contracted with these people. At the most, they can pay my back taxes plus punitive damages. They misrepresented themselves and would not talk to myself or my wife during this process except to tell us we're going to take care of this for you, just relax. This has been a tremendous stress on my wife, our marriage, and our lives. read more hide
I am a single mother that has got behind in taxes that I could not afford. I owed approx. $13,000. I contacted American Tax Releif and was told that they could lower the amout to approx. $4000. I payed them $3,900 in April 2006 to take care of this. It is now June 2007 and they did nothing. I am now out of the $3,900 and my taxes are up to almost $15,000 because of late fees and interest. I had to set up a payment plan myself and now there is a lien on my property. This has been a huge strain on me and my children. $that $3,900 could have went a long way in feeding and clothing my girls, but instead a company that I thought I could trust took it from us. Now my tax debt is worst than it was a year ago. I wanted to contact the IRS last year but was told by ATR not to do so. read more hide
I paid American Tax Relief $4000.00 in March of 2005, I was asked to pay the money within minutes of asking what they could do for me. The company did nothing and the IRS continues to hound me. I contacted ATR on 5/7/07 and was told by them that I would need to pay another $5000.00 for another POA and that they would not repay my money. I would like to speak with anyone who would be willing to pursue a class action suit against this company of thieves. I have chronic kidney disease and American Tax Credit took my money when I was going through Kidney Cancer, I was so ill and thought that they would help. read more hide
I had some IRS problems some of my 941 had not been paid. It was an honest mistake that my bookkeeper over looked. I called American tax relief to get help the guy I talked to said I can gurantee you, I will get you out of pentatils & intrest so I paid his company $5,500.00 to help me. And guess What? They didn't do anything. As the dead line for payment got closer My Wife took it upon herself to contact the IRS and get to the bottom of what we could do. So american tax relief did nothing. I call and spoke to george At ATR he told me he was going to keep my money. He actully told me I'm keep your money every cent of it, and I defy you to get it back. I don't know what else to do. As if it were not bad enough oweing the IRS some undetermined amount of nothing less than $8,000.00. Then American tax relief cliped me for $5,500.00. I would say i have been damaged very much. I own a very small business, I have maxed out my line of credit, to make ends meet and looking for answers. read more hide
I called American Tax Relief (ATR) for help with the IRS and their aggressive collection manners. I briefly explained to Steve about my situation, without hesitation he said ATR could help. He just needed to ask me some questions. He asked, I responded. You initially feel a sense of relief knowing someone is going to help you with the biggest thorn in your side. After a couple of minutes of asking questions, he puts me on hold. I hold for about 3 minutes (thought we got disconnected). When he returned, he said that he called my bank and drafted my checking account. I was shocked! And what was worse, it was for $7,500.00. The company states that I authorized it, that couldn't be right because I didn't have that kind of money in the account (bank statement verifies this). If he had told me what it was going to cost me for ATR to help me, I wouldn't have been able to do it. I scrambled to get the money in because Steve said ATR can help and it would be immediately after they receive their fee. I would never have to speak directly with IRS agents from that point on. There was no consulting in any form in either of the 2 times we spoke (first call was when he drafted my account and the second call I said that the IRS was still calling me and he said don't worry about it, he'll call them). I NEVER spoke to any attorneys or enrolled agents listed on the POA. I cried for help when the IRS placed a federal lien against me - no response from ATR. I cried for help when the IRS levied my accounts receivables - no response from ATR. I cried for help when the IRS levied my bank accounts - no response from ATR. I cried for help again when another federal lien was filed against me - no response from ATR. When I called, I spoke to a receptionist or a sales person I could never get through to an attorney or enrolled agent. They always said, your enrolled agent will call you in the morning - I never got a call back, ever. I purchased their services in February '06, it wasn't until sometime in April '06 it was realized that they didn't have correct POA papers. WHAT? I sent all my information in as requested, there was no follow up. I know they received it because I sent it confirm recipient's signature. The IRS agent assigned to my case never received the POA so she made several visits to my home, continued to call daily and all the while I kept saying that ATR was my POA and to contact them. Since ATR never intercepted any of the IRS's actions, I had 3 federal liens filed against me, my checking accounts and accounts receivables were levied. By June '06, I said enough and requested a refund (6 times). When I got no response, phone call or mail, I sent my complaint into my State's Division of Consumer Protection/Fraud Department and California's Attorney General. ATR claims that I didn't cancel within the 5 day cancel period -and only get half your payment. ATR stated that working with the IRS is a step-by-step process. If that is the case, how can they say that a customer only has 5 days to decide to continue business with ATR when in 5 days that is absolutely impossible to determine. I am pursuing my complaint with my State's Department of Justice as well as the State of California's Attorney General. I am also obtaining a private attorney for guidance. This company should not be able to continue business in this manner. We, the consumer, must take some kind of action. Yes, we messed up with the IRS, but it doesn't give American Tax Relief the right to take advantage of that - they advertise that they can help settle with the IRS for past due taxes, they advertise that we would never have to communicate directly with the IRS that they will speak on your behalf, they say that you may pay much less than what is owed but you end up paying more. A lot more. read more hide
American Tax Relief told us it would cost $3,250 to do an offer in compromise. We signed their authorization form which states that $3,250 would be charged on our credit card. We wound up paying them $6,500 because they ran it through twice. The credit card company is ging to file a fraud complaint against them. "Eli" told me that the IRS debt could be settled for $10,000, but the completed offer that ATR sent me showed that I have to pay the IRS over $40,000, even though I owe them $65,000. read more hide
i paid ATR $3200 after a free consultation in which they promised me that they could help me with my case. I explained my entire financial situation to them and they said they would file an offer in comprimise and get my tax problems solved. 14 months later, after i did 98% of the work, the irs says they will not accept any offer, i am to pay up in full. Now ATR says too bad, so sorry. I divulged complete & accurate info to ATR before i ever paid them. They completely lied to me, accepted money under false pretenses. Now i'm in worse shape than before & have been financially & mentally damaged! read more hide
My husband and I hired American Tax Relief to represent us in arranging payment plans for our 2002 Federal and State Income tax reports. Our contact is Jim Fleming. Unfortunately, after paying their service fee which is a total of $6,000 plus fees, we were unable to begin the payment plan because my husband was still unemployed (since Sept. 11th of 2001). My husband just got a job and started working in March of this year 2006. Two weeks ago, my employer received a notice from the Franchise Tax Board to commence deductions from my payroll effective 5/12/06. I faxed a copy of this FTB notice to Jim Fleming at American Tax Relief requesting they resume their services to represent us on this matter so we can now begin to make payments. Mr. Fleming contacted my husband and noted their service contract with us expired and that we needed to pay them a new fee of $3,000.00 to get re-started services. Of course, we were not going to pay them again. Well, on April 28th, they must of had a record of our checking account number and was able to debit our account for an intial fee of $1,550.00. read more hide
I was bilked out of almost $12,000 by American Tax Relief and was lied to right down the line. I never spoke with an attorney even though I was told a firm of tax attorneys would be handling my case. They told me that they could cut my debt in half or at least by twice whatever I paid them. They asked for additional monies three times using various excuses while I waited for resolution. I checked these excuses out with the IRS and California State Franchise Tax Board and was told that they had "misinfomed" me and that they had only contacted each agency once in the entire 7 months that I've been waiting to have my tax situation resolved. Now, I've just been informed that the State has put a lien on my properties and the IRS has given me another 4 weeks to settle with them. Both of them told me that I cannot qualify for an "Offer in Compromise" as I was told by American Tax and that my only hope is to set up a payment plan (which, of course, I can't afford). Now I owe additional monies in fines, interest and am out the $12,000 I paid American Tax. read more hide
I paid American Tax Relief $3,900 to assist me in resolving a tax problem I had and still currently is having with the IRS. The IRS notified me of there intent to place a levy on my bank account months after I had contact Mr. B. H, for his company's assistance. However, just as the other individual complained about never receiving call backs, I was hung up on, I would call everyday to see what was going on with my account, and all I was told was my case was transferred to a different department. Interestingly enough, I continued to contact Mr. B and everytime it seem as though the phone rep would get angry and tell me that Mr. B was not availble and he would give him my message and ask to wait for his call back. Mr B. would never call. Once Mr. B called back after I had to tell him that I would go to the media if he refused to return my call within 48hrs. He called back to tell me that his other rep was working on my case. They caused me to loose 10k from my checking account. read more hide
I paid American Tax Relief $3,600 to assist me in resolving a tax problem I had becausse the IRS had notified me of there intent to place a levy. Come to find out two years later they did not ever take care of the issue. Now the IRS has removed every dollar I had in the bank including my checking account which I ended up writing bad checks on because I was unaware it was going to happen and put a levy on most of my salary, leaving me with approximately $160 per week to live on. Interestingly enough, when I try to contact American Tax Relief, the phone reps become excited, start yelling to co-workers, put me on hold, then come back to tell me a supervisor will have to speak to me and then HANG UP. During one phone call though, they told me if I now pay them $3,800 they could take care of this for me. If all of this is not enough, I called the IRS myself and am taking care of having everything resolved. Come to find out they are very helpful and everything that American Tax Relief promised to do for me, I can take care of myself. I hope someone else reads this and isn't too nervous to contact the IRS directly!!! Now if I can figure out a way to get my money back from American Tax Relief I'll be brand new. Doubt that will happen though, considering I have yet to receive a phone call back from one of those managers I need to speak to and I have given them 3 different contact numbers. read more hide
Oh my God! I guess I’m not alone. I paid $3400 to them and they got nothing done for me. I was told that I didn’t have to talk to the IRS and they would handle everything for me. Well, that didn’t happen. The IRS has me in knots. I’ve called so many times and no return calls from them. Some guy name Steve is the last one I got a hold of. He said someone name Lucy would call me back. It’s been a month now. I first contacted them in 2003. I spoke to Joe. He sold me . Boy, He’s good. He made claims and guarantees that never happened. I consider myself to be pretty sharp and can see through the Bull^%#. I guess I was way off on this one. I’m planning to try to contact all folks who were ripped off and get a class action suit going against these guy’s/ The one thing I have on my side is. media contacts and I plane to use my resources. read more hide
After reading numerous complaints concerning American Tax Relief, I know I am not alone! My husband and I have been victomized by this company as well. After reading complaints, we too report the same treatment. We have all been victomized by this company and their contracters. I myself wrote to the State Attorney General of Calif. If enough complaints are received, I believe the the State will look into their business practices. We too were told that no refund was due because of contract agreement. I believe a contract involves both parties and American Tax Relief did not perform under their own contract agreement. read more hide

I had been trying to negotiate with the Georgia Revenue Department to pay back owed taxes. I was having no success as a lay person dealing with a tax department. Like a fool,I contacted American Tax Relief on 9/15/2004 I spoke with Joe B and explained my situation and felt I needed assistance with completing an arrangement for payment. It is now 8/7/2005. I have spent countless hours trying to get them to even answer a phone call. To date they have never called,written or taken any initiative to treat me as a client. Finally in Feb. 2005 they sent me a financial form to send to the Georgia Tax Department for an Offer and Compromise there was so many typing errors I had to return it to them. They took $5000 from me and now tell me they just found out that Georgia made a new rule that an Offer and Compromise can only be submitted every 10 years and my contact and converations with Georgia Revenue Department constitutes an Offer. I reminded them that I had told ATR I had made an Offer to Georgia in my initial conversation with Mr. B and that I had sent them all my records of negotation with Ga. Actually it was a question I answered on a financial form they sent me. So the fact is they knew and saw an open door to get my money and/or negligently by accepting a case saying they were experts in tax resolution and don't know what they are doing and took my money. read more hide
On or about April 15th 2005 we entered into an agreement with American Tax Relief to assist us with reduction of our tax bill. Their representative, Ted G, told us their services included reviewing and submitting our 2004 tax return and negotiating with the IRS for a reduced settlement of tax liability. Based upon Mr. G’s assurances we signed with ATR and paid a fee of $3900.00. Since that time we have sought progress reports without success. Of late, they have even refuted claims made by Mr. G who is no longer employed with that company. We have expressed our deep dissatisfaction with the company through our current contact Norma. She advised us to call their 1800 number and arrange to close the file and apply for a refund. The contact on said number was very rude when we requested a refund, refusing such and hung up on us. read more hide
In September 2003 my husband contacted American Tax Relief for help with tax debt from a defunct business. They took $1600.00 from his account and $1600.00 from my account and sent us a questionnaire. As I am putting this years tax stuff away I asked my husband how our tax issue was being handled. He didn't know, as they never contacted him. I called (800)252-9528 and asked for a refund since I feel they basically took our money and then forgot us. I spoke with a man who said his name was Bob. I explained what had happened and he told me that they never received our paperwork and they did make one follow-up call. I asked for a refund since they had not done anything for us and he explained that the case is too old, the money was for legal representation and there will be no refund. I asked how they could have provided legal representation when they didn't receive our paperwork. He said that they had been in touch with the IRS on our behalf. I then asked for proof and he said no that it was private information. read more hide
