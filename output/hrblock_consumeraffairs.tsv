Don't let H&R Block do your taxes! They have ruined my experience twice by not filing properly. Arbitration was so busy it took them 30 days to contact me back (So I know I'm not the only one). When they called me we got nothing accomplished. I will never use their service again! And I will continue to let my friends, family, co-workers, facebook, twitter, instagram, etc. know they are not who you want to file with. Ever!!!
For the past two years I have used H&R Block. I just returned this year and found H&R Block to be a complete rip-off. It's nice you advertise that you're giving thousand dollars to random customers, but in return you screw the rest of us by charging nearly $100.00 more. It cost me over $400.00 to do my taxes. It took him all of 35 minutes to prepare my tax return. I will never again use H&R Block. I have a very large family that has used H&R. After telling them how I was totally ripped off they are going elsewhere. I will make it a point to let everyone I know to steer clear of very overpriced company.
Had fraudulent transactions on my card. Called as soon as I found out which was the same day and was advised to deactivate current card and get a temporary one in which I did! My remaining funds still haven't been transferred and on top of that no one has even contacted me about the fraudulent charges!! Customer Service is a complete joke and offers no help. All they do is read from a piece of paper.
I usually file in Astoria, which I am very satisfied with. However, I just got engaged and have been staying with my fiance in the city. My return is very simple. Jeanette told me to call in two weeks, as she needed to send for a form. I called, and she did not return my call. At one month after giving her my info, I still did not hear from her, and I think everyone in that office knew my number as I kept leaving it. After over a month's time, I called to get my file so I could bring it to Astoria. They could not find my file. I am not one of those people with "mucho money". I think that Jeanette put me aside for those other people. This whole thing has been getting me sick. I finally got replacement forms and went to my Astoria office, where my taxes were done. I DO NOT advise working class people to go to this office! The lack of respect was despicable!! I filed a complaint, so an investigation is pending about my missing file. Still no calls from Jeanette.
I have been going to H&R Block for 7 years at least. First of all the 9.99 for filing commercial never said anything about it being only for using the software. I thought it was also for in-store use!! They didn't tell me how much it would be until the end which was $211! Everyone else I know paid a quarter of that. They are so ridiculous there and then after 8 weeks without a refund and I get a letter from the IRS saying I missed a couple forms so I called H&R and they just told me to call the IRS and figure it out. What the hell did I pay you over $200 for?! They didn't help me with any of these issues. The form the IRS needed was not copied to my folder or anywhere to be found! What the hell did you do with the form I have you? They are responsible for doing my taxes and when they screw up I have to take care of myself with no help from them! I'm just so confused what did I pay for?? Never again am I going there after 7+ years. Screw you H&R. You're a joke.
I am not one to write bad reviews for any business, but my experience was so bad I felt I had to share. I will NEVER go to H&R Block again to get my taxes prepared. First they had me and my 2 year old there for over 4 hours because their system had to be reset, after me realizing that the amount was way off. Then they charged me over 300$ for one w2!!! Then I had them look at my 2013 taxes that I had not yet claimed and they charged me without my permission. I had planned on getting my paperwork back and getting them done somewhere else because of my horrible experience there. They lie when they tell you they can get you more back than other tax preparers. I had them take a second look at my other taxes from the year before in which I got them done somewhere else for 60$. They couldn't find anything that had been missed. I feel I was robbed and will never use their services again.
Two years ago, a mistake was made on my tax return. It was noticed last year, and the girl asked if I wanted it fixed. I said yes, because it would accrue interest if I left it. I asked for a reassessment, and received a bill from Revenue Canada. She said to take the bill to H&R, and the interest accrued to that point would be paid by H&R. The person I talked to at their office said "anyone with any common sense would have known there was an error". So now that he has determined I am stupid (I don't know what he is saying about his tax professional), he will not help me. When I persisted, he said he would escalate it. After several months and many phone calls, I phoned the 1-800 number and was put to another person. He said I should probably get the interest paid, but the girl that said that should have documented it on my file. I have been trying for a year now to talk to someone who can make a decision, but that person is unwilling to talk. Is this the way their business is run? Who is really stupid? There are many qualified people who will do taxes, and I am smart enough to locate one.
H&R Block prepared our federal and state taxes in 2014. The individual who prepared our taxes made us residents of a State that we do not live in. It was only after speaking with a local CPA that the error was brought to my attention. It took H&R Block approximately 5 months to identify someone who could resolve the problem. We are now in the process of preparing our 2015 taxes and come to find out that we overpaid our Federal taxes in 2014 as well. It has been a horrible, horrible experience and I have come to the conclusion that the staff is only qualified to handle the 1040 EZ forms. Their level of expertise is abysmal. I would highly caution anyone when considering H&R Block. They do not have the talent nor do they recruit the level of talent needed to prepare semi-complex taxes.
They are thieves. They charged me 499 dollars on a 900 dollar return. I worked for free for them. They do it all the time, the overcharge. I will not return to them even if they are the last place left. I see there are more than one person who has had the same problems. They are a bunch of lies. I will let everyone know.
The experience has been a nightmare. I attempted to help my 21-year-old son out by e-filing his taxes. A week later I received an email stating that it was rejected by the IRS due to a pin number. I attempted to contact H&R Block for help. I was told that the H&R Block office has nothing to do with the online service. WHAT? I was told that they did not have a contact number for support, customer service and was not affiliated with the online service in any way, shape or form. How could this be? I'm sure that someone is blowing smoke up my... The only number listed on the site is to IRS who tells me that they have not received his taxes (my son). WHAT DO I DO? I know have a twenty-year-old asking me, "MOM, WHERE IS MY MONEY?" I went on the IRS site to retrieve a pin number and it tells me the information is not matching. Should I refile, how do I get my fee back from H&R Block. Where is a live person. This has GOT to be illegal. Each review should be forwarded to the attorney general.
After 6 years with H&R, I'm giving up!!! Had to give up on people but it's time. I think the Woonsocket office sucks!!! The experience with them has been harder to take every year. I think they should learn how to treat people much better. Learn their jobs. So unhappy. Next year some place nice. Anywhere.
I made an appointment with H&R Block on Saturday 3/2016 at 11:30 am with **. I came to my appointment right on time and waited 25 minutes till ** finished with the previous client. While waiting, another client walked into the place around 11:55 am, she had an appointment at 12 pm. ** finished with her current client, so OBVIOUSLY it was my turn. However, she decided to transfer me to another colleague of hers (African American Lady), and take the 12 pm client. I talked to the African American Lady and told her that I specifically made the appointment with ** just because she knows my situation. And it's NOT FAIR to take the 12 pm client while I waited for almost half an hour. The African American Lady (I don't know her name) got upset. ** just ignored the whole situation and I did NOT even get anything done. BOTTOM LINE: this place will waste your time, try another H&R Block office. They don't appreciate your time or even you as a client. I have been dealing with H&R for over 8 years, I've never had this Horrible service until I switched to H&R block of Bobby Jones Expy Ste 118 Augusta, Ga 30907.
I went in person to make my appointment. At that time I asked if they could help me remove interest with back taxes. They told me they could. After arriving at the appointment and after completing the form they tell me they cannot help me with the interest on the back taxes. I was charged $179.06 for them to do a short form tax return. They also talked me into a visa card that they told me was free to get my return credited to because the lying ** told me that IRS does not send a paper check in the mail anymore, another lie. She slapped the card down on the desk and laughed and said "you won't need it anyway because they will probably take it all anyway." On my receipt I was charged $16.00 for the card. I also found out that they deduct a charge on the card if you do use it. I made a complaint with the District Manager that took two days to call me back. After I asked his secretary for his boss' number which she stated she did not have I told her "well I figure out who to call then" and hung up. Within 15 min he called me back. I told him what happened. He stated he would call that branch and call me right back, been waiting three days now for him to call back. The service they performed I could have done myself. The only reason I went was that they said they could help me with the back tax issues. They are lying crooks!
The worse tax preparer in the state of South Carolina. I went to two different offices (Fort Mill, Indian land) and instead of them saying up front "I don't know what the heck I'm doing," they took my tax information and kept them a week. When I called to check on the status, the Fort Mill office had not touched my taxes. The same happened with the Indian Land office. I wasted my time with this company. Stay clear if you have a business tax.
So, H&R Block is advertising HALF OFF last year's tax prep for new customers. I bit. I called to schedule an appt and confirmed this info with the girl at the call center. She said, "As long as you paid at least $100 last year, the fee will be half. I pull in the parking lot, and there's a lawn sign with the half off info, but nothing about $100. Well, I sit down with the bookkeeper, and learn that they have a MINIMUM fee of $100. That's NOT what the clerk told me, and I told the bookkeeper this. He said, "Yeah, several people have said that." Well, HELLO... If several people have reported getting incorrect info, why hasn't it been corrected? I HATE LIARS!
I have used H&R Block for every return I have prepared in the last 15+ years of filing my taxes. I used to believe that if there were problems, I had someone in my corner that would fix them by doing it that way instead of the numerous free avenues. I have never gotten to test that theory until this year, and I found that doing it myself is the better route, because that's the route that H&R Block takes with its customers anyways. I sat for 2 hours and paid almost $200 to have someone fumble their way through a 1040EZ that should have taken less than half an hour. I moved in the previous year, so I provided both my previous and current addresses. No change of address form was filled out. The wrong school district was used and I suddenly owed the state almost $100. There were numerous errors made. The bank information that was provided entered incorrectly. My Federal file was accepted, but the state kicked my file back and said there were too many errors. I spent ANOTHER hour in a different HRB office because that's how long it took to undo all the errors the first person made. Today marks 60 days since I e-filed from an HRB office, and I have not received my refund yet. I finally spent the time to call the IRS. My return was sent over a month ago, so call my bank. I call my bank, they never received anything. Spent another hour calling the IRS, was finally given the banking information that my return was sent to, but they could not access it. I hung up and Googled the routing number, and for 5 weeks my return has been sitting in an HR Block account. And THAT'S when my day turned from tolerable to me wanting to break things. First off, the reason that I had not received anything from HR Block is because there is magically a debt owed from 3 years ago that I never heard anything about that is almost the exact amount of my current year's return that's owed to me. The best part is that was the year that someone got a hold of my W2's and filed in my name - I've already had to fill out countless forms with the IRS, file a police investigation, and wait 9 months before that money was returned to me. How do I owe you ANYTHING for that, and why did I not hear about it for 3 years? When I inquired, I was told I needed to speak to the person who prepared that return for me. Of course, most businesses do all their work on computers so they can reference that information - I work as a friggin' valet, a job with minimal importance to anyone - and can still look up past customers at the drop of a dime. Nope. I have to wait until 6:15 PM tonight for that person to call me back. Then I asked if, since there were so many mistakes with a form that is arguably the most straightforward tax return to prepare, that the exorbitant price of $187 for prep could be returned to me, because all of this mess started with H&R Block. WELL... I'd have to file a complaint and go into the office and see if they could make reparations with me there, so I was basically told that HRB does not police the activity of or take responsibility for their own employees that operate under their company name, and I'd have to work it out with that office. So, let's recap - I gave them almost $200 to do a one-page 1040EZ with one W2 and an address change, and the result of all that is 60 days later, I have zero money, am likely getting audited by the State, have all my money being held in limbo because of a supposed debt that no one mentioned until I filed a return that was suspiciously close to the exact dollar amount I was supposed to get back, that "debt" is being validated by a return that was a crime against me to begin with, and the only way for me to solve ANY of it is to do it all myself? I will never (there is not enough stress in the known universe for me to put on that to demonstrate my resolve), EVER set foot in an HR Block again, and they will never see another dime of my money. This is the worst customer service I have ever encountered (and I have Time Warner Cable!!), and I am beyond blown away at how little they are willing to do when everything that has happened is a direct result of their own negligence. I used to be a fan and would have recommended them. Pretty sure they've cured me of that for life. Stay away.
I have been a client of H&R Block in Redmond, Oregon, for over ten years. Last year (2015) my tax preparer retired and I was given a different preparer. After having my taxes prepared and upon returning home I noticed I was charged almost twice as much as last year. I called Redmond H&R Block and questioned the difference in fees. I was told the message would be given to the tax person. I received a message on my phone stating that my previous tax preparer was being nice and had given me discounts on the forms (rather expensive forms?). I don’t think she would have done anything unethical and was wondering why I pay $200 more for my tax fees because she retired. Nothing has changed on my side except my income went down; I didn’t work part-time last year so I, possibly, used even less forms this year. I’m a senior, could someone explain??? $200 is quite a lot of money for someone on Social Security. This is what I sent after getting NO reply to either of my TWO emails. I did make phone contact on 2/27, the day after my taxes were prepared. ALMOST DOUBLE FEES (3/7/16). Trying again. I would like to think I have received no response to my “Opinion” in the last week was because somehow you had not received it. I didn’t even get an automated form letter stating my Opinion has been received.
I have been using H&R block tax preparation services for 20 years.The past two years has been difficult for me and my family, since we moved from California to Oklahoma. I currently live in Mustang, Oklahoma. The town is very small and the location that we have prepare our taxes is family owned. We have lived here 3 years, and gone to the same location 3 times, although the past two years has been terrible. The first year a gentleman who was not a part of the family business prepared our taxes for us and it was a great experience. The last two years the daughter of the family owned business representing H&R block prepared our taxes and it was horrible. She looked as if she had done hard drugs for many years, making it almost unbearable to deal with, whipping through our preparation and being very vague with questions me and my wife had regarding our preparation. I never received less of a refund than the past two years leading me to believe that she was making mistakes that were costing me money. I am going to take my information to someone else to review. This year I decided to bring a friend to have their taxes prepared by H&R also. Most tax preparation companies reward you for referrals. Not this location. She said that they are still figuring out the rules and neither I nor my referral would receive any discount or compensation. Then later stated that she was giving other people the benefits as she chose. Very shady. I can't stand small business owners that represent another company and do not follow policy. I will never use H&R block EVER AGAIN.
They called to schedule my appointment as a follow up from the year before. I said, I am not returning price was way too high (over $400, just for federal return). A week later I get an offer email from the local office "We want to WIN you back, pay no more than $100 or half of what you paid last year." I replied to the email. "Thank you for the offer, I will call today to make an appointment. Since this offer has been sent I will give you another try, since pricing was my reason for not returning." I change my schedule, arrange childcare, go there for my appoint. 2.5 hours later she totals up my bill. I remind her of the email she sent me and then she says, "That is for new clients only." NEW CLIENTS? Title of email offer was "WE WANT TO WIN YOU BACK". THEY REFUSED TO REDUCE FEE. I called main corporate office in Missouri and was told, "they had no right to send that to you. You will have to speak to a local manager in the store." At what point in time does a corporation not take responsibility for their team and local stores? It is a direct reflection on them. I have filed with the county consumer fraud board and BBB. I will be outside with picket sign this weekend>>> all the way to the end of tax season. Liars, cheats and scammers.
I made an appointment at for 11:00 AM on 3/8/2016 with your Charlestown office in Boston MA. This was my lunch time that I was using to get this done. As of 11:00 am there was no one there to do my taxes as the individual had not come in yet. The receptionist wanted to start my taxes then hand them over when the individual arrived which I did not want to do. If the Office did not have anyone that would be there at 11:00 AM then they should not have confirmed my appointment. Where is the customer service. My time is also very valuable. I took the time from work to come in early so that the was not a rush but instead there was no tax preparer available. Very poor customer services..
I am a bandleader and I have a partner that shares the expenses. We have been going to H&R Block for the past 3 years because we trusted the company brand name. The first year we went it cost us $50 just to prepare the 1099 forms, which was done in a couple of days by Helen **, and we thought this was very reasonable. We returned last year and a guy named Ken ** did the forms and charged us $75, a 50% markup from the prior year! We weren't happy but we paid and moved on. This year, 2016, we again went to the H&R Block of prior years. This time the service cost $90, and the preparer didn't include 2 of the employees on the form and had us come back on top of that. He is the senior preparer in the office and considered a "Master Tax Advisor", but wasn't able to complete the forms as accurately as Miss ** nor as fast! He then went on to say he was calling the regional director to see if he could discount the pricing. I am a manager myself and a small business owner and have also worked in customer service and know for a fact that even the first level of customer service can give a discount. The audacity of a person in his position to assume that everyone is so ignorant and gullible to believe such "hogwash!" (I am going to refrain from using other choice vocabulary to describe what I actually think). This is hopefully going to reach thousands of people and thus tarnish the reputable name of the H&R Block Tax Company! I was deeply offended by the 80% markup of the service, and the time it took, as well as the smug attitude of Kenneth **. I will never use this company again, and will definitely try my best to refer people I know to use Liberty and other companies as a result! I am a very unsatisfied customer and haven't even filed my personal taxes yet and will use Liberty. If I could protest and carry a sign to persuade people not to go in there I would. That's how irritated I am over this. My personal rating of this place is 1/2 a star, and that's only because he finally finished it.
After attempting to file my taxes online, I was told that I'd need to pay $9.99 to file my taxes for the state. This seemed a bit high, but I went with it. After submitting my taxes, I received an email saying that my taxes had been rejected at the federal level, which means the state taxes would not go through at all. I immediately called H&R Block to request a refund for the $9.99 fee I'd just paid since state taxes would not be filed. They told me that I'd already "used the product" so they'd be unable to refund me. Seriously? The product didn't work, and now I have to refile my entire taxes from start to finish. I will never use H&R Block's services again. EVER.
I took advantage this year of the "Get More Refund" promotion and pledged $5,000 of my Fed refund in return for additional $500 in gift card value. 21 days after IRS acceptance and with the remainder of my refund already received via wire, H&R can't locate my $5,500 it owes me. Spent more than 5 hours and 9 separate calls and escalation to Tier 3 support and still nothing.
Do not get a advance on your taxes from H&R Block. They were suppose to take it out of my federal taxes but did not so every time I get my paycheck on my card they wait a couple of days and whatever I have on there they take the money. Call them and they say there is nothing they can do. I know I owe them but they were suppose to call and let me set up payment arrangement but it never happen so I am going to cancel my card that way. They will not be getting any more money from me. Not a happy person with these people.
I have used this tax software for some years having no issues. Well I have read previous reviews, and now I am currently in the same boat. Out 1000$ because I put it in a gift card, for the H&R Block bonus gift card program. There needs to be some investigation into this, and us the consumers need to be refunded our money. I will update if they get to the bottom of the issue, but so far I have spoke to 3 customer representatives and no luck. They will know I will not use them again.
I have been getting my taxes & my mother's taxes done at H&R Block for many years. My mother passed in 2015. I had her taxes done at H&R Block. It cost 300.00 plus had to pay 500 back in taxes. I will never go back. That is highway robbery. All they do is change a few numbers in the computer and charge 300. Mine wasn't cheap either.
This is the last year I will have my taxes completed through this company. Both years they have "lost" my appointment. I had to return three times and waited over an hour for each. The rep showed me how much I would get back if I was fraudulent.
I have used H&R Block for many years, the past 2 years have been a nightmare. Last year I was not informed there was a flag on my account for a federal debt I owed, meaning my taxes could possibly go towards the debt (which they were). The lady who filed also did not do my child care credit. This year, the SAME lady informed me my account was flagged, but did not tell me due to all my taxes being withheld last year, my tax prep fee was not paid and that I owed H&R Block for last year's preparation as well as this year. I've been calling the office I went to and have received horrible service. "I'm sorry, I do not know what happened to your money. It should already be in your account by now." I've had to do my own investigation, and finally got to the bottom of it. I am outraged, two years in a row, ** service. Never again will I use them for taxes. Money being taken that I deserve left and right, if I would've been informed of the debt I could've paid upfront. Absolutely ridiculous, never again will I use H&R Block.
This tax year (2015) using H&R Block has been a nightmare. I thought I would file early this year to get my early refund via e-file. I signed up for the extra protection and e-file. After completing my refund online, I could not submit it electronically because I had to assign a tax professional to review it. After trying to contact this person for a week and working with H&R Block support, I found out the person no longer work for nor had access to the system to review my taxes. So then I had to reassign it to another tax professional. This new person went over the 48 and 72 hrs. required review time. Once she review it, she had questions which I answered. I answered the questions and then I had to go into the system to approve my return. After I reviewed my return, I contacted the Tax professional to electronically file. She told me she filed it after I approved it. Then I went to check the status under H&R Block. It showed my federal return was not filed and my state returns were pending e-file. I added a bunch of message for the tax professional online but she does not respond. I called her and she said there was a technical issues and she escalated it with tech support. Bottom line is 3 weeks later, H&R Block still has not e-filed my return and offer not solutions. I requested the tax professional mail overnight my return the next day and send me the tracking numbers. She said "ok". 3 days later, I still do not have my tracking number for the paper mailing, the e-file issue still not resolved, and the tax professional has not responded to my online message. Daily I have had to check the status and follow up for over 3 weeks now. Now I am trying to get my entire refund and file with another provider but no luck with my refund. This business is horrible. They do a horrible job or no job with customer follow-up. The worst customer service I have ever seen. I would never use them again nor do I recommend anyone use them. In fact, I recommend this business be shut down immediately. It operates like a none educated, not trained mom and pop business with two employees trying to service the entire state and or country. I do not wish this experience on my worst enemy. Now I have to spend a third weekend refiling with another provider. The has been extreme pain and suffering, mental anguish, and emotional distress.
We have gone to a college educated certified public accountant but decided to go to H&R Block because it was closer to our home and we received a coupon from H&R Block for one hundred dollars off what you paid your last tax guy from last year. Ok we itemize and we were charged 150.00 from our CPA. This year even with the so called hundred off we paid 400.00. What is wrong with this picture! Nothing different from last year, even less income. I am so mad!!! Why go to H&R Block!!! We will never make this mistake again. Oh and the reason our tax preparer told us it was so much money was because we were paying for the classes that they had to take for Obama care. Don't think we should be paying for that!!! That's H&R's responsibility. Continuing education!!! Absolutely ridiculous!!! Ugh!!!
I was at the Rivers Avenue location of North Charleston, SC and had a really good experience with one of the reps named Octiva **. She went the extra mile trying to help me with my complicated tax issues that arose from having to refile the previous year. Although it was almost effortless on her part because she knew what she was doing, I really appreciated her coming through for me like that.
If you choose to get your refund back on an Emerald Card, do yourself a favor and get the money off as quick as possible. My Emerald Card has been breached for the third time. They keep asking the same questions in fraud and they must investigate. Then you have to wait at least 10-20 days for them to put it back on your card.
1st Situation - I placed a transfer that was suppose to happen in 5 days from H&R to External Bank. On the 5th day (same day scheduled to deposit), Emerald Card Services reversed the funds back to their account. 2nd situation - Contacted Emerald Bank and asked What to do, I was told policies changed and I couldn't withdraw my funds and my account was insufficient (Representative Lied). 3rd Situation- Told to wait 3-5 days for Transfer using Emerald Card Transfer document. Waited 3-5 days, nothing has been transferred (February 15th - February 29 so far). Please, do not do your taxes with H&R Block if you want a peace of mind. You will lose your sanity with them!
I used This service last year without any problems. Today I went to download our Edward Jones tax statements and found out H&R software is not compatible with Edward Jones software "this year". I had no other choice than to go back to our old tax company software and will just stay with them. A least H&R quickly authorized a refund.
My fiancée has used the online version of H&R Block for several years but this year's experience was atrocious. After hours of struggling to get the right info in the right places (and she has a fairly simple return), she submitted her federal return. Only then did her expected state refund increase dramatically, to more than she paid in withheld state taxes! After more than an hour on the phone with tech support -- he was slow, both in speech and in problem-solving -- we identified a form that had erroneous data in it (still not clear how it got there). After deleting the erroneous data and repeating the state calculations, the error would NOT go away. We finally came up with a solution ourselves, not the tech guy. But the federal return, which we had filed electronically two hours earlier, was no longer correct! We were offered no consolation or accommodation, only the option to book an in-office appointment the next day to address the error. Scheduling that took him another 5-10 minutes, and he couldn't even tell us if there would be charge for the appointment. We called the local office the next morning, were told there would be no charge, and they confirmed only the correction process we could take if the return was accepted. This took another 35 minutes on the phone but we cancelled the appointment. This return took over 8 hours of entry, hair-pulling, holding, fixing, and troubleshooting time, and would have taken less than 2 hours by paper. Done with H&R Block.
I selected the $500 gift card option when I filed my federal return. I received my refund and then received an email showing me how to get my gift cards. Only problem, the link in the email did not take me to the location needed to redeem or obtain my gift cards. I have spent at least 10 hours on the phone with H&R Block customer service trying to resolve the issue. I feel like a ping-pong ball. I keep getting bounced from one agent to another. Each of them promise to solve the issue, but none of them do. So I am out $500 of my federal tax refund. I think H&R are running some sort of scam which allows them to scoop up part of people's refunds. It is disgusting.
I made an appointment at my local H&R Block branch to do my taxes. I was planning on filing online with TurboTax for free, but I had a name change and lived abroad for part of the year, so just to make sure, I thought I'd go to get them done by a professional. I made an appointment online, after seeing hundreds of advertisements about the company filing taxes for $9.99. While at the appointment, after the woman had already done my taxes, she informed me that I owed $129. I asked about the price advertised on the website of $9.99 and she told me that the price was only if you file with them online. Nowhere in the advertisements did I see that, and I even went back to the site after my appointment to make sure that I wasn't mistaken. I wasn't. I couldn't find the disclaimer anywhere. While I'm happy with my refund, and the (somewhat charmless) service, I can't help but feel cheated. A number was advertised, and they did not stand by their advertisement. If I had known, I would have filed my taxes for free, since the accountant who filed for me never needed to ask any questions about my name change or my move.
First they didn't give us a list of their fees and we had NO idea they would be so expensive! $400! They didn't tell us this until after they did all our taxes! Now we are waiting for our return three weeks later. IRS says it should've been in our bank a week ago. Called H&R Block, they keep giving us the runaround. No one will give us a straight answer! I am very frustrated and angry! Never again! I have told all my friends and family as well!
I had a more complicated tax situation this year, so I decided to go to a tax professional. I went to H&R Block. Huge mistake. The decision nearly cost me $7,000. I am an individual, last year I purchased a home, I have a ROTH IRA. I was told I owed $7,000 in taxes. SEVEN GRAND. To me, it seems like if there is this high of a jump in someones tax history, and the situation seems clearly unusual and unexpected to the individual, the tax professional would do the research (any research) to determine the severe tax debt incurred. After leaving the office, nearly in tears, trying to figure out how I can cover this obscene amount of money that I owe, I started asking questions. I talked to my accountant friends, I called Charles ** who holds my Roth IRA all told me the same thing: H&R Block is WRONG. I went back to H&R Block to argue my case. I was told by the H&R representative that Charles ** was in the wrong, I would have to get a corrected 1099, and I would be charged $250 to file the amendment. I explained that Charles ** told me H&R Block could call them directly and they would explain my 1099 to them directly. Instead, my tax representative, clearly annoyed and doubtful, questioned an associate in the office. She then called her supervisor in another office and explained my situation. When she returned to me, she informed me that her boss laughed at my claims (customer service here was lacking. I was being MOCKED), and told me to wait. Fifteen minutes later (I was happy to wait), she approached me, tail between her legs, and said "turns out Charles ** was correct, we will fix the error". Everyone makes mistakes. But if my tax representative at H&R Block was to be personally charged $7,000, Im guessing she would have done a little more research into the situation instead of just handing me the bill and calling it good. If a tax situation arises that is unfamiliar to the accountant or is CLEARLY unexpected by the individual filing taxes, the tax representative should be trained to investigate, ask questions, do the research. Dont just deliver bad news and look the other way, hoping youre right. Think about the situation she was placing me in? What if I hadnt asked the right questions elsewhere? What if I would have trusted her entirely, taken a loan to pay the bill, gone in debt, or worse? My experience should be used as a training tool for your representatives in the future: ask questions if you are unfamiliar with a tax scenario and very simply do not belittle your customer when you may have to stand up to a mistake. Because of this aggravating and potentially damaging experience, I will NEVER go to H&R Block again. I will advise all of my friends, family, and associates to follow suit.
I had my taxes prepared by Mr. ** on 2/4/16 at the Bridge St. office in Weymouth Ma. First he is slow. He types using the hunt and peck method. Second, after he entered my papers into the computer, he said I would get more money back using the standard deduction. So he started over. He then charged me $282.50. Later I made a call and food out that a standard deduction is only about $100. I believe an experienced tax preparer would have told me that after sorting and reviewing my papers. I feel as if he did my taxes twice, and charged me accordingly.
Arriving at my appointment my tax advisor asked if it was ok for a trainee to sit in with us and I agreed. She made a remark she added an extra zero by mistake and had to reenter information which made me aware she might be distracted. My taxes were filed and I received a letter from the state correcting my return and made an adjustment on my refund deducting $40.00. I took a copy of the letter into their office. They said she would call me. My concern was not the mistake for 2015 because my income was a lot lower but for 2014. She filed it the same way and all I wanted to know was 2014 filed correctly. She finally called me and was rude. Stating "Its only $40.00." Again I expressed my concern for 2014 because I had to pay over $5000 in taxes that year and was worried if I was audited. She said she didn't know when the State had made a change to the disabled child exemptions and would get back to me. No call came so I left another message. Still no call... So she took my $215.00 prep fee, no apology, no call, no nothing. I have been using H&R Block for years and after this experience never, never again. I'm wondering for all their clients who have disabled children and use her, what is in store for them.
I had an appointment scheduled for 1:30pm on a Sunday with Rita **. I arrived at the H&R Block location and checked in with the receptionist at 1:20pm. I was asked to have a seat and told that Rita would be with me shortly. At 2:00pm, Rita came out into the reception area where I was waiting and apologized that she was running late. She explained that another worker was not in the office that day and that one of her clients had come in for help so she was assisting her. She went on to tell me, in detail, exactly what this person's tax problems were and how she was helping her which I thought was very unprofessional. I was left to wait for another hour after 2pm (hindsight 20/20 - I should have left), finally being called into her office at 3pm. When I finally did get to meet with Rita, she was, for lack of a better description, frazzled. Waving her hands incessantly, making decisions without knowing the facts, having to call someone on the phone and not being able to explain the situation because she did not gather all the facts. She sounded like a babbling fool! I ended up sitting in her office for another hour and a half while she searched the internet and talked with someone on the phone for about a half hour. Finally, I told her I had to go - by this time I had been there for over 3 hours! She asked me to leave all my tax files - from 2010 to present. I told her that I was uncomfortable doing that so she asked me for a copy of my husband's most recent pay stub which I provided to her along with my telephone number. I walked out extremely frustrated, wore out and with nothing done. She told me she would call me when she had more information on our tax situation and, to this date, 3 weeks later, I still haven't heard a word from her. Very, very unprofessional! I would never recommend her to anyone. She also stated several times during our meeting that I could do our taxes online and "it wouldn't cost nearly as much as I am going to have to charge you." Awful, awful customer service!
Overall very accurate. It asks a lot of questions to ensure the right information is entered. The ability to import W2s helps with your personal information accuracy. It costs around $76.00 to file both federal and state taxes. If your tax return is basic you can find a good accountant for about $60.00 to help. So you are really paying more for convenience. Let the questions guide you - it's that simple! I am hoping they keep all information confidential - one questions this with the upselling questions that happen throughout the preparation. Be careful of the "click to speak with a tax professional" buttons on these DIY tax preparation software - Let's just say from personal experience that I know one leading brand of software outsources its agents and they are not tax professionals nor are they accountants. Their focus is to get you to hit submit and pay for the filing and processing and have limited Tax training.
H&R Block has been great. Every year we use their software and it will look for possible tax credits. Last year they found us a tax credit I had no idea even existed and got us $2500. Very helpful, got more of a refund last year just by asking questions and offering suggestions. It tells you what information you need and where to find it. The program walks you through every step. We have never had any problems with our information being used or it falling into someone else's hands.
I tried using H&R Block's online system years ago, but it came out with numbers that I knew couldn't possibly be correct. I had student loans, annuitant pay from the DoD, and a W2 as well as property taxes (and I lived in a different state in which I worked). H&R Block always made me feel like my taxes were very complicated and each time I went they got "more complicated" and the price would always go up at the end. Did I mention that they don't give you their price till the end? The last time that I went I was dreading going, because they tend to shame me for things like not keeping up with my property taxes or trying to fill it out online first and failing so bad. I've had them laugh at me before. I've never paid more than $220 with them and I've always gotten back more, but two years ago when I went back to them they charged me $360 at the end because I had made $14 that year from mineral royalties on a $1099 misc. Their fees were more than my tax return. This place is essentially a scam. You can file online for free using TurboTax and they make it really easy and your numbers come out right. And even if you aren't comfortable filing it yourself, paying a personal accountant is going to be cheaper than H&R block most of the time. I'd even recommend Jackson Hewitt before H&R Block after my experiences.
Took out almost 400 in fees. Will never go back to this company. TurboTax is free. You can go on their site and do taxes for free. Stop wasting your money at H&R Block. They will not stand by their returns even if you buy peace of mind. I've known quite a few cases where they have not.
My 80-year-old mother's husband passed away in 2015. Her taxes were a little more complex than past years so per my recommendation, she took them to H&R Block in Anacortes WA. Long story short, when she went to pick up her taxes, they presented her with a $9000 tax bill and a $429 invoice for their services. Not knowing how to question the person responsible for doing her taxes, she just said, "I can't believe they are that much." The woman said, "well, your income went way up." Okay, that would have been a red flag to any knowledgeable tax person -- maybe something was wrong with the way her 1099's were coded or was there a reason why she had such a jump in income when she and her deceased husband were retired. The person didn't question the information. She just charged my mom the $429 fee and filled the taxes with the IRS. When I heard what happened, I call the office and was told by the women who did the taxes that she didn't really have time to review the taxes before my mom picked them up. I complained about her not questioning the return especially when she had my the information from my mom's last three years of tax returns, which substantially less than $9000 (more like $200). The woman transferred me to Gary **, the franchise owner. I told Gary ** the situation and that I'd like him to refund the $429 fee until we could review the return and figure out why the discrepancy. He said he couldn't do that. But if we could figure out the problem, they'd do an amendment free of charge. He said there was probably some coding errors in her 1099's -- my response, "why didn't they question that before filing the return." His response, "that's not our job, we are not the IRS." I've used CPA's to do my business taxes for years and they always question such huge discrepancies. Obviously, he just in it for the money and does not care about his clients. I put a stop payment on the $429 fee and will find a legitimate tax person to straighten this out along with calling the banks and financial institutes to correct the tax coding on the 1099s. My reason for writing this review is to hopefully stop anyone from using the Anacortes H&R Block office. I don't understand why they didn't question this situation and don't understand how they could take advantage of people like this. They were very unprofessional and don't seem to know what they are doing. Gary ** just wants his fee and doesn't care -- he was rude and could have cared less about doing the right thing.
I purchased H&R Block Tax Software as I had used in the past, but not in 3 years. I answered all the questions and entered all information accurately. The result was the software calculated I owed $4900 to the IRS. Since I've received a refund every year for over a decade, and there were no significant changes in my life, this was obviously wrong. So I printed off the necessary forms from the IRS website and filed the old-fashioned way, something I was experienced in doing, just was looking for an easier way. This resulted in a $2900 refund. H&R Block's Tax Software is screwed up! Don't buy it!
H&R Block advertises a free online federal return and $9.99 for a state return, but this not the case. In order to get this "product" you will have to first call and have them manually downgrade your return otherwise, you will have to pay a minimum of about $62 to file both. I find this to be completely deceiving and extremely inappropriate false advertisement. I just wasted an hour of my day and I am not very happy about it. So if you are expecting to pay $9.99 this is just a heads up... Call first or you will end up wasting time and money! Personally I prefer to work with an ethical company and won't be using H&R Block this year.
Jerel ** prepared my tax return. Jerel did a good job with the actual preparation. Jerel, however, failed to be transparent with fees by never telling me about additional fees that I would incur. My complaint is two-fold: (1) I paid two additional fees, both of which I had absolutely no knowledge, and (2) Jerel charged me for a service that I did not get. I discovered the fee only when my deposit was smaller than what Jerel told me my refund was and when my refund came from a bank, not from the IRS. (2) Jerel charged me for direct depositing my state refund, but my state refund came by mail. I paid this second fee (of which I had no knowledge), and I did not get the service. I filed a complaint with H&R Block, and I emailed the owner (Janet **) of the Race Street location in Searcy. The owner has not responded. The representative at H&R Block basically told me that I signed a contract. DO NOT use this location unless you find out about ALL FEES before signing. I have filed complaint with BBB, and I am in process of filing with other protection offices.
Nothing is free with them. They charged $195 for doing taxes and that includes the $34.95 for federal. So what is the other $160.05 for if the federal is covered and they just transfer the information from your federal form to your state form. It doesn't cost that much to do and I high recommend people avoid them. Going back to doing our own taxes or another tax preparer because they are a scams.
They were supposed to deposit my check into my account 3-5 days after the IRS deposited my check on the 10 - February they sent me an email so now it is 7 days later no deposit! I call the 800 number and they say they sent me a paper check!!! There was no email saying this. I am furious!!! I will never use H&R Block again!! All my friends used TurboTax for free and they all have their checks!!!
I wanted to try H&R Block first time since I called & I was told the cost is around $100. I want to get my tax done there. It took not longer than 30 minutes since mine is a very simple. Matter of fact it took longer to go over all the fine print than to do the tax. When she was done I get a bill of $420 dollars. I was shocked. When I asked, "Why is it so much?" I was told that is the cost. When I went to the front desk to pay the receptionist when she seen the bill she rolled her eyes back. I would never recommend anyone to them. It's a rip-off. Please stay away. I wouldn't send my enemies there.
We went in last Friday to get our taxes done. While sitting with the advisor I noticed she had put our rental home as a vacation home. I let her know that the house was rented out for the last twelve months and it was in no way a vacation home. Two days later we were at dinner and my husband said "Do you remember the advisor saying anything about my union dues?" So we opened up our taxes as well as last years to verify and realized she never added them to page 15 question 21 on form 1040 schedule A. We went in today for an appointment for an amendment and also to get our money back since H&R Block maximum refund guarantee states "We will get you the largest refund in which you’re entitled or it’s free." Well after waiting 45 minutes in the lobby because the advisor had told us the wrong time I got frustrated and made a scene and left. They showed little compassion or care that they were in the wrong and left us hanging. In all we lost close to $900.00 between paying almost $400 for preparation and a loss of close to $500 from doing our taxes wrong.
Something dodgy about H&R. Told me I owed my on my taxes. I rang them up they said it'll cost $210 for them to do it. I used Turbo Tax and I got a refund. I actually ended up going to an accountant, paid $150 and I got a refund. H&R you have lost my business. Overpriced, their software is hard to deal with, convoluted questions. It's like they are designed to trip you up; essentially you go to them for consultation.
I got an Emerald Advance on December 8th of 2015 for $900. They immediately took $45 fee out. On January 10 I made a payment of 36.35 which left a balance of $899.38 due on 2/15/2016. I filed my own taxes this year and had them deposited on to my Emerald prepaid card. The funds were deposited on 2/10/16. I immediately paid the balance of $899.38. Within an hour they had taken not only the $899.38 but an additional $919.15. Was told on 2/10/16 it would be back on in 2 business days. Called on 2/12/16 only $899.38 had been credited back. Was told the $19.77 would be on my card in 2 business days. It is now 2/17/16 and I am now being told it will take them 5 business days for them to call me back about it.
The Escalations Team is A JOKE! After filing my online taxes and they coming back rejected (even though the IRS says they never got it) There is a glitch in their software and yet, they won't fix it, and continue to blame ME! They told me they would fix it and guarantee to send it on 24/48 hrs after the override, to the IRS. Now 10 days later, I am STILL dealing with them. The lady in the local office said that this keeps happening and they have had people have to come in and file after the Online H&R Block has messed up everyone's taxes, promised to fix them, and never do. I am now out $78, (which I can't even reprint my online forms till I pay AGAIN) and now behind 10 days on my refund of over 6K. This is the last time I ever use H&R block. I have had it. They really need to fix the problems that they create. So disappointing.
I have been a loyal customer to H&R Block since I started filing taxes (9 years). In November of 2015 I received a letter from the Iowa IRS stating that I had to pay back $165 because there was a line 13 in my 2013 tax return that was not filled in like it should have been. I called H&R Block and told them about this and after admitting that it was their mistake I was told they would give me $20 off my filing next year (even though they charge me $300 - $400 to do my taxes every year!) and pay the INTEREST only on what I owe (about $12). I then had mentioned that I don't pay them $300 - $400 to do my taxes every year for me to have to pay for their mistake when they clearly advertise that they do taxes "100% accurate". I was then told "well ma'am if you would have paid for the protection plan we would have done your taxes with 100% accuracy" (WOW!!) So then I had mentioned that maybe they should advertise "we do taxes 100% accurate IF you buy the protection plan." I am still waiting for them to return my call on this matter. I will not be going back to H&R Block to do my taxes ever again, if I'm going to be paying for anyone's mistake it will be my own! None of my family will be going back to H&R Block either, so they have lost thousands of dollars worth of business every year from now on when they could have just simply paid the $165 mistake that they made, and I will also be contacting the Better Business Bureau regarding this issue.
I went to do an EZ form with H&R Block, which would cost me 84 dollars. After signing all papers Tova ** in Redmond Oregon said, "Oh I overcharged you 40 dollars," (more like $111 dollars) and offered me a $10 Subway card. Are you kidding me? I want my money that you scammed. I get a email saying my anticipation check is on my "Emerald Card". There was 5 cents!! I called the corporate yesterday and the guy I spoke too said, "Wow, I will get you the help you need" and I received a call this morning. The lady said, "We are sorry. But you signed the papers!" So I got reamed! Do not ever go to this place for your taxes. All you get is a lump of coal. I'm appalled that this place can rip you off with no care. Shame on you H&R block. Hope you sleep well while your pockets are full!!!
I went in yesterday to finish up filing my taxes. I go in with a $50 off coupon that one of my friends gave to me. He said he went in and only paid $50!!! I go in thinking that is a great deal! So I go in, sit down through the hell of a process and what do you know, my total was not pleasant! $177.00 for her to type CRAP into her computer!! I said, "Woah why is it so much?" and she continues to tell me it is because I had two different states on mine... yet I work with someone that also had two states on his and he tells me he only paid $100! I know $77 may not seem like much to them... but that is my hard earned money! I refuse to pass out these coupons or recommend anyone! Do your own taxes people! I did my boyfriend's but mine were a little more complicated and thought I would leave it to the "EXPERTS"! TurboTax is very simple and helps you through it! YOU CAN DO IT!!
I just gave them $300 cash to file my taxes injured spouse. I was told this is the best way to get my full refund due to my husband's issues. I was told it would take 1 month for my return when it will be more like 3 months. I got a letter today from the IRS saying there is a hold on my taxes. I took the letter back to H&R to have them fill out the letter since I don't know how, then I was told it would cost $20 for them to fill out the letter??? I feel I was lied to and scammed for the first time in my tax paying life. The worst thing about it is, the tax lady claims she has been doing taxes for 30+ years and she assured me that there would be no problem!
I went to get my tax prepared at H&R Block 19023 Mack Ave in Grosse Pointe Woods in the state of Michigan on February 16, 2016 and my tax preparatory name: **. Right for the start she was a TOTAL **! Asking questions was a big no no! When I ask anything about my W-2 or my taxes preparation I received nothing but anger and sarcasm, even from the first question! ** (tax prep) stated to me an incorrect balance of $1514.00 owed to the Federal Government in which she corrected after telling me "I did this to SHUT YOUR MOUTH!" After leaving I was truly SCARED AND CONFUSED! If you don't want this experience, STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!
I arrived at H&R Block only to take my simple tax return and turn it into a 2 hour wait sitting there and waiting for Jaunita ** a supposedly tax professional to file my tax return. Then to make matters worse she told me I needed to mail the tax form in. That I missed my deadline. Shouldn't I know this before or during? Ok fine, not a huge deal but not happy. 2 months later nothing. I go online irs.gov nothing. I call IRS nothing. I called H&R Block before and after calling IRS but nothing but, "Come in with your paperwork and we'll call." I finally had time to come in 4 months later so I did. I asked for my money back but was told they can't, only a manager can do that, she wasn't there. And they were too busy to call IRS. The only thing they could do is reprint my return and I can mail it again. I'm sorry but that's not acceptable.
I filed with them over thirty days ago and have not seen my refund. They are trying to blame the IRS yet my Son filed two weeks after me with tax act and had his refund in under a week. H & R Block will not call the IRS and all I get is a recorded message that they are still working on my return. This is my first and last time I will ever use their service again.
I paid for my Federal and State return to be completed. State was rejected due to H&R Block not having the correct form. So I filed my state taxes myself on the state tax site for free. When I asked H&R Block for a refund of the $36.99 they charged me for my state taxes they pretty much said I was out of luck even though it was their fault my return was rejected. They didn't have the forms to be filed. I was never told this ahead of time. I filed a complaint with the BBB. You truly have to watch them. BTW... You can file your state returns for free on your state of taxation website. Don't pay H&R Block $36.99. Plus you get the money direct deposited and back within 2 weeks.
Every time they charging too much for tax return. They are hopeless. This my last visit. Next time am going to look better tax return company. Last year they suck. VA rejected my tax and requesting missing document regarding that I made appointment in HR old bridge. I went, it was closed. A customer service reschedule to East Brunswick. I went, it was closed, like that 4 time I wasted my time. Finally, I got appointment in RT18 East Brunswick.
My fiancé has used H&R Block for several years now and this year we had to prepare a business partnership tax filing. Apparently the H&R Block down the street from us was not equipped to handle such filings. Therefore, they recommended we go to another H&R Block which was 20 minutes away, to have them file the Partnership filing. We called and specifically asked if they were equipped to help us with this type of filing we needed and they stated yes. We were lucky enough to get an appointment the same day and once we got there our preparer stated he did not know how to help us and that no one at the office could help us. It was extremely disappointing and caused us to not use H&R Block ever again. It was a waste of the day! Very, very disappointing.
H&R Block is a scam and very rude and sneaky. They try and not tell you what they are going to charge. They took 50 percent of my gf tax money. Why should they get half of the money she worked all year for and in 15 minutes they get half? Not right and then when we tried to do something about it the lady said "Oh well there is nothing we can do. This is your problem not our problem." and my gf is a full time student and everyone else in her class received a school credit for 800 to 1000. The person she went to at H&R Block told her it wasn't worth it for her because they would charge her more money than she would get back. After doing more research about it we found out she should have received 900 for her school credit. They are very unprofessional and have no idea what they are doing. So if you want to get robbed then go there. If you don't want to get robbed do not go to H&R Block. She is getting back only 400. It was only a part time job and it was a very simple form. She got charged 215 out of getting back 400 - that is not fair. Do not go there.
Had more than one W2 this year, plus after speaking with the geniuses at the Healthcare.gov website and being bullied by an $800 penalty that may or may have not been looming over my head, I decided not to use TurboTax this year and go to our local H&R Block. The commercials all scream "$9.99 taxes!" and they claim you can win $1000 dollars. Well after a whopping 20 minutes, I found out that not only did I not need the tax form for my insurance I was told I needed, I was not winning $1000 dollars. And oh yeah, I owed them $250 dollars for a tax return I could have done online for free. THIS PLACE IS NOTHING MORE THAN A FRAUD FOLKS. SCAM. Never again. The woman could have told me ahead of time what it was going to cost but decided to rather take my money.
I received a notice from the IRS that I needed my 2012 Taxes Re-done. To make a long story short, I called this company, talked to a rep about the cost. She said at first, around $45 if it was a simple tax return. So I could tell from the very beginning that she was not familiar with the software. She kept saying, "I can't find this, and why doesn't this work when I push the button," and so on. At the end of this session, I had to pay for a 1040X (amended) which was $120, and I had to pay $274 for a copy of my 1040 which the IRS didn't have, because it was never (PDF version) filed by TURBO Tax online software AND they lost the data, or so they say. So what I have learned from this experience is.... learn how to do your own taxes. I will be taking the IRS Tax class 2016.
I have been an H&R Block customer for the past 5 years. The employees have always been kind and professional. Last year it cost me $91 to have my taxes filed. I am a student and make less than 20k a year and the cost was worth not having to deal with the forms. THIS year however, I had to pay $244! I thought the employee was joking when she told me what I owed her. I have no idea what changed between this year and past years, but this business has become a rip-off. I left the building with my tax return cut in half - a huge blow to someone in my position at the moment. I will never go back to H&R again. Do your own taxes; an hour or two of paperwork is worth getting to keep your own money.
I went to the office at 3440 E silver springs Blvd in Ocala Fl. on 2/10/16 and met with **. I asked for a quote on what it would cost to complete my Federal tax return for 2015. She said come into my office and let me look over your information. After doing so she said $100 to $125 dollars and said, "Shall we do them?" I said yes. 45 minutes later she completed the return and said my bill was $375 dollars. I reminded her of her original quote and she said there was nothing she could do about it. When I said I was not willing to pay that much she tore up the return she had completed and sent me on my way. What a dishonest way to do business...
This is the WORST H&R Block office I've ever dealt with. They are ALL going downhill past few years as far as customer service goes, but this one is by far the worst. They made so many mistakes on my tax return, and I ended up owing Federal for the first time in 25 YEARS. When the manager refiled my taxes to fix the first woman's mistakes, I ended up owing even MORE. She told me I must've given her the wrong information LMAO! HOW?? It's all right in front of them on my documents. She even made a rude comment to me for having more than one W2, saying maybe I will stick with one job so next year I will only have one W2??? Not only that, my state return was rejected TWICE due to HER failing to submit the proper forms, as well as the IRS withdrawing from my checking account what I supposedly owed them WITHOUT MY AUTHORIZATION. Their excuse was that the IRS shouldn't have been able to do that and they do not know what happened. When I called corporate, MARIO assured me I would receive a refund of the $165 filing fee within 10 days, due to the MISTAKES and DISRESPECTFUL COMMENTS made by this office. A week later when I called to find out where that refund was, the RELATIONS department told me they don't know why MARIO told me that since he has no authorization to do that. So not only does H&R Block provide TERRIBLE customer service on all levels, they have ZERO PEOPLE SKILLS and always pass blame onto someone else. Their "guarantee" is a JOKE and is something they do not HONOR. As a 25 year customer, I REFUSE to ever deal with this incompetent company ever again. CROOKS!
Do not do file taxes with these people. Total frauds. It's been 21 days. I still haven't received nothing from them. They add unexpected fees with filing. Should of stayed with TurboTax.
Yesterday I called H&R Block's customer hotline. First off I was on the phone for over an hour, transferred to 3 different departments all for a simple answer. They took 1000 from me unexpectedly for what they said was something 9 yrs old. I've never received a letter, a phone call, an email regarding this matter. When I filed nothing came up as a disclaimer or warning. I'm all for paying your debts but not in the way they go about it. My husband thinks something is odd about this. One customer service rep couldn't find my name in the system, one seemed shocked I'm calling but don't have one of those emerald cards, finally the last one answered my questions. If I had even remotely had any idea this would have been paid. Like I said I'm all for paying debts but after this many years I've never thought about it. They should do a better job collecting first. My number has not changed and I've been in the same house 8 yrs, that's another thing this "debt" isn't on my credit, never has been.
I use to do my taxes on my computer, but choose H&R when my computer went down. They told me the price and I asked them to take it out of my refund, they took $300.00??? I should of got on this website before I chose them. I will make it a point to tell as many people as I cannot go to H&R Block. You should be ashamed of yourself. I can't believe you are still in business?
First year using H&R Block and will NEVER USE THEM AGAIN! They charged me $300 dollars to get refund faster with this emerald card and told me two weeks! Here I am four weeks later with nothing! My friends used TurboTax and got their refunds back in one week! I just don't understand what I paid the $300 bucks for exactly when it's taking as long as a paper check would! Now I'm really getting worried because I just came across this site and am learning that this is happening to a lot of other people! Someone needs to do something! This isn't right!
H&R block promotes that they have free file and return for federal and also 9.99 for state (1 per state). Now the thing with this is I was doing my taxes under their tab right from their main web page. I had very simple taxes. Just 3 w-2s with no 1099 (self-employment form) and I also had my 1095 form to avoid penalty. As I was going through my taxes they wanted to charge 36.99 for state and 26.99 for federal. Now I understand if you own homes, have Investments, dependents, I have none of those. What the heck was the difference in me doing it myself and paying someone to do it. I got absolutely no benefit from doing it myself besides wasting time. The fee should have been 9.99. I called customer service and the representative was very nice but he is a robot in what he can do. This is the truth. The rep actually told me once I informed him it seemed misleading he informed me that he has been getting calls about it frequently. And he also stated to me that you could always go file with another company that does not have those fees to save yourself some money. Now I could have done that but I spent an hour and a half on H&R block so I did not want to go through the process all over again with a different company. But I learned my lesson. I will be using someone else next tax season. H&R block thanks for taking more money than you should have. Late Christmas for you!
They made an error filing my 2014 Taxes. Filed me as Head of Household, IRS caught the mistake and are asking for $2171 back. H&R Block are being very slow honoring Peace of Mind Contract, looking more like I will be taking them to Small Claims & purchasing Turbo Tax.
I have used H&R Block for years whenever I needed taxes done. The prices were decent in the past, but the past few years the amount I'm paying for taxes keep going up. In 2014 alone, I made no money yet to do my taxes still cost over $400. Then, I get something from the state about failure to file some returns. I pay for the peace of mind. And now H&R Block wants to charge me for those forms, even though at a reduced fee, renders the peace of mind you buy - that they offer - useless. I used to be a fan of this company, but they have become a company that is all about the money and raping people's wallets is something they will do with a smile on their face. Not funny in the least bit, as it just shows more greedy people trying to make an extra buck - who don't care if they retain customers. Which is a terrible business practice. Once I have some things wrapped up, I will never be using H&R Block again after that in the future. Their peace of mind just ends up being a piece of crap - just like their respect for their customers.
Usually do my own taxes online. Went to office for preparation last yr. & this yr. due to starting social security & not quite sure of how to address Obamacare issue. Last yr. feel I was charged a fair price to have my taxes filed. This year I feel I have been ripped off. First, preparer made prep as difficult as possible. Had everything for prep ready except for a form I didn't realize I needed from the marketplace, that I hadn't received yet. As soon as preparer looked at my paperwork, told me I didn't have enough to itemize with. Ok. So easy 1040. Then, after everything had pretty much been prepared, we came to the healthcare form which I hadn't received yet. I made the mistake of asking the preparer if they knew who I should contact re: the form. Big mistake. The preparer pulls out the cellphone & starts making a dozen phone calls. All the while I am saying "It's not that urgent, I would bring it as soon as it arrives". This went on for about 20 mins. until preparer finally got tired, & agreed the process indeed needed to be on hold till form arrived. As luck would have it, the form in question was in the mail when I got back home so took it immediately back to office. Taxes (no itemizations, etc.) were completed. I was then asked if I wanted the "peace of mind protection". Now as a longtime H&R Block online user I thought that rather strange because H&R Block has always had a policy of backing up their work in an audit but said ok. Nothing was mentioned about a fee. Then was asked of course about my payment. I said I intended to use my bank card. Then preparer started telling me that I could pay later & asked for my bank acct. no. & routing no., saying they could just set up an acct. with my bank to remove their fee from my return when it was direct deposited. Now, I really didn't want to do it that way but was pretty much pressured into it. Gave her my acct./routing no. & computer kept kicking out the routing no. My bank had changed names since I got my last checks. So. preparer asked me to call my bank & get the new no. I started to do it but then hung up & again told the preparer that I would pay with my card. Preparer grabbed cellphone again, asked me which branch I use, called my bank & set up the "payment" to them when my refund arrived. Not once was there any mention of a "green card" or loan. So, for a simple 1040 to be done, I've been charged $289+ because the process was made much worse than necessary by the preparer, & because there wasn't any mention of a refund loan (green card), to take their money out when my refund arrives, or a fee for the "peace of mind". This kind of manipulation & deception by omission should be illegal.
I went to H&R Block to file my taxes. Went through my federal. Fine no issues. Told them I wanted to do the refund anticipation check and emerald card. They said no problem. When doing state of MD I have my Firefighter papers that give me a 3500 dollar credit. Along with that I claim mileage and uniform. She couldn't put in my credit in the system. Told me even with the credit my refund was only 300 dollars. I said absolutely not.. My tax refund for state is always minimum 800. She called "tech support". They said it was a known problem and they told me to put my state taxes on hold and they would call me when it was fixed but they didn't have a approximate date of when it would be fixed. I asked if I had stupid on my forehead and said no. They then said to take my state taxes to a state office and they would file my taxes by paper for free. Again I said no. All this was way too shady. Then they said they would do my federal still. Then she said I would have to be charged an additional 499 dollars because I have a 10-99 for 58 dollars because it's technically my own business because I drove for Uber. I told them to delete everything, give me my papers and I would go elsewhere.
I am so frustrated!!! I have used H&R Block for the last 5 years. I used it this year and for the first time, it wouldn't let me go any further until I selected either send it to a "Tax Professional", choose my own or something else but I had to choose an option to have someone to look at it before I could submit it!! I chose the option "use someone they refer" to use which was a lady who worked at a H&R Block right up the street. It said she will get in touch with me in 72 hours. It's been 120 hours!! I decide to call the office where she works, where H&R block referred me to only to find out that she has not "reported" to the office this tax season so my taxes has been sitting in LIMBO for days!!! Then the receptionist says, "I will have my office manager call you as soon as she finishes up with a client." That was 3 hours ago. I am just so frustrated!!! How do I get my taxes back and use another website!!! UGH... UGH... UGH!!
I have been out of work because I work construction and it is bad weather. My bills were stacking and I filed some taxes from a few years ago. Well I didn't know it cost out of pocket... there was no way I could pay. They chipped in to help me pay. This may seem small to you but this is my first experience where a business showed concern for its community. It was a true blessing... Thank you to the staff at Kiefer Sacramento.
My wife and I did our taxes online with H&R Block not knowing the price. At the end, it was $20 tax filing and $35 if you want them to back you in an audit. $55. Not cheap, but okay. My wife gets an email today and they took $180 in fees out of a small refund. Also, no recourse. Be aware. Lesson learned. That won't happen again and I will make it a point to tell as many as I can of my experience. I reported this on my phone but I have proof of these facts.
A representative of H&R Block filled in an income tax return for 2015 and made a huge error by not filling the box 66 of a t-4 which resulted in a huge re-assessment from Revenue Canada. Now the client has to pay $7,000.00 which she does not have. She is on a pension and she has been a Canadian citizen who worked and paid into an old age pension plan. Revenue Canada will take her CPP if this is not paid inside two year period. It is outrageous and I think unfair. They are treating immigrants better than citizens. H&R Block are FRAUDS and they will not stand behind their ad which states guaranteed 100% satisfaction, and the CEO saying "we do the right thing" after a few phone calls to them and no results to fix the problem. MANY PEOPLE ARE IN THIS HOPELESS SITUATION. I THINK THAT WE SHOULD ALL GET TOGETHER AND FIGHT THEM. Maybe sign a petition and send it to AICPA. It does not matter if you are Canadian or U.S. residents. Send me an e-mail at **.
I went to H&R Block for the first time because someone referred me to them. I was told that they were cheaper than doing them on TurboTax. I was charged over $200 to file two tax returns. That is just ridiculous when I can go onto TurboTax and done it for about $60 or $70. I was not happy at all and I will never EVER go to them again!
I've been dealing with these people for about 3 years and this year they are deciding to lag around with my refund like it never took 3 weeks just to process. Not only that like it haven't made it to the second stage yet. I have tried to call the IRS but only to just get the automated service. IDK what to do anymore.
I was told I had I had past delinquent debt with them for an emerald advance line of credit, as everyone knows, comes right out of your refund. I called the number, 3 different managers told me that no debt was found, and closed my claim. I filed my taxes because I was told everything was fine, just to find out a week later that they are keeping my return, no phone call... nothing. I called H&R block again to find out, now I have a debt, but can't tell me from when. Now, no refund and no answers. Don't deal with this company. They are frauds!!!
I was told that I could not claim my 18 yr old that just graduated from high school. Not sure how this can be when I provide more than half of her care. She lived with me all year and is not yet 19. Yet they charged me over $250 for this. I am having to get someone else to fix this problem meaning I'm out even more money. Thanks H&R Block.
As a new customer after having a CPA for a few years, I chose HR Block Cohasset Mass. to do my taxes this year. Expecting to save a few dollars from the $250 for the CPA, my bill came to $288. Not only was unhappy with the price but I got a new recruit that had to ask questions to others every other thing. Not a warm and fuzzy feeling for having my taxes done correctly. She was very pleasant but needed much help to complete my simple taxes (retired, no house and schedule A to itemize). An hour and half which should have taken 1/2 hour. I could have done a better job. Next year I'll do my own.
I have used H&R Block for about 25 years. But NEVER again. I never used them because of anything they did, simply because they were there and had my info and it was easy. After 25 years, this time I had to give them all of my info again. But that isn't the reason I'm never going. Preparing my taxes couldn't have been easier this year. I should have done it myself but was in need of a "rapid refund" (apparently those don't exist anymore). All my tax preparer needed was my W2, I had no write offs, no deductions, I have no children, no property, nothing. BUT... (and I'm ashamed I never knew this before) their FEES are not set, they charge according to what you are getting back! If you are getting more money back, they charge more... i.e.- if you make more money they screw you. This is bogus. It shouldn't be legal. Again, I am disgusted with myself for using them for so many years without recognizing this. NEVER NEVER NEVER AGAIN. H&R BLOCK I HOPE YOU ARE READING THIS!
So after 4 yrs with H&R Block I was excited to get my 5th yr free... I guess not. They told me the owner sold the company? Don't care who did what I deliberately used this company to get my 5th yr free. I've been waiting 5 yrs to be told "I'm sorry sir, we're no longer doing that promo". I want my free return. I'm going to make sure my family no longer files with this overpriced company...
Their website indicates one price then has you pay something completely different. I feel like this happens every year and it is my fault for continuing to use them, but this year was the worst. I did the basic free and it was over $70.00. I just want to make sure anyone who uses them thinking it does not cost or will only cost the $9.99 for the upgrade understands that by the end of filing you can owe anywhere from $50-$250 to them, and going into the office cost even more. The IRS website now allows you to do a free e-file tax return, I think I will switch to this next year.
Completely screwed up my taxes. Office apologized and told me to file a claim to get a refund of the interest and penalties. Corporate office denied it and sent me on a wild-goose-chase for over a year. I am now into 5 figures of debt. Thanks to H&R Block. STAY AWAY!
I have been filing with H&R Block for the past 4 years. Never have I waited so long for my refund. I filed in office on 1/20/2016. Received an email that the irs accepted return on 1/22/2016. I have yet to receive a ddd. My refund is loaded to an emerald card. I called the emerald card today. Was told I should have my refund on or before the 12th of February. They stated that is what the irs has told them. I also called the irs to try to get a peace of mind that there are no problems with my return. I had no luck with them. Was told to call back once it has been 21 days. I called the H&R block office where I filed my return to see if they had an information about my return or refund. They said nothing has come back wrong. So my question is where is my refund? I see so many people that have filed a week or less ago getting their ddd or their refunds. I cannot get any questions answered anywhere. This is being very frustrating. We pay all this money to H&R block to file our returns but when questions arise they cannot give any answers. I will not be filing with them again in the future.
Used their DIY software program. All information was entered correctly. Unfortunately due to a software problem, it did not carry information over to the actual 1040. This resulted in an underreporting of income. 25 calls later I was sent to one of their local offices to amend the return; it was done incorrectly which is resulting in even greater fines to the IRS. H&R Block does NOT back their product & their support is non-existent.
H&R Block not advertised as offering tax services for $9.99, when you actually prepare your taxes through this company they do not honor the prices they advertise. I have been doing my taxes myself online for 12 years now, and this is the first year that I have ever had a problem, as well as the first year that I used H&R Block. I paid more with them than I have ever paid in the past for a grand total of $65.00. The IRS did not accept my refund for days and I still have no idea when I am to receive my refund. After the horrible experience I had with H&R Block I used TurboTax to help my assistant, the IRS accepted hers the same day and has already received her refund! Never Ever Ever Again will I use this bait and switch company. They are supposed to be the experts however the only expertise I found them to have is how they can take your money and ensure that you will be waiting for weeks for a refund compared to everyone else getting it within a week.
I'm retired, have a part time job and used H&R Block last year. They advertise a simple free service. To get the information from last year isn't free. To have them look at my social security income is required by them and isn't free. The IRS requires information from last year's submitted form, that costs money. I can't electronically file because H&R Block charges a fee for the info. Hoped they liked my money because I will never use them again and will tell everyone I know what dirtbags I consider them to be. Is it really necessary to lie to take money from an old man who barely makes enough to eat?
Since my email acct was compromised by a hacker I went to my HR Block acct to change my email address and password. After doing so, HRB sent an email to my old address but instead of just sending a notification email like most companies do (which alerts the customer to acct change activity but does not include any acct info) their email included my new email info and my username!!! Thanks for giving the hacker my new address as well as a username I use for other accts. And oddly, they included the new security questions I chose (but not the answers of course) but why even add that? Why? I understand the need to send this alert email to the old address in case of fraud but there is no need to send the other info!
This year's H&R Block Deluxe software really BITES!!! They have all these dropdown boxes and you really need to know exactly where to find them and if you don't... You'll be like me filing a 1040 X amendment and getting your refund much later and probably even getting audited because they changed the landscape of their software and made it NOT Taxes For Dummies like me! Then you try to call Block and get them to help you and 1 HR later they remind you, it's not their fault and it IS DIY software so it's really your fault! No refund nor even a kiss after being so totally screwed!!! I have used Block for years, but now I will never be BACK!!! BUYER BEWARE!!!
I got my taxes done at my local H&R Block office on 1/19. Not only did my information get entered wrong multiple times but I got a phone call from them 4 days later says they did something wrong and asked a bunch of questions over the phone and then sent in my taxes. I got my state taxes back and they took all of it for their fees off my card. My fee was 230 dollars and my refund was 692 dollars and they took all of it. After going there for 17 years I will not go back.
I called H&R customer service to see if they covered form 1099-r which was not covered by another online preparer. They said it was covered and we started to do my granddaughter's taxes. Got 3 w2's entered and 1099-r entered and 1098-T entered. They checked and said she qualified for EIC but we would have to upgrade for approx $30 to get it. TurboTax which did not cover the 1099-r also wanted to upgrade for about $30. Seems they all try to get you started and then find a reason you have to upgrade. We will try OLT which has a list of forms and all we need are listed.
I visited H&R Block in 02/01/1016 to see if they could review my taxes which I filed with an online software. I was asked to bring a copy of my taxes in and they would look over it. When I returned with the paperwork, another woman said "Oh they do not look at taxes filed with other softwares." I told her the previous woman did not tell me that and in fact, she told me she could look at it. With an attitude, she said "Come on to the back." Her first question was, "You want H&R Block to look over these for free?" I said well I just need to make sure I filed correctly because I had done it myself. Anyways, she goes to say H&R Block has their own software and website and that I only owed the IRS a minimal amount so what was the issue? I was confused because I never owed any money! Her entire tone was rude and she was very sarcastic. She pretty much said if I owed, I owed! I just wanted clarity on why I owed and what I could do to not owe next year. This was my first experience with this company and it will be my last!
Filed our 2015 taxes at H&R Block like we have done every year since 2006. This year we got an older guy - he was randomly clocking things, leaving things unanswered, I had to correct him a few times. Now our tax return needs further review. The amount you pay to have them prep your refund, I would assume they would do them correctly.
All over the web H&R Block is advertising $9.99 Taxes. I thought that was great, I was going into the office before that until I realized each year they tacked on another $100. Anyways, while I was online getting my taxes done, thinking I would only pay $9.99, they said to ACTUALLY file my taxes would require going to the $79.99 package if I wanted to take any form of tax deductions (and I mean the really simple ones they offer up easily)... OK... So I did. Oh, that package doesn't cover filing your state, even though the advertisement CLEARLY shows that you can file your state for free. So add on another $36.99. Want your taxes to be Direct Deposit rather than a check? That's $34.99 BANK FEE. Somehow, what I originally thought would be a $10 to $40 MAX turned into somewhere in the ballpark of $150... which is the amount I was paying to go see them in person 3 years ago.
We have been going to H&R Block for the past 5 years. For the past couple of years we have had some sort of problem with a certain tax preparer. The problem, last year this certain preparer did not explain nor take the time to show us our own information on the different screens. This last year we had to go have our taxes amended because she left out a child after we told her who to add. When I went in to do this she said it was my fault and they wanted to charge me for the amendment. Needless to say I did not pay this fee. My husband became upset and walked out of this particular tax preparation. Despite of that we decided to come back and ask for a different preparer. After sitting in the waiting room for almost 3 hours we got the preparer we wanted. She was very polite and we were very pleased with her service. Close to the end of our session the general manager Justin came up to my husband and asked him to come into his office. He proceeded to ask him about the incident that had happened. My husband told him about the incident and Justin proceeded to talk to my husband in a not so nice manner. My husband told him to come and talk to me about it but he wouldn't. Yes, my husband did raise his voice and used words that shouldn't have been said. But why ask us about something that happened 1-2 years prior? I asked my husband to stop telling and I also asked the general manager to stop. He wouldn't. He told us he didn't need customers like us in his establishment. I myself told our tax preparer that it was nothing she did. I had to take what paperwork we had left to sign outside. I will NEVER go back to H&R Block in Weston nor will I refer anyone I go there.
Never had any problems with the tax preparation by H&R Block. You can do a walk-in or make an appointment. We usually just walk in and there has never been much of a wait. I think the charge is well worth the peace of mind that we get from having them do our taxes. We have used accounting firm before and the cost is very high. Walk-in or make an appointment. Several staff working and the wait time is very short. Everyone has always been courteous when we have gone in. Feel quite confident that our information is secure... Have never had any problems and have been going there for the last 5 years...
These individuals spend a lot of time in class learning the tax laws which make them extremely accurate and up to date each year with tax laws. They make recommendations going forward for future tax savings and make sure you get all the deductions available to you every year so that you save on taxes. It is easy to work with this tax preparer. I have used others that are not as helpful or as up to date and accurate in the past years and have not been happy with results. Excellent security. You can purchase additional security from them so that you have security for the year following your current year tax input.
Our taxes were very simple, however, charges were applied. Can't verify the accuracy. I've heard nothing from IRS so all must be okay. I just don't like hidden fees. Our taxes were very simple, however, charges were applied. Can't verify the accuracy. I've heard nothing from IRS so all must be okay. I just don't like hidden fees. Easy enough to complete and our taxes were very simple so there were no challenges. Nothing to rave about but can't complain. Going back to our original tax person(s)/company this year. Seems secure but hard to tell nowadays. I really have nothing else to say about the security involved with this company although prior to their online services they were always pretty good.
Have never experienced a problem with this tax software. Seems to calculate correctly and is very comprehensive with allowed input. There are built in checks at the end of the process to ensure accuracy. Much better value than TurboTax. Includes schedules C and D without upgrading to a more expensive version. I switched from TurboTax to H&R Block 2 years ago due to value. It's very intuitive. You can deviate from the standard step through process if you want focus on special areas of income or deductions. There is online help available.The software is encrypted so I have no concerns regarding security. I have never experienced issues while using H&R Block software. The program finds current updates automatically.
Well designed and complete, but complicated because of stupid laws in the tax changes over many years. At least the computer tells me it is complete, but I have no time to find any errors that may occur from the program. The charges are less than the cost of my time doing it by paper or any other procedure I am aware of. Also there will be less likely mistakes from my lack of understanding the stupid rules. There is nothing about any recent tax plan that is simple. It is designed by years of additions to trick you into paying more money when you do not have time to figure out what it is really used for. I have no idea whether it is secure or not, and don't care much anyway.
H&R tax preparation online was quite easy for me to use. The language used was down-to-earth and this made the directions much easier to follow. Actually, since using this tax preparation, I will continue to use H&R online every year. Honestly, I cannot recall what the original cost for the disc was. However, I do know that I saved a great deal of money by not having to go to an H&R office to have the personnel do this for me. As I stated previously, all the directions were brief and to the point. If not, there were several ways to have them explained for additional information. Also, when completed, the program will scan and check for errors or other unsure entries. The security of this tax preparation disc is only as secure as the program you have installed on your computer. H&R also guarantees that the information you have entered will also be safe with their security systems.
The questionnaire makes it hard to know what to put in. Very frustrating since it can make you think things are deductible that aren't. So while the calculations are accurate, the software encourages a user to add bad info. No very expenses, but states are extra, which can add up fast if you file in more than ones state. Also, printing copies for other purposes (like for a loan application) isn't easy, so it feels like it should work more easily to be a good value. Too structured, tough if you have a clue what you are doing. I don't like having to follow the long lines of questions, when I know what to put in where and just want to enter it. Honestly, if you are that clueless that you need such a tool, you should not be doing your own taxes. I don't know of any security problems with this software. However, it doesn't utilize advanced options like dual authentication, which would make me rate it higher than I did.
I use the software myself & have work experience with IRS. There's nothing left to guess here. Been doing my own taxes since I was a teenager & now I'm retired. Most of the time I use H&R Block because they cut the bells & whistles & get down to the facts I did with above mentioned employer. I only use the online method. The price is nominal & most of the time it's tax deductible. Software is not expensive & I usually choose the long form because I itemize & review all questions whether they concern me or not. I have a lot of background knowledge and work experience with taxes. I'm just good with money. I know the so called equations, so it is easy for me. If someone doesn't know terminology, a bit of tax law, math etc. it's going to present a small to moderate level of difficulty for them. You are given an option of using a PIN with your information & there are security questions & things you need to know before accessing your returns & refund status & preparation.
I checked the Maryland state form in advance which was very complicated. I filed my state taxes at two other sites. H&R Block was the only site that accurately calculated my return. The other sites were confusing. H&R Block had the easiest site to navigate. The state tax was cheaper than elsewhere. I can't believe I got my federal and both states filed for the price. I thought it was a great deal. Some of the questions regarding the State income tax could have been a little clearer. There was some confusion regarding income tax paid to other states if you lived in one and worked in another and whether or not I could take the deduction. I was still able to figure it out. Other sites were much harder. H&R Block had the most information available while filling out the forms. Some of it was still slightly confusing. I had to file as a partial resident for two states. Some of the verbiage was a little confusing. Still it was better than TurboTax and TaxSlayer. I switched from Taxslayer and will be using H&R Block from now on.
The accuracy rate for H&R Block is very high. Been doing business with them for over 15 years. I haven't had any issues with the IRS regarding problems or mistakes in my tax filing. Besides, H&R Block has a clause stating if there was a problem they I'll correct it but you to pay for it if the IRS finds an error. The overall value is good. I trust and value their opinions for my tax filing needs. Since tax rules can change yearly they know and stay on top of all the latest tax rules which makes me feel comfortable knowing they are trying to make sure I get money back. H&R Block ease of use is great. I understand everything and it's easy. I don't have to fumble and guess what's going on. It's clear as day and makes filing taxes so easy and simple. I rate H&R Block security very high. Since I've been doing business with them for many years I feel comfortable about my privacy with them. Their security is very important to me knowing that I can trust them with my personal information and not having a problem down the road with identity theft.
It is only as accurate as the data I input. Sometimes it is difficult to find an accurate answer to a question on some data that you might want to use. It seems expensive for something that you can do yourself for free. However, it is convenient and is more likely to find errors. The several options for buying the software or using the software online sometimes makes it difficult to decide which to use. I have found that I have purchased a level that I did not need but when I have tried to save money I have often had to move up a level. There is also the question of what they charge to file electronically. Sometimes it is included in the price and sometimes not. I can usually do my taxes in much less time using the software as long as I have all the information that I need at hand. I have used the H R Block tax prep software for at least 20 years so it does have a lot of my information at hand. It is probably the one reason I have not switched to another company. Last year a bogus tax return was filed in our names early in the year. I am too sure where they got their information. I don't think it was from the software as they would have done a better job. Basically they filed a simple form (which we have not used for years) and provided no backup. It meant that we could not file electronically last year. Hopefully we can this year.
My wife and I have filed our taxes for 7 years with the additional peace of mind $$ in case the IRS finds a problem with our filings, then H & R would back us and cover any discrepancies. My wife's sister just had the IRS audit her after 4-5 years and found that a w2 form for $2,500 was missed as it stuck to the back of another statement. H & R missed it, then stuck to the peace of mind, which in small print, STATES "IT IS ONLY VALID FOR 3 YEARS" What??? H & R told her that it is past the 3 years, now she has to pay the IRS $2,500. Manager even lied to me that she signed a statement that she did not include it in her taxes, Shame, shame. IRS can audit you for up to 7 years, everyone knows that. We will never deal with H & R block again.
I have not used H&R Block for several years and I know why now, and have no intention on ever going back. I normally take my taxes to a CPA, that I have used for several years and was very pleased with. I thought I would do something different this year (bad mistake). I made an appt. at 9am on 01/31/2016 in Lewisburg WV. My tax person started putting in my W-2's. I had a total of 5, 4 was from WV, and 1 was from VA. It took her approx. 15 minutes to put them in. I thought good. Nope! It all went downhill from there. My tax person was not knowledgeable at all(!!) about VA forms, she called over a 2nd person that didn't help. I only made 1898 (VA wages) she was saying I owe VA tax of 1424. I told her that was incorrect. How can I make only 1898 and I owe 1424. Common sense says that's wrong. I waited so long. I told her I'll just take it to my CPA. She said "No I'll get it." I ask how much this would cost she said it will tell me at the end. The second person came over and told her "Just print them out and let her mail them in", and the problem hadn't even been fixed at that point. At this point I've already been up 16 hrs because I work 12 hr shifts at a hospital. My tax form was very simple no deductions. My tax person after 1 hr and approx. 10 minutes decided to call another person at another office to help her with the VA tax problem. She kept saying "I'm sorry, I'm sorry." I told her I should be compensated for some of the tax cost, she stated there was a form for that but- she could not do that because they had none at that office. Then I got the surprise it cost me 175.00 for doing a simple tax preparation, no deductions or that would have cost me more. She then started trying to staple the forms to the book. I had to point out to her she was out of staples. The second person came over on a couple of occasions and interrupted her while she was trying to do my taxes. After this experience I tend to agree with the other comments people have made. It is in my opinion that H&R employees are not knowledgeable at all about all the forms they should. Their cost for preparing a simple tax return is an outrage. Their cubicles, are too close confidential info is being heard. I can hear the people's conversation next to me. And the worst part was those people live in the same town as me. And we both work in the health field. I sit there for an hour and a half, drove 1 hour and 30 minutes total, only to get frustrated and lose more sleep than I should have. This will never happen again. I have learned my lesson along with other people. Goodbye H&R Block.
I have been with H&R Block since 2001 and trusted them every year, but next year I definitely will be going elsewhere. My husband and I moved from North Carolina to Florida within the last year and we were expecting a decent return this year. Our tax specialist didn't even know what she was doing and had to get help with the computer system several times. She seemed lost, confused and not very confident with what she was doing, needing to say the least we didn't feel confident either. When she finally finished, it was not what we were expecting. We had made the exact same amount as last year and nothing else had changed besides the move and our return dropped 2k. Every year I had paid no more than 130$ and they charged us almost 300$ this time. We'd like to get a second look at our return, but since they robbed us blind we can't afford it. Please try and do your taxes online or go somewhere other than H&R, or you'll get ripped off. Hopefully no one else experiences what we did. H&R you are a disgrace!!!
I went to H&R Block after looking on the internet to see if they had any offers to get my refund the same day. They had two options, the Emerald Advance and refund anticipation check. I went there and told the man "I was here because of needing my return today." He did my return, I signed it and he showed me the price was $327.00, part of that was $34.95 for the Emerald advance and $40 for an insurance - in case there was an error they would pay up to $6,000 to cover it. He then told me they didn't offer any money that day anymore but I would get my refund on the Emerald debit card in 10 days. If I knew they didn't give the money that day I would have done the return myself. Then he realized he forgot to put my wife's income down but it wouldn't change my refund. Why did I get charged $34.95? I didn't get my refund when he said and am still waiting for it. Next I am writing to the BBB of Rhode Island. I wouldn't give them my business and I don't think anyone should.
During my time getting my taxes prepared the tax preparer never one time told me how much any of it was going to cost!! She just kept saying tap that screen and tap to sign... no explanation. So out of $700 refund it cost me $242... What a ripoff!!! People please don't fall into this. Go elsewhere. Search other options but do NOT give h&r block your hard earned money!!
My husband and I went to H&R Block yesterday, 1/27/16, to file our taxes. My husband has been going there for 5 years and has always had a good experience, but it was my first time. I was apprehensive because I'd always filed my taxes online and the process was easy and inexpensive, but we decided to go into H&R together this time since we got married this year and wanted some expert advice about filing jointly/separately and wanted to make sure we did everything correctly. It was the worst customer experience I've ever had. First, our preparer -- ** at H&R Block 22668 in Bloomington, MN -- was late for our appointment. Next, she declined to look over my previous years' tax returns, even though I brought three years worth for her. Then, she couldn't find my husband in her system despite being a previous customer -- this took over 10 minutes for her to look before she gave up, and included her misspelling his name and entering his DOB and social incorrectly over and over again, and convinced me that she didn't know what she was doing. The entire visit took over an hour and a half for a fairly simple return -- a joint return, 3 W2s, one student loan interest form -- and the bulk of that was us watching her misspell things and having to correct her, or waiting as she tried to figure out how to do things. She missed several important pieces as she went through the forms that WE had to ask about or ask her to correct -- addresses, numbers, entire forms, missed check boxes. On top of that, she couldn't answer our questions well and sometimes yelled over to her coworker when she felt stuck. And worse yet, her coworker would come back and tell her what she was doing was wrong or could be considered fraudulent. Meaning, if she hadn't asked him we could get in trouble for her incompetence. Other times she stopped and gave us lengthy explanations for things that didn't even apply to us. And then at the end, she gave copies of our W2s to the receptionist and the receptionist said, "What do I do with these?" WHAT? How are these two employed here and entrusted with peoples' personal information? It was infuriating. I could have done what our preparer did in a third of the time with better accuracy and for a fraction of the price online. We went to H&R specifically to get advice, guidance, support, and experience to feel confident in doing our taxes, and we were willing to pay a bit more for it. But we ended up paying $160 to spend 90 minutes reviewing and correcting someone who seemed as experienced as a child and to make sure she didn't keep making mistakes. I've worked in customer service and this is unbelievable. I feel the need to tell everyone I know how terrible this experience was and how inexperienced H&R Block preparers are. Never again.
I was charged $287.00 for a simple 1040A e-filing. I was totally prepared with my few documents and the whole process took about 40 minutes. When I asked what the cost would be at the outset I was informed that, "It would probably be about the same as last year's 1040-A filing... ($310.00). When the preparer was finished with the filing (Most of my information from last year was still in their computer)... the cost to prepare and e-file was even more than last year, although I was receiving even less of a tax refund ($335.00) but, when I complained that this year's cost was even more than my 1040-A filing last year the preparer dropped the price a bit and said, "Oh, I'm doing this because you're don't have to file a state return and you're a great customer every year." Here's the kicker: I turned on the television after filing my return only to see Block's latest commercial that shows that if you go online Block will file a simple Federal Tax Return (1040EZ or 1040A) free. And it would've only been $9.99 for a State Return if I had needed to file one. So much for customer loyalty and yes, I guess I am a "great customer."
I met with a tax preparer on 1/17 to get a quote on doing my taxes after having uploaded my documents to their online system. I had a couple of hard copies of additional documents and I was told that since I had bought a house it would take a few hours to review everything and he would call me later that day to discuss. I received a phone call later that day from one of his colleagues who informed me that their online system wasn't accessible until February and that I'd have to email my electronic documents unsecurely and I did so. I didn't hear back from him so on Thursday 1/22 I called the office. He stated that his email had been down and I would have to resend the documents, which I did immediately. I called a few hours later to make sure he received the documents but got the main H&R Block customer service line because no one from the office answered the phone. They told me that the preparer would call me back at 3PM. At 3:01PM I received an email from him that they received my documents and would call shortly. I hadn't heard anything by 10 am the next day so I sent an email to follow up. I tried calling the office at 1:58 PM and no one answered, and my call was redirected to the main H&R Block line again. I explained the lack of response from the preparer and stated that I wanted to discontinue with working with him and with H&R Block altogether. I also stated that I wanted a copy of the hard copies of the documents I left scanned and emailed to me, and I was promised that would be done. I then received an emailed link to a survey from H&R Block Customer Service which was copied to 19 of their customers. Privacy Breach!!! I was even more infuriated. I sent an email to the preparer the next day when I hadn't heard from anyone just to state that I'd like my documents ASAP. Today, 9 days after my original appointment and 4 days after having told customer service to discontinue work on my paperwork, at 4 PM I sent an email to follow up and ask for a scanned copy of my documents. 3 hours later the tax preparer emailed me looking for additional documents stating that my taxes had been completed!!! I have no idea how to follow up now because no one from H&R Block Customer service has followed up. If I am charged a single cent I will be irate.
State tax not filed. My case keeps getting closed. H&R Block never has done one thing. I keep waiting -- longer I wait more it cost. Been going on 5 years all lies. Idiots in the office thinks I will go away. You owe me as right now 6 thousand dollars. Next month be 6500 dollars cost me my job over this. Never trust H&R Block you want have anyone help you. They just keep passing it around, longer and longer. Don't use H&R Block. Go to a local accountant -- cheaper and will help if get in trouble. H&R Block should be forced to close up. I used them for 20 years. When new media get this let's see how H&R Block comes out. Thanks for nothing.
I charge 100 flat, no more to do a simple return. I charge typically 300 for a complex return, that's it simple. I have done taxes for over 30 years. I have done large corporations with over 200 million in revenues. I have done simple returns but of all the returns I have had to redo were ones that were done by H&R Block. One of my clients could not believe that I got them over 40,000 in refunds that H&R Block missed, but it turned out that the IRS sent them the money. The fact is H&R Block has in my opinion filed more tax returns in error than they have ever filed a correct one.
I have been using H&R Block since 1998. Their charges are sky high. Next year I'll be looking somewhere else. My forms were 2 1099 charity, medical. I paid 255.00. My refund was 1281. Heads up if you walk into their office expect to pay over 200.00.
DO NOT USE H&R BLOCK! I was charged $400 for just rewriting last year's taxes for me when I was told it would cost fifty dollars, then I got a letter from the IRS that mistakes were made! These are not honest people!!!
They make mistakes on your taxes, take your money, and run. Don't listen to their advertisement.
My fiance and I filed with H&R Block and still have not received our rental property taxes. They kept going back and forth with the state and them "looking into it", until one of the reps told me that it's no longer their problem because it's outside of the time frame. We was suppose to get our rental tax returns back in October. I can say that myself and my fiance will never be using this again because of their poor customer service and because I'm now out almost a grand that no one can explain to me. Also, due to the nature of this, I can assure you that my relatives and friends will not be using them either unless they are willing to at least give me an explanation as to where my money is.
I filed my 2013 taxes with H&R Block and had done so for 4 years prior. That year I had received a lawsuit settlement which I am not a tax pro so of course I went to H&R Block because they are supposed to be professionals. The tax preparer said to file my W2's first and then we will go back and amend my taxes with the settlement, which we did and since it was not my normal return I got the peace of mind protection. Two years later I received a letter from the IRS stating I owe $3100 from unreported income. I immediately took it to H&R Block to see what the issue was and the preparer said my original preparer filed it incorrectly and that she was going to fix it and I had to send a form into the IRS disputing the amount. I asked about the peace of mind protection plan, and the preparer said that she was going to file the claim and it could take 4-6 weeks but that they would take care of it. Since August I have spoken with a manager, a district manager, 3 employees customer service. I sent the head of Public Relations an email after several attempts to get some resolution, and to no avail. I sent the CEO a letter explain the situation and stating I need some help because no one seems to know what is going on or what to do but yet they keep telling me they will take care of it. I been denied 3 times now and given several different claim numbers where I keep taking them paperwork because they cannot find the ones I have given 4 times already. When I first filed I brought my settlement papers, the check stub I kept from the check with the funds I received, and the 1099. I don't know what is so difficult!!! They denied me because they said I didn't provide the 1099 initially when I filed but I did!!! When my original was amended it said I owed $227 because of my settlement but the IRS says I owe $3100 plus interest because it is now Jan 2016. If the original preparer would have filed it correctly she would have gotten $3100 also and I would not be in this situation!!! I just would have gotten minus $3100 on my return!!! I just keep getting a runaround and since I have tried to contact corporate headquarters by email and mail and phone it seems like they do not care one bit about their clients, their reputation or their brand, JUST THEIR POCKETS!!!
I had made an appointment with the H&R Block customer service hotline on December 22, 2015, through an automated service. I was asked all my information and given an appointment the following day (December 23, 2015). I get to the location all the lights are off. I knock on the door and no one answers. I call the number for that location and it gets automatically transferred to the main H &R Block hotline where I had previously made the appointment. Someone answers the phone and is telling me she is sorry no one is there for my appointment. At the same time, a lady inside comes out to get her belongings from the back room. She was sitting at the entire time I was knocking and calling. She tells me, "Sorry, we are closed" from behind the door and walks away. This same woman 5 minutes later comes out and leaves. She keeps telling me "Sorry we are closed. All H&R Block offices are closed for the season." Doesn't want to hear a word I'm telling her and goes about her way leaving me standing there talking to the representative over the phone. The representative heard entire thing and then goes to me "I'm sorry, I have other locations you may go to right now without an appointment."
After moving to Florida last year, I had not found an accountant, so I tried H&R Block. They charged me $483.25 which is more than double of what I paid in New York and the woman who worked with me, Pat **, sold me an additional policy which they call "piece of mind", that insured against their errors. Well, she made a big error that cost me an additional $970.54. The IRS sent me an audit notice on 5/12/15. So I filed a claim with their company. On 5/21/15 I sat down with Bernard ** from their office. He filed the claim for me which was given claim number **. After waiting 4 weeks I called to check the status and was told that there was information missing that needed to be sent to claims. I was told that it was being taken care of. On 7/16 I called to complain and the file was given a new case number to expedite the process, the new number was **. On 9/16 after a few calls I was told that they were still missing info from the local office so I went there and saw the papers faxed to the claims department. Now the case number is **. I called on 9/30 and again on 10/16 and finally on 11/4 I am told that there is a new examiner and that again there are missing documents from the local office. I called Bernard and he said he was faxing them that day. After 8 months of aggravating phone calls and stalled messages, I finally get a notice that my claim is disallowed, because according to the adjuster I waited too long to file a claim after I was notified by the IRS about the error. The truth is that I went to them 2 weeks after I got the notice. They also claim that they were not given the chance to dispute the IRS claim. I went to their office with the notice and was told by Bernard ** that the woman who filed for me made an error and that I should file a claim no mention of disputing the claim. I called them every other week. My claim was handled by so many people and the claim number kept changing. This is bogus! These people misrepresented themselves first as tax professionals which they obviously are not, and by selling me insurance that they had no intentions on making good on.
I had my 2014 taxes prepared by H&R Block. I met with a gentleman by the name of Lee, at the Riverview, Fl. 301 location. This is the River Oaks location. He was a nice guy but was very confused by the new software that H&R Block was utilizing. It was very painful to sit there and watch this man toggle back and forth between screens, trying to figure out how to do this or that. We got through it and my taxes were filed, I was due a refund of around $300. Fast forward 9 months. I received a letter from the IRS, two weeks before Christmas, informing me that I owe them $1700. I called and made an appointment with H&R Block and met with a lady that told me Lee had made an error and she inquired if I had purchased their Peace of Mind Plan? I did not buy their "in case we screw up" plan because I felt that I paid a premium to H&R Block to make sure my taxes are done correctly. Why pay them more money, just in case they screw up? Well in retrospect, I should have. The lady informed that since I did not purchase this protection plan, I am responsible for paying the $1700. I would not recommend H&R Block to anyone.
Do not use H&R Block for your tax needs. They are not competitively priced as compared with private tax preparers. I had a simple tax return with only 1 W-2 and a list of moderate expenses that I provided. The Agent (Richard) had trouble using the online program and had to go back several times to change numbers and put them in the right place. The whole session took about 40 minutes resulting in a 4-page tax return. I had not ask the cost because I had my taxes done there the last two years and thought I knew what the cost would be. The charge for this easy return was $435.00. This is 4 times more expensive than my previous tax attorney. That's over a hundred dollars a page, and two of the pages didn't even have numbers on them. This is a rip off and should not be tolerated. It was so simple to do, I will do my own taxes next year and avoid the outrageous amount they charge for doing a return.
My husband and I filed taxes with H&R Block April 2015. It is now December 1st with no response from them. I've inquired online and the website says there is no record, though we've filed with them the last four years. I contacted IRS and State, neither have received anything. I called H&R Block directly, got an operator that asked for all my personal info via phone and says "it looks like a problem.." no duh? Then I was told I could get an appointment to discuss it in person. When she made the appointment, I asked her to leave notes that this was not a new account and to state the problem "I paid for services, not rendered." She says she didn't, but should have and now she cant... ugh. My appointment is Saturday... I will let you know if I ever go back again after this fiasco. Loved my tax preparer though. The one plus...
We have always got an Emerald card every year till this year you say poor credit. I know you switch bank. We always paid it back on time. You have denied more people which like us you based your finding off of. I do not think we will ever go back to H&R Block due to this because our refund will have to go to your bank than ours and you will probably keep the money. So yes I can say I would give a 0 rating.
I am self-employed & have had tax returns prepared by an independent CPA for 30 years - never a problem. After my CPA moved, he sold his business & somehow it ended up after a couple of years under H&R Block. The first 2 years with them were satisfactory. For the tax year 2014, I filed an extension in April 2015, and sent in an amount with the extension form. I had an appt. in October that lasted from 10 a.m. to 3 o'clock, where appts. had generally been 1-2 hours in the past. I was so exasperated. Several times the tax preparer needed help on the computer from another associate. I heard things like "the more pages your return is, the higher the fee," "H&R Block was bought out & under new ownership," "new software," "I don't set the fee," blah, blah, blah. My accounting is old-fashioned, I admit, and I put everything in writing in a ledger in categories & I go prepared. But this experience was just horrible. Also, I was given the spiel on the POM, which I declined. Everything was documented, so I was not worried. No big deal; he was doing his job. But there was another appt. to finalize things which lasted 2 hours. The fee was $650!!! I had never been charged that much before! I paid the fee on the front end rather than it being deducted out of any refund, and I have to say I was relieved I did not owe additional taxes. The IRS sent me a correction on the refund in a couple of weeks. Instead of over a thousand dollars refund, it was reduced to $277.00 due to tax estimates being included on the form as being paid -- which I never gave the info to the preparer anyway because I didn't pay the tax estimates from 2013. He said the IRS was expecting those payments and that they were still owed. I told him I didn't doubt that, that my previous CPA had always included tax estimates, and sometimes I paid them, sometimes I didn't. But when I questioned how did that figure even populate on the tax return, he said, "Well, you must have told me." I said, "No, I didn't; I told you what I had paid with my Request for Extension, plus what was deducted out of my Social Security Retirement." Anyway, he said, "Well, regardless, you still owed that and that is the difference in the refund amount." THIS WAS NOT MY ERROR. So essentially he blamed the mistake on the new software. I will not return to H&R Block again.
My husband carries tax debt from a business bankruptcy some years ago. For 2013, our first year married, we filed married but separate to guard against his debt taking my refund. For 2014, we met with a "tax professional" at the Murrieta, CA office of H&R Block and were advised that we could file jointly but with an Injured Spouse Allocation. We were told that the the Injured Spouse Allocation would likely delay the refund by a few months, but we were not told that acceptance of the Allocation was up to the IRS - they may or may not decide to accept it. This was not made clear to us, it was not expressed at all, in fact. Had we known that, we would NOT have filed jointly with the Allocation. Today we received the letter from the IRS stating that my refund was allocated to his debt. When I called the H&R Block office, I was essentially told "Yeah, that's a shame. I don't know why She wouldn't have told you that." Thanks for nothing, H&R. Your "tax professional" cost us $3k.
Hi. I'm a bit disappointed with the calculations of my tax return I received last Feb. 2015. It happened that I am owing now the CRA $1600+ because of the wrong computation.
I filed a return back in March 2015 electronically with H&R block agent. She immediately found something she left off and IRS owed me thousands. She filed an amendment. Tragically this agent died soon afterward and I was assigned a new agent. IRS received amendment prior to attending to the original electronic filing. I met with new agent in May 2015 to find out the status at the office which is only open by appointment now (during tax season it is always open). She contacted IRS for me via POA and had to do an extension on the first return. It is now November. Been trying for 3 wks to contact new agent. Offices closed. No number for agent. H&R Block just told me they have no number to contact the agent themselves nor do they have employee email to contact the agent or even a personal email address for their own employees! Never heard of a business that closes it's doors, has no email for employees, and can't get in touch with their own employees! Terrible service. Even spoke with a "floor manager" who gave me the same song and dance. I highly recommend going to a business other than H&R BLOCK for something as important as your taxes where can contact their own agents and employees. IRS just gives a recording saying taxes being worked on. IRS website says the same thing. 8 months and no money. No status update. No way to contact this stupid agent.
10/13/2015 H&R Block office at AIRLINE PARK in METAIRIE prepared our taxes for the past 10 years and what thanks do we get. They screwed up our returns. Here is what happened, we file every year around the same time with the same tax preparer. We were not prepared for what was going to happen this year to us. We have yet to receive our federal income taxes back, no communication whatsoever, still don't know what happened to those. Meanwhile we got our state income taxes back, cashed and spent the check. Then H&R block started to hassle us about a payment cause our taxes have not come back yet. Recently today 10/13/2015 we receive a bill from the state wanting 317.00 back from us cause the person at the state said one amount was given to the IRS and different amount to them. Our tax person screwed us royally this year. BOTTOM LINE IS WE WILL NEVER TRUST OR USE THE H&R BLOCK AGAIN EVER.
My husband worked out of state for 4 years, was home only 50 days in the year. H&R Block rep called the state tax office, that person agreed that my husband did not have to file state tax. He had a home & mailing address in the state he worked. My husband received a letter from the state tax office asking why he had not filed state taxes since 2011? I called & told them H&R Block had told us he did not have to file & why. Tax office said, "no that's not true, H&R Block should know better." Now we get a letter stating my husband owes over $20,000 in back taxes! I did purchase the Peace of Mind each year with H&R Block. We have now retained a lawyer.
I have actually filed my taxes with H&R Block for the past four years. This year, I moved to Kansas and had to file my tax returns in Olathe KS where I reside. I originally filed my returns at the Santa Fe location not realizing there was a location closer to me. The woman filing my return didn't know what she was doing and kept looking in her manual for every little thing. After an hour, I had to be somewhere and left her to do the rest of my returns. We agreed I would come back to sign and pay for the work she would do. I called her every other day to ask if it was completed and she told me she was still working on it. After a week and a half, I finally spoke to a manager about it and told him that I really need to complete it and have it done. I ended up taking my tax returns to the closer location off 119th and filing them there. A month later, I received more tax returns on some loans that I had and went back to do an adjustment during my lunch break. BIG MISTAKE! The woman helping me had meningitis, so she told me, and was coughing and sneezing everywhere. (I did catch something from her.) She also didn't finish before I left. I told the receptionist I had to go back to work and she told me that everything would be taken care of and that they will mail out the adjustment as soon as it was finished. It never was. After a couple months of waiting and realizing I had never received the money, I went back to H&R Block. They were unable to find the original forms and needed to make new ones. I stayed until the adjustments were completed. Turns out, H&R Block can't send adjustments, the tax payer needs to send adjustments themselves. So I brought the new forms to the Post Office and sent out the letters (with my own stamps) that the H&R Block agent told me to send out with the addresses he gave me. One of these letters and forms was to Kansas. A month later, I received a letter from the Kansas Department of Revenue saying I owed them money. Seeing that my tax returns were from the previous year and I had never earned money in Kansas, the idea was crazy. I realized that the person helping me with the adjustments had told me to send some forms to Kansas when I never should have. I immediately called H&R Block to set up an appointment. Their hours are from 12pm- 6pm on Tuesday and were somehow booked all day. They are closed on Wednesday, so I made an appointment for Thursday to have this all fixed. Bottom line is that I have always trusted H&R Block with filing my taxes. Their charges are a little high but I always thought it was because they always do things correctly and know what they are doing which in the states I lived in before (New York and Arizona) they did know what they were doing. Based on my experience this year, I will never do my taxes with H&R Block again!
I had my 2013 taxes prepared by H&R and received 2 letters from IRS for 2 different mistakes and paid late fees and interest for both notices. The first notice was for not reporting business tax, the second they failed to report 1099 earnings.
I did my taxes online in 2014, everything went fine. Until this year, 2015 I am going to purchase a home so I need a copy of my 2014 tax returns. When I online to print them I couldn't remember my password and the security questions they asked was my oldest sibling's birthday. I tried to explain to them when I set up my account it did not prompt me to answer that question. I never entered that security question. So after hours at their office and hours on the phone and lie after lie, I was told that there was nothing they could do. I can never retrieve my 2014 returns from H&R Block. I was told sorry they could not help me for security purpose. That I needed to contact the IRS. So now I have to put off the purchase of my home to wait on the IRS when I paid H&R Block. I will never use this so called company again. We all forget passwords and usernames. All of that is good but get real.
Feb 19th 2015 we received a certified letter from the IRS stating we owed an amount for unpaid taxes for the year of 2013. Feb 20th we took the letter to the H&R block office (Kennewick Wa) where we filed our taxes for the last several years. The representative in the office (Virginia **) was not the same person that filed our taxes but advised us not to respond to the IRS. We were also told we would be contacted by the person handling our case. Weeks went by and no contact was made. I repeatedly called the office and was given the runaround. Come to find out the office closed. In May I was contacted by another H&R block in the area who informed me they had my file but they had no idea why because the file was not complete. So we had to start over. I went to the new office and started my POM claim with Maria **. I was called multiple times during the next few weeks to bring in additional paperwork, even at the 6 week time period they were asking for additional paperwork. (We were denied due to missing paperwork) The staff openly admitted the wrongdoing on the part of H&R block and states everything should be fixed and a check would be sent once it was complete. We were helped by three different representatives because the staff members were going on 'vacation' so we signed paperwork so 'christal' could speak to the IRS on our behalf and this never happened because 'christal' went on vacation also. I received another letter from the IRS that we owed a new amount with interest which we then had to start the POM claim over again. H&R Block then denied our claim stating we needed a letter that we never received. Our local IRS office gave us the letter that H&R block was requesting which was dated back to January, this paper was given to H&R Block and we were denied because it was over the 60 day time period. The only way we knew we were denied was we called the H&R service line to find out the status of our claim. They said it was denied Aug 20th and we would receive a letter in 7-10 business days which we never received. I contacted the local office and told them I was going to get a lawyer because I have cooperated and given them everything they asked for, they then refused to speak to me. I was contacted the next day by a manager (Scott **) who told me that a lawyer isn't necessary and that he is personally working my claim and someone would contact me in the next few days to help me with my case and help me with my legal options. I never received this phone call. I could not get Scott on the phone anymore so I began emailing him. In an email he then told me he could not speak to me and my lawyer would need to contact the legal department. I Informed him I did not have a lawyer and he still refused to help me. Sept 14th 2015 I was contacted by Tiffini with H&R Block client services who told us we failed to contact them within 60 days so our claim was denied. The letter from Jan 5th that we never received was the reason we were denied yet we turned in the letter we received from Feb 19th which was within the 60 days. Even though it is within 60 days they are telling us we need to produce 'evidence' that it really is within 60 days. Can someone help us because we do not know where to go from here. The IRS has given us time to get this settled but we are not getting anything accomplished all the while we are accumulating interest which H&R Block is saying they are not responsible for.
H&R Block made an error on our tax return. In June we went to the office and were informed they would only pay for the fine but not the entire amount because we had not taken their insurance, which we were not informed about at the work was done. In August we called told it was pending. We called again in September and spoke to 3 different representatives and was told the same thing. They then informed us we would have to go back to the local office.
I had to do my state taxes and decided to make an online appointment with H&R Block for a Saturday in September at the location nearest to my home. Since it wasn't tax season I could not just walk into a location. Once I made the appointment online I received a confirmation email and a reminder through my cell for the date and time, so this ensured me that my appointment was confirmed. Just before my appointment at 9 AM I arrived to the location and found the office to be closed. I waited until 9 AM for someone to maybe turn a light on or to maybe show up a little late to the location, but they never did. Outside of the office I called the H&R Block Customer Service line when she explained that the system never assigned my appointment to the tax office representative. She attempted to make an appointment for me at a further out of the way location which I couldn't do so I had her make the appointment for a more convenient time at the same location. That Monday came and I show up about ten minutes before my 5 PM appointment and again found the office to be closed. So again, I call customer service to try and find out where the personnel at that location were. I got no answers, but a repeated "all I can do is..." I tried a number of times to speak to a supervisor or to get a reason for this repeated lack of service. The customer service rep explained that she did not know why there wasn't anyone at the location after making appointments for a second time. She also explained that there was a location about 14 miles away that does take walk-ins that could help me, but in 5 PM traffic in Houston, Texas taking a 14-mile drive to one of the busiest parts of Houston would not be possible unless I was insured I would be able to see someone or to even ensure that someone was at the location. Well, she couldn't ensure nor would she contact the location to make sure anyone was at the location. All I got was empty attempts at customer service, repeated words of "all I can do for you is..." Make another appointment and my taxes that still weren't done!!! OH... By the way, in all of that two internal trouble tickets regarding the matter were supposedly open and I can tell you I haven't heard back from anyone with H&R BLOCK regarding the matter.
Mistake made on my 2014 state tax. I used H&R Block for the first time on February 4, 2015. I was ensured by tax preparer # ** at Kailua office in Hawaii that my state refund would be $841.00 dollars. I found out that only $61.00 was deposited in my account. After calling H&R Block main office in Honolulu they informed me the tax preparer made a major error. Not only have I called numerous times and have gotten no call back when they said they would call back. I feel H&R Block admitted a mistake was made but did not seem to care. I guess your policy is "if we make an error on your tax returns, OH WELL TOO BAD!!!" Horrible customer service!!!
H&R Block and its POM insurance is an outright scam. After one year of going back and forth with our H&R Block appointed Advisor, who conveniently retired before our claim was processed, we received a rejection notice saying that the POM claim would not be accepted because it was not filed on time. The H&R Block Premium Manager literally emailed us saying "The POM claim can be filed as soon as the court issues its judgment. We'll then need to prepare the corresponding state adjustment. POM will pay for both IRS and state taxes up to the combined total due or $5,500, whichever is smaller, plus prorated penalties and interest". The claim was filed right after the judgement was issued in May 2015 and we had been waiting 2 months for the claim to go through, only to get a rejection notice instead of a check??? Any advice on lawyers that have experience with POM scams and H&R Block?
This dispute has been resolved for an undisclosed amount.
I had taxes prepared by H&R block in Kent Washington for 2014. The fees charged by H&R Block were double the fees charged in previous years by other tax preparation company for the same forms. Tax staff is unavailable. I placed many phone calls to the office and was transferred to an automated system. The automated system then transfers to an answering service which takes a message. None of the messages were responded to by an H&R block employee. I have gotten direct deposit for years and arranged for the same with H&R Block. I got an email stating the return was on its way! Several weeks passed and I made several more phone calls to track down my money. After being transferred multiple times, I was told the deposit didn't go through. This was a surprise, H&R Block did not notified me about this. I was then told, a check had been mailed. I still don't have a refund check and have no idea where the mystery check is. It would have been faster to get my return had I mailed in the taxes myself to the IRS. H&R Block didn't get me a better tax return, they just charged double and have extremely poor customer service. I do not recommend H & R Block and will NEVER have them prepare my taxes again.
My Mother sold her home in 2013. When it came time to prepare her taxes, she went to H&R Block. She told them she sold her home in 2013, brought a copy of the HUD-1 Settlement Statement, etc. The tax preparer said she took care of everything. Two years later, my Mother got a letter from the IRS. She went back to H&R Block and they were supposed to file a Schedule D, I believe, but instead filed an Amended Return, charged her close to $300 and said "Sorry for their mistake." A month or so went by and my Mother got another letter from the IRS stating she owed taxes on the sale of her home (she did not, she is single and did not net over $250,000). I took her to a local accountant (not affiliated with H&R Block). The new accountant had her sign a Power of Attorney so she could communicate directly with the IRS and took care of the issue in one day. H&R Block is incompetent and unprofessional and they over-charge. Go elsewhere!
It's rare for a company to "promise" to meet a service standard. So when one does, it catches your eye and distinguishes the company from all of the rest vying for your business. So naturally I was drawn to the H&R Block Expat Services' website two months ago when I read, "We promise to be in contact with you within 48 hours, but hopefully sooner." I subsequently submitted the necessary information and contact details and promptly received an automated confirmation that my request had been received. The confirmation email also reiterated the company's "promise" to contact me within 48 hours or sooner. They never did contact me. Flash forward to three days ago, when I thought I'd give the company another shot, given the company's advertising. I submitted the same information as last time and received another confirmation email reiterating their "promise". It should come as no surprise to anyone who has seen the other customer ratings on this site that H&R Block never followed through on that 2nd promise. The complexity of expat tax filing requires accountants who are mindful of the details and have a strong service orientation to help their customers make the most tax efficient choices. Empty promises and shoddy follow through at point of sale are a sure sign that all may not be right at H&R Block. I will be taking my business elsewhere.
I purchased H&R Block's Peace of Mind insurance when they prepared my 2014 taxes. They made a mistake that cost me nearly $2000 more in taxes, which I have paid to the IRS, at H&R's direction. They have sent me several emails letting me know my claim has been filed, but in spite of an appointment with the TX office that originally prepared my 2014 taxes and two appointments with two different regional offices, I have yet, as of Aug 8, 2014, to get a letter advising my claim is either approved or denied, let alone my rightful reimbursement check. All I have gotten is apologies and promises they will "fix it". The first appointment was cancelled the day before by H&R, because the office that prepared my 2014 tax is not open at all during the summer. The main office in KS was not connected to the TX office evidently, as they made the appointment for me. HELP!!! Updated on 08/15/2015: After I posted my complaint that H&R Block was stalling my claim that their error made me owe more taxes than they figured, making my appointments at offices not open during the summer, cancelling appointments, shifting my appointments with a supervisor to a lower tax preparer, re-submitting my claim and starting over from scratch, etc etc, I got fed up and posted my complaint here. I immediately received an email that my claim had been approved, and received my claim check from them today. Am I satisfied? No. I would be if they had honored their Peace of Mind upfront, instead of stalling, hoping I would give up. Google and read what they did on purpose to our troops overseas that they sold the Peace of Mind insurance to. SHAME SHAME SHAME!
I was about to move to China and needed a tax preparer that could take care of both my American and Canadian taxes. After searching around I met a tax preparer Kathleen ** who assured me that she could take care of all my needs and that I could feel safe to leave her with my taxes while living across the world in China. I gave her all my information and all was going good up until a certain point when she just stop communicating with me. After a month of trying I decided I had to escalate to management to get something done. I talked to an "escalation team" member who apologized for the poor service and assured me that they would take care of this immediately and get someone to respond to me. After a few more weeks I contacted them back and they told me that they were still working on the issue and would get back to me shortly. I have now been trying to get a hold of them for 4 months and cannot get anyone to respond to me or even let me know what is happening with my taxes. It's August and I have no idea what to do. The fact that H&R Block is still in business is amazing to me. I'm now stuck in China with no way of processing my American or Canadian taxes and I'm probably going to get penalized for their sloppy work. What do I do?
Just have to put this out here... I went to H & R Block for the first and last time this year. I filed my taxes the very first day you were able to with H&R Block.. and have had nothing but problems since with them. First as I'm in there, the girl I was working with didn't know what she was doing. A couple times I had to correct her. Second, because I had gotten married in middle of the year, my taxes were withheld till they could figure it out at IRS. For 6 months I tried to get someone to help me, to figure out what was going on. I would get half stories from H & R Block, or they would have me meet at an office and then the others in the office didn't know what was going on. FINALLY they ALL washed their hands off it. Finally after complaining to mgmt. Someone decides to finally help me. It took 3 hours of being on hold with IRS and 6 months. While in the office with an office mgr. named Nancy, they got it squared away.. another 6 weeks and I would get my refund. All the while, I'm being told, if I knew names people would be fired at the H & R Block for what they did, and that I was going to be getting a refund for what I paid because of the service I got. I wasn't looking for a full refund but $300 dollars for ** service is ridiculous!!!! Especially the numerous times I was told to go to the office (missing work in the process) and NO ONE was there or they didn't know what to do. So I was told by Nancy at this three hour meeting that they were giving me a refund and that she and her boss had already discussed it and to call back when she got back from vacation in July. So I call, and get the runaround about she's got a client in her office, etc... Nancy never calls me back. I FINALLY get a hold of her today and she says I AM NOT getting a refund.. I quote what she tells me in her office about me getting a refund and her exact words are "I'm not disputing what was said but you got a refund of your taxes so we are not giving you a refund for our services." She also tells me not to call her office again. FINE... I will blow up every social media and I will go above your head. If you don't want to be ripped off.. DO NOT go here.
I had my taxes done at H&R Block for years and years at the local Store here in Black River Falls, WI, but I had been separated for 2 years and waiting for my divorce to get finalized. Me and my (ex) husband decided to file married for the last time upon which the lady whom represented us and helped us with the taxes went through all the paperwork so fast that I had to keep asking what she was doing and reminding her of the fact me and the (ex) husband lived at separate dwellings. I had to change from Indian Trust Land which is State Tax exempt to State land which is not tax free. The case being I was told I didn't owe any monies but then I get a letter in the mail from the IRS that I owe an additional amount above and beyond the amount IRS kept. Upon telling H&R Block this fact I was told the Peace of Mind Guarantee was dependent upon the manager of the local H&R Block office...
Hello, I filed my taxes online in March. I contacted H&R Block on several occasions for the status of my return. For several months they told me to contact the IRS regarding my return. The IRS told me consistently that H&R Block had my refund check. Finally IRS did a sweep to locate my refund. The sweep took about 8 weeks. I received a letter from the IRS with a ref # advising me to contact H&R Block for my refund check. I contacted H&R Block and advised them of the letter I received from the IRS. The service agent told me I should receive my check from H&R Block in about 10 days. This was 3 weeks ago, and I still have not received my check. I am so frustrated for being misinformed for several months from H&R Block and they had my refund check the entire time "since March". They have horrible customer service, no documentation was posted on my account in regards to all the calls, and misinformed information that was communicated to me. Never will I use them again!
I opted to have my tax refund sent to my fiance's bank account where I had been cashing my pay roll checks, no problem. When me and fiance checked the bank acct we found out because my name wasn't on it they sent my refund back. I automatically went straight to H&R Block on two different occasions and was told I have to go the IRS. I went there and was told H&R Block Bank had it to go to them. I called the bank and was told to fill out a RAC form in which I did and when I called the bank back was told their tax agent never notarized it so I went back and filled out another one. I have called everyday for over 2 months and they tell me wait 3-5 days or that it has not been processed. I called yesterday and told they should have it done by the end of the business day because of all the hassle I've been through. I call today and now they're trying to tell me I filled out the wrong form and find every reason not to issue me money. I have filled out every form they asked, even got the emerald card like I was told, took time off of work numerous times to get this done and they still won't issue me my money. I keep getting the runaround. I have been going to them for 4 years but after this problem and them showing that their employees have no idea what they're doing and can't get on same page I will never go back. I can't trust them with MY money. I now have to hire an attorney and will broadcast to everyone how shady, rude and unorganized they are.
I was having my taxes prepared and during the session I was asked how I was filing, I said Head of Household. I said my daughter lives with me full time but my ex husband gets to claim her as a deduction for two years. My tax expert told me I couldn't. He said "Everything goes with the child." I told him my lawyer said I could still claim her for the EIC credit to which he repeated "it all goes with the child." So I listened to the expert and filed single. A few weeks later I received a letter from the IRS saying I qualified for the EIC credit up to 496.00. I took the letter back to my H&R Block office. I met with a different tax expert, he read it and said "O I hate when the IRS sends these letters, you won't qualify for that amount. It says UP to 496.00. It might only be 46 dollars." I said I would still like my 46 dollars. He looked at my tax forms, did some calculations and said "Looks like WE can get you another 146 dollars. We will fill out the amended returns and call you when they are ready." I then said I looked at my return myself and (flipped to the EIC form) and said "It doesn't say on this form my daughter has to be a claimed dependent just that she lives a majority of the time with me." I have physical custody and she lives with me over 320 days of the year. The tax expert looked at it, read and reread it. He then pulled out the Tax Laws, I told him how my lawyer said I would qualify for EIC credit during divorce negotiations. He finally found where it said I could qualify as head of Household. He said he didn't know it either. He said he would recalculate my return and call me when it was ready. The next day they had it ready. I met with a third tax expert at the office to go over my amended return. I qualified for over 3600.00 additional federal return (I had already received 540 filing single), 77.00 from state (also additional to 430 filing single), and 46.00 from the state I had just moved to (did not qualify filing single). The third expert went on to tell me that "It was a good thing ** checked my return," and explained each refund and told me where to sign. I had to mail out my amended return myself to federal and two different states - another 13.00 dollars on top of my 246.00 I was charged for my original tax prep. I waited and checked on line. My amended return was received on May 4th. I waited as told. On June 20 I received my amended return back from IRS again saying there was incomplete information. No qualified child was listed. I was so mad I didn't want to deal with H&R again - filled out information needed and paid another 8.00 to mail back. It is now June 28 and still no status of my refund that H&R Block messed up 3 times. I feel I would get my tax prep amount refunded (the maximum refund guaranty was found IRS and my persistence) and onstage to mail in H&R Block mistakes.
I had done my taxes on April 15, 2015. During that time I had paid once. The irs requested more information regarding to this new law with medical. My tax prepared was under the impression she was doing my taxes correctly. But when the irs ask me for some additional information, I went back to hr block once again. The reason why I went back to them because they done my taxes in the first place. In the process of hr block helping me amend my taxes that was prepared by them in the first place, they double the amount I paid them. It was very close to $400 dollars. I will not commend them. I don't feel I should have pay for something they should had taken care of the first time. When hr block should known all the questions to ask and the new laws when preparing their clients taxes. I believed I was cheated.
I filed my taxes on my own this past year, hadn't even graduated high school yet. I was talked into getting the emerald card because it was supposed to be faster - the amount of time it took to be deposited was fine but a few months go by and nearly 850+$ is out of my tax return and guess what? There is absolutely no way to get a printed/downloadable copy of my transactions. You have to call to get a list told to you, so even if I did think fraud had happened it's not like I could cross reference because I would have to call them back 10 times to just figure out one charge.
H&R Block have been advertising for free filing of Returns BUT when I log in they divert me to the column where I am supposed to pay. WHY SO ??? I clicked under DIY self filing. This is the third time I am filing return through this Company. I want to know as to how do I go for Free filing.
I went in to do my taxes in march and went in 7 times to sign papers and do know about my taxes. Called to find out they never did my taxes. Now it's July still nothing called and went in yet again to find out they still didn't do my taxes. Called again and still nothing. Ughh so annoying that they have all this info about me and yet know nothing. I spoke to 5 people and still haven't heard back. It's going on months so now I give up. Now waiting for it to get a hold of me. Nothing more I can do.
I came to US only in August 2014 and my case is a perfect example of the level of knowledge H&R has in Tax return preparation. I filed my Tax Return with the help of H&R in Salt Lake City UTAH. They made a mess of it. At first they filed my tax return along with the ITIN application, you won't believe without my Spouse's name in the Tax return. Then when the ITIN application was rejected, they created a new Tax return with my spouse's name in it, but they didn't file it as an amendment. They just created it as a new return and IRS treated it as duplicate. Now IRS asked me to wait for four months to get my Refund since the duplicates will be worked on manually. Irony is that person who did my tax return boasted of years of experience. If that wasn't enough they didn't tell me that I have to send in a separate TAX return copy to State tax department as well, which I later found myself that there is such a process. Altogether a nightmare experience with them.
Our second year having our taxes done at H&R Block and with the same preparer. Our tax information stayed the same for both years. We were overcharged by more than 100.00 from the year before - over 500 to have our taxes done when it was 400 the previous year. When we asked for an explanation of the charges, the preparer had no idea why and didn't bother to look. After I filed a complaint w/ her manager, she emailed me she'd be happy to sit down and discuss the fees. However, I had done my own research - like calling another H&R Block office. I was told our preparer was moved to a 'Premium' office so the fees were higher. We were unaware there even was such a thing. Calls and emails to customer service and the Regional Manager were grossly mishandled. The Regional Manager misunderstood our case in every one of the 2 or 3 times he contacted us. We expected he'd try to protect the money they took from us, but his defense of the rep was quite concerning from a consumer standpoint. We weren't granted the courtesy of a phone call from the Regional Rep after he spoke w/ the Preparer. He sent an email and dismissed our complaints as if we were difficult in our solution. We asked to be refunded the difference from the previous year as we were not told of the upcharge prior to having our return completed. The Regional Manager refused our sole (and quite reasonable) request. We will not be using or recommending H&R Block again. 530.00 is a ton of money to pay to have taxes prepared and we're not a big, complicated return. There needs to be some kind of reform in this business to protect the consumer. Fees need to be disclosed up front. An across the board policy needs to be in place. The consumer is in serious trouble w/ this industry.
It all began on the 15th - yes I waited until the last day. I made an appointment online for 7:30am only to find out when I arrived at the location that it didn't open until 9am. I called Customer Service, who was friendly but completely unhelpful. I finally got in at 8:30am but due to issues with the computer system didn't get everything completed until 10am. At that point I told the Manager that I deserved a discount off my return. He told me I should have come earlier in the year when they had more money to give out for these types of issues. He finally gave me $40 off for a total charge of $188 and change. I leave, frustrated but at least it's done. Only my return never arrived. I checked the IRS website - nothing. I check H&R Block website - nothing. So I call them and customer service tells me my return was never filed because of an issue processing the payment. I could not believe what I was hearing. If I had not followed up, no one from the company would have gotten in touch with me. I made an appointment to go to a different office (since the office I originally went to closed after tax day) and explained my situation. The woman told me that I should not have waited until the last day and it was my responsibility to make sure I paid the fee. I told her I thought I had paid it, and she acquiesced that the front desk should have checked that the payment went through that day. She did not offer any additional discount off the original price and even tried to charge me more as the price for the return had increased. She also told me that any fees from the IRS for the late filing would be my responsibility. I am so disappointed in my experience. At no point was I treated like a paying customer and what little discount I initially received I had to fight for. I cannot believe this.
In February my taxes were filed. Errors created by H&R Block preparers were found in 4 years of returns - two of those years had Peace of Mind coverage. I am told that instead of calculating one aspect of my return each year, they just carried over numbers that were calculated by the previous preparer. Weak. A claim was generated. This claim was not recognized for a number of weeks and after several calls they recognized that a claim was generated. It is now June. I paid the taxes prior to April... A substantial sum. I call every couple of weeks and am told that my status has been upgraded. I receive a return call of another person a few days later each time. The person is always powerless to help me, though polite. The supposed corporate review of my claim goes on while my budget is off so far for the year. Peace of mind is so far neither reassuring or of any value. After 20 years of expensive tax return preparation, I think I am fed up.
We had to file Amended 1040X form. Wanted it done properly so we went to H&R Block. We saw ** at 174 Mariner Blvd. Spring Hill, FL 34609. ** (# on card) on 5-5-15. We paid $122.25 to have this one form done. On 6-8-15 I received the form back from IRS stating more information was needed. ** said he "forgot" to file the needed "Schedule D form". No apology. Nothing. I expected a "sorry for the inconvenience, and the 5 week delay....we are expecting a $450 refund." We expected it to be done right. Will wait another 5 weeks to find out if it is done correctly. If so, will get refund around October. What did we pay the $120 for?
I filed a report about a rude receptionist and that got me nowhere. H&R Block wasted more time with passing the buck for weeks and weeks. I didn't want to see this so called customer service rep get fired, but hey, if I were to treat somebody like that while I was on the job, I would get a serious write up! Now my issues are with my actual tax lady! (I still owe more for local taxes.) It's not a huge amount, but I'm on a budget so actually it hurts me. I called my tax preparer, she texted me back and asked if we could text tomorrow. I reply yes, and the next day, yep, I am told to contact the same rude receptionist. I text my tax lady back and say no - that I will not talk to the receptionist at all and told her why. Then I receive two messages and I didn't bother to even listen to them. I am finished. I can get them done elsewhere and have started to already ask people. Goodbye H&R.
I would NOT recommend nor EVER go back to H&R Block. They don't tell you what the fee is going to be until the end and I believe they based their fee off of what my refund was. They charged $167.50 for something I would have been charged AT MOST $50 at a local tax place in my hometown. This was for both state and federal taxes but should have been an easy return and if I would have known what I know now I would have prepared my own taxes for FREE!
I went to an H&R Block office to file my taxes in March 2015. The preparer was taking personal phone calls during our appointment and ended up making a mistake on my taxes. He did not include a payment that I had made to the IRS a few months prior (which I provided a copy of). I paid him $224 for the preparation and he said I owed the IRS $204, so I mailed the IRS a check. Soon after I receive a letter from the IRS that I was actually due a refund and that they would send me a check subsequently. I called H&R Block's 1-800 number to let them know that I would like to find out how I can have my preparation fees refunded, as they did not ensure I receive my refund as stated in their Maximum Refund Guarantee, which states as follows from their website: "If you discover an H&R Block error on your return that entitles you to a larger refund (or smaller tax liability), we'll refund the tax prep fee for that return and file an amended return at no additional charge. Refund claims must be made during the calendar year in which the return was prepared." They told me to go to a different location to file a claim. I went to a different location and they made copies of everything. They agreed that I was right and should receive my preparation fees back. However, they said I would have to make another appointment once I receive the refund from the IRS. Once I received my refund from the IRS, I came back in. They made copies of all of my paperwork again and submitted my claim two days later, on April 20th. They told me that I would receive a check in the mail within 2 weeks. This did not happen. I called to follow up and they had no information, not even a claim number, so I called the 1-800 number. They told me that the case had been closed because I didn't purchase the Peace of Mind Guarantee -- a product that was not offered to me, that I had not heard of until then. This guarantee has nothing to do with the Max. Refund Guarantee and applies to audits. I was not audited and this POM guarantee is irrelevant. When I explained this the agent escalated my claim to a case and said I would receive a response in 10 days. In the meantime, I called the retail location back, and they still had no info for me and were unaware of any status updates. They said they would call me back and never did. After 10 days I spoke to the escalations manager who told me that the case was closed and I would not receive my preparation refund. She: "You're putting the maximum refund guarantee in your own words," which was not true, as I was reading it off of their website and referred to paragraph 84, which I cited above. They refuse to stand by their guarantee. This is false advertising. Their website, commercials, and marketing materials all refer to the fact that they stand by the 100% accuracy of their work, or your money back.
We have done our taxes with H&R Block for the past 6 years. In 2010, we were audited and found out it was due to the fact that our tax preparer only submitted my husband's W2. When we complained to them, they blamed it on the IRS and refused to take any responsibility. So what could we do? We were stuck with paying it. This year we decided to give them another chance - and had the worst experience I could have ever imagined...it is never ending. We live in a very small town and they are the only tax preparation service available. Also with everything involved with our tax preparation, it is much easier to take it in vs. E-file. So this year we complete our taxes and after 30 days of not seeing our refund, I start calling in to the IRS. They inform me that it is still being processed so I continue to wait. The next week, I call and the next lady says..."I don't even see that your taxes have been filed." So I call the supervisor of that office to explain and right off the bat she gets very defensive and is quite rude then says, "Listen Mrs. ***, I don't even have your file in front of me and only come to your small town once a week so come in next Wednesday and be there by 9 am." When I show up, I was very calm and said that I wasn't blaming them and that just wanted to double check and get a confirmation number that she should have access to. Her reply..."Well...this is just ** and I don't appreciate being blamed...especially having one of my best tax guys blamed." I was devastated at the language and if I didn't need this handled so bad..would have walked out! So she proceeded to call in to the IRS..got the confirmation number- then of course chewed out the lady on the phone using the same language she used with me! She was more worried that the IRS was blaming H&R Block and making them look bad...than the fact that I was having trouble getting my refund back! So once she got her apology for herself from the lady - she was satisfied and said.."There is your confirmation number...I told you it wasn't our fault!" Wow! I never said it was..how extremely rude..terrible customer service. ...but it didn't end there!!! Another 2 weeks go by..no refund..I keep calling..and after continued research mostly to this site and upon reading other people's issues with H&R Block and how they handled them...I contacted an advocate who also put me in touch directly with the refund dept and it was determined that there was an error on my taxes. The 1095 A was never received for the Marketplace Health Ins.. I told them that when we did our taxes and the preparer said... "Did you pay for insurance this year?" I told him, "Yes" but that I had forgot the form and asked if I should run home and get it? He said.."No, I have everything here..it's fine." Now I don't know everything about taxes..I guess I assumed he had access to something..to print it off-the-wall is why I didn't need to run home! So then I talk to the advocate only to find out I will be waiting another 6 weeks! Now I am FURIOUS! And want my filing fees back... So once again I call the supervisor at H&R Block...as hard as it was, I calmly explain the situation...knowing I would get nowhere if I didn't ..but just like before she was defensive and rude and said..."Look..the IRS lied to you once..I am sure they are lying to you again..." WHAT? I told her.."I have the letter..I don't have the refund..your tax preparer didn't do his job..and I want my filing fees back." I also informed her that we now had an advocate who has been extremely helpful in helping us understand what is going on and is even going to issue us an emergency refund check. I then got the same reply..."I have to look at your file and verify everything you are telling me is true...because we have never had a problem with him and his preparation of taxes." Are you kidding!!! Let's look at my history... Well my appt is today- so we will see if she how this all turns out. No matter how it does...WE WILL NEVER GO BACK!!!! No one person should have to endure a customer service experience such as that!
Worst experience ever. Did my taxes on May 05 2015. Was told I would have my refund within 2 weeks. Still waiting. Management was not helpful. Called the revenue agency and found out it was already issued. I never received my refund from them. They screwed up when filing my return. And cannot account to where it is. I used their "e-file." Never again will I use them to do my taxes.
I have only been returning year after year because of the Tax preparer. She lives in my town and is a very nice lady and have followed her from office to office relocation.. This review is not about her. Every year the price to have my taxes prepared has been climbing which I expect to a certain extent. The last couple of years it has been rising a lot and now hit 440.00 and I do not have a complicated return and could probably do it myself (if I took the time) but I have been loyal and they reach out to me after the year turns to remind me to come in. There is no way to determine what they charge. If you want to try to figure out what they charge they push you to the annual report which is ridiculous and it does not break it down. It should be by tax form used and time. I have no idea how they determine how they came to the 440.00. I will say its pretty easy to get them done with them but I don't trust this company any longer and I would advise against using them. On a side note after I started asking questions and let them know I was not happy I was able to get a 40.00 customer loyalty credit to bring it down 400.00 which is still not worth It.
I went to the H&R Block satellite tax site on MCB Quantico this year to do my taxes with H&R Block for the 1st time thinking I would save myself the stress of filing myself. I couldn't have been more wrong. The first hiccup came when I realized that after a week, the IRS had not received my return. I called the site I went to and was told my return was submitted 7 days earlier and there was a problem with the system but they would call me back within 15 minutes. After 45 minutes I called them and was told that my return had indeed been submitted when I was in earlier and should be received within 21 days. The next day the IRS received my return and began processing it. I filed a complaint and after H&R Block did an investigation, I was contacted and told I was lied to by the office and they didn't submit it till I called a week later. I was given a $100 coupon for next year's taxes and apologized to. If that was the end I would have understood. 6 weeks I received a letter from the Virginia state tax commission notifying me that instead of receiving the $800 for my wife's return the agent quoted us, we owed the state $600! Long story short, after weeks of complaints and finally a visit unannounced to see the agent, I learned she incorrectly filed my wife's return. I had to have my wife amend her return and resubmit it to the state. It has been over 3 months since we did our taxes with H&R Block and we are still waiting on my wife's state return. We have had financial struggles and hardships related to the delay of this return. Through all of this H&R Block has not refunded and of the nearly $400 fee we paid. I have recieved 1 call back about my formal complaint and was told the terrible error would be dealt with. That was over 30 days ago and I have not heard back from the company since. DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH H&R BLOCK!
I filed the 2013 tax return at an office. They charged me over 250$ to file.. The guy was not willing to include the previous year carry over despite it was clear in the papers I showed him!! I had to show him as if he is a naive tax accountant!! The charges raised to over 300$. When I filed the 2014 tax return using a software, I found out that the stupid guy entered my net dividends ie I paid foreign taxes for these dividends and the stupid guy entered the net dividends instead of the gross and crediting me the taxes I paid. This resulted in a loss of refund of over $300. I complained and asked for a refund of my fees for the wrong filing - as is clear in their website.. any error or higher returns I find entitle me to get compensation up to 10,000$ - this is just a lie.. I complained about a month ago and was told to expect a reply in 3-5 business days. It's been a month so when I called again last week they escalated it and told me to expect a reply in 24-48 hours... Bunch of liars, I got no reply till now and still checking my options.. Am checking if complaining to the IRS of that office will get me my rights.. If anyone has any experience how to get our rights from those bunch of liars please let me know. Thanks.
Filed my taxes for the 2nd year with H&R Block. First year was great I got all my money back with no problem at all. This year I received state back and am still waiting on Federal. I called H&R Block to check on my status and they already sent the check out, reviewing my information they had put in the incorrect zip code... Yet I already got state back. We filled out a refund replacement form and I also got a statement from my bank so I could direct deposit my money. After 2 incorrect formats of bank forms they accepted my third one. In the last two weeks I have talked to different representatives and have heard different things from each one, pretty sure they record the conversations so I will be looking into that. I was told if I get the correct form in that I would receive my money in 2-3 business days. After calling yesterday to check on the status they said I would not get my money until JULY 17th, after they receive their check back which they sent to the wrong zip code. I have been round and round with this company and I will never get my taxes done by them again. After paying over 200 dollars just for them to file my taxes now I have to wait till they receive their money back to get my own... As far as I'm concerned they cannot withhold my money for 3 months. I have taken this further and I hope to get a good outcome. WORST EXPERIENCE EVER!!
I have used HRB online several times in the past, but this time ended badly. I claim rental income from my mother's home in California. I entered that amount, less expenses, which was $2900. I paid HRB $139 for their extra help, and the advisor said I had to correct the amount of my rental income. He said I had to show the entire amount prior to expenses, $5500, as rental income. It didn't make sense to me, but I followed his expert advice that I was paying for. When I went to pay my local R.I.T.A. taxes, I was informed that my federal return had an error on it; namely, my rental income was added more than once and was incorrect! I was able to chat with someone online tonight who took one look at my return and thankfully, immediately scheduled a refund of the $139. Now I have to file an amendment which will lower my tax amount, but what a pain and disappointment. Never again.
My husband & I had our taxes prepared in Queen Creek at the office by Safeway on Power and Queen Creek Road on February 21, 2015. The elderly lady that did our taxes stated that she had been doing this for over 13 years. We provided all the information required and requested and was expecting a good size tax return, <$10K. Around 4 weeks later, I alerted my husband that we should check on the status of our return. He checked with IRS.gov and they had no record. We called the H&R rep that did our taxes and she stated that our return is still in progress. My husband checked again, with a lot of prompting from me, to find that the IRS still have no record and the H&R office we went to is not responding. We have all the paperwork and signatures prepared and are curious what is going on and if we were taken advantage and our information and return is being fraudulently taken.
Have used them for years but no more. This year a girl that was only there a couple of days working on the side did my taxes. Did not submit my 1099-R and I still don't have my return after a month. It's been totally up to me to figure out the problem and I think they now owe me money because they didn't do their job completely! H&R could care less and they cost a small fortune! Never again!!!
I have never been so angry at any business like this. They have offices all over the country but the knowledge about the tax return of so called tax professionals is less than 10 percent. They are only here to get your money. Do yourself a favor and never trust them with your return because when it's time to deal with IRS they backout. You are on your own.
My son's tax return check was never received by him. He paid for H&R Block to receive his refund check and send the balance to him via H&R Block Bank. This check was not received as of 30 days after the IRS according to their website "Where is my Refund" said the check was deposited into H&R Blocks account. Went to the office where his taxes were prepared and agent called customer support. We were told that he would have to wait 90 days until another check could be re-sent. When the customer support agent was asked "Why we had to wait so long?" we were just told "it was policy." We could not get any help higher up as there was none as we were informed by the agent (name and ID number withheld). H&R Block does not have proof they sent out the check nor has the check been cased to date according to the H&R Bank. We asked if the check could be cancelled and a new one cut and was told again this was not possible. So now he sits and waits 90 to 100 more days to get what is his... we hope! H&R Block obviously does not stand behind their product or service and seems to operate with problems. I would recommend anyone who is ever considering using this service to think twice!!
UPDATE****What a confusing mess! Finally able to a consult with a qualified agent that clearly explained my refund information. I wish that my HR Block rep would have taken the time to explain what signing a RAC agreement was all about. I am hearing impaired, and the signing processes was hasty. Through the assistance of an outside agent, I was able to learn that RAC basically allows you to receive your money earlier. The HR Block Bank issues payment in advance. This confused me a great deal because my state refund was sent to my personal account, but my federal was assigned to the HR Block Bank. I was worried my refund was sent elsewhere. After numerous calls and written enquiries, I was AT LAST able to understand. The RAC caught me off guard, I really had no idea I had signed up for it (Yes, I should read everything before signing), but the HR Block agent just breezed through everything, I figured it was standard procedure. I was put-off by the "hard sell" of the rep at the end of my appointment. However, I am now satisfied that this matter has been resolved and EXPLAINED. I will not be going back to HR Block in the future.
The tax preparer said she couldn't give me a price before we started and at the end I knew why! It took less than an hour, not a complicated return, and the bill was $375. I have never paid more than $265 and those were way more complicated returns. I voiced my concern and was told she hears that a lot of the time. I called for the manager the next day and I have never heard back. I should have known it was high when they wouldn't tell me the price. Never again! It's a rip off - $375 for less than an hour is criminal.
This is for the first time I am filing for returns in US for 2014. Thought I would go with the professional services being provided by H&R, but in return I am having a nightmare in following up with this people. I have applied for return on 02-FEB. I have gone with this branch specifically because for ITIN (for my wife) in my area I have to apply with a specific consultant (**) in this branch which was about 30 miles. I have filed jointly but I have just got the returns for single. I did not know the approach from there as the IRS site gave as no ITIN number. I approached the consultant again last week of MAR saying I did not get my returns. He asked to come to the office, so on reaching he just said that he would follow up with IRS and update me where I did not receive any in spite of repeated mails and calls to the branch office. The answers from the branch says that he is on vacation and would be back in July. I do not know what to do and they have no answers to that. As this was not working out, I started to find my answers for rejection calling IRS where they said the rejection because of lack of EIN number in the application, they are not able to find the right consultant. Next I started calling for appointment and the people who schedule do not know who would be right consultant for this ITIN when other consultant is not available. As they are not aware I started to have an appointment the people who schedule are not aware when the offices are closed or open and just blindly do the appointment and when I reach on the date of schedule it is just closed. Hmm. When I call them back it is just an apology after all these incidents and they say when would be the next best appointment to be scheduled. I still don't have answers that even if they schedule, the consultant might not be the right person for filing of ITIN. On the whole this has literally screwed me where I had ended up paying 90$ for tax filing when there were people who were doing it for 40$ and all of my colleagues had their returns without any fail. Apart from that my time, and distance of 60 miles up and down and the gas on that all is going on waste still with no answers.
I went to their place of business to sign documents at the 103rd St. office. I was told, I guess, I because of being black, I was told that people don't enter that office without producing an ID. When they started standing to the door collecting ID to enter this day I wouldn't step foot in there. My husband would have to finish the business at that office. We didn't need ID to drop documents off at their office.
I tried to purchase state software through the H&R Block tax software. My card was declined so I re-entered the information. That did not work so I tried a different card and got the same "card declined" message. So I went online to check my cards and found out that every time they said card declined, H&R Block had charged me! I called them and they said "Sorry, call back tomorrow when tech support is in." If they can fraudulently steal my money on Sunday they should be able to answer the phone. Never again with H&R Block. Why should I ever trust them with my information again?
We went through all our paperwork but were missing one bank account file. It was less than one thousand dollars in savings. Accountant said no problem, just bring it in tomorrow and complete the filing. We were expecting a return of around $4000 as usual. My wife returned the next day with the file. Accountant then started discounting all of the numbers she had previously quoted until we were down to $200 return which would come from H & R block instead of the government. I was not there and my wife is not savvy. In short, they stole our return. A few months later I needed my previous paperwork for a home loan and it turns out they had kept our previous returns and refused to give them back for less than an incredible ransom.
I dropped off the papers and answered the questions and it had been since 2009 since I used them but I didn't feel like the hassle this year. I didn't bring up the fee, I thought they would bring it up. My husband came to sign and pick the papers up and for a refund of $300. They wanted us to pay them $260. I said no, I said for what a is basically a E-z file. No rental properties, nothing to warrant the heavy duty filing. I said "give us our forms back" and we walked out. Not more than 10 days later we get a letter from H&R Block, I thought to myself "cool, they have written to apologize." Wrong, inside was a check for over $7000.00 and hard to read line for you to deposit in your account. Scam. I realize did it come from them or someone else? Should I turn over to Post Office?
I prepared my tax return for this year and for last year with H&R Block at the same office at 16 Ave Calgary Office. I am surprised that H&R Block, one of the biggest companies in tax preparation and filing, does not have a clear and announced tax preparation fees. There is no clear answer or estimation on the preparation fees. Prior start tax preparation, I was asking about the tax preparation fees and I have been told that "we do not know, the system will calculate it for you by end of tax preparation process." I was expecting it will be almost same as last year. However, the surprise was that it increased by 30% with no clarification or justification. My spouse has the same exact tax preparation like last year (last year she paid $133 and this year you asked me to pay $175. I have tried to get an answer on the 30% increase (last year my spouse and I paid 308$ and this year you asked for 400$) and I have been told by the office supervisor (**) that it is national increase and we do not know why they increase it and we do not have any control on that. Then, I have contacted both the customer service and the district manager to get an answer on my below concern. Why there is no clear and announced fees list? Your customer cannot know how much he/she will pay till end of the process. Does it make sense? Is that legally accepted? The district manager ** answer was amazing answer to me. I realized they are very professional team. As per his email to me he said "H&R Block publishes a pricing matrix on our internal website that all of the Tax Professionals have access to." I am not sure why it is not announced to the customer. Why do they keep it internal? A lot of question marks. Why do you increase the fees by 30% this year? He, district manager **, thankfully emailed me back with a very professional answer. He said "annual increases in pricing take into account the increase in costs to us such as rent, labour, utilities etc." I am not sure if does make sense to have an annual increase in cost by 30%. He continued his answer saying "If you do not feel that our prices are competitive you are more than welcome to retrieve your slips from the 16 Ave office and have your tax returns filed elsewhere." That is how they deal with their customer after wasting their times in tax preparation. Actually, I decided to go back and pay because I do not have time to redo the same process again. Here, I am putting my experience for other's benefits to save other's money and hassle. I have a lot of documented technical errors that have been done by their professional staff. H&R Block has ONLY a big name.
I sat in the H&R Block office in July of 2014 & had my taxes filed (or so I thought). I left with a tax packet containing copies of my paper return. They had filed my return electronically. I had an extension, that's why I was filing late & I was going to owe the IRS so I wasn't expecting a check. I had never owed the IRS before so I wasn't sure how long it would take them to try to collect. I was concerned, over the next few months, since I never heard anything. But I wasn't looking forward to paying so I just thought this must be normal, or something. I filed my 2014 taxes, in the office, with H&R Block and I was supposed to get a return. Obviously, I knew I wouldn't get the money. The IRS would. When a check showed up in the mail, I freaked out. I called the IRS to ask them why they hadn't kept it & was told that my 2013 taxes has not been processed. To be exact; H&R Block had submitted them. They had been rejected for some name difference or something & H&R Block NEVER resubmitted them. They just left it unfinished. H&R Block has redone the paperwork and I have it to mail. I haven't been hit with the fines yet bc to the IRS my 2013 tax return doesn't exist. We'll see how H&R Block handles this. I purchased their "Peace of Mind" insurance.... I sure hope they step up to the plate and handle this. Their customer service has been great. My only problem is that they didn't follow through with filing my tax return. Since this is their ultimate responsibility, I kinda think it's a big screw up.
A local H&R Block rep did my taxes. I paid nearly $400 for his services. I questioned the refund while sitting in his office because the refund was significantly lower than other years. He did not review it but just said it was correct. When I got home and looked closely at my return, I realized that I did not get all of my exemptions. We filed a paper amended tax form. According to their web page, a refund of the tax prep fees will be refunded if an error is found. I filed a complaint and was told that someone would call me and get details in 3-5 business days. This was weeks ago, still no call. I've called the customer service/support line many times requesting my tax prep fees. Still no call. I told them that I am very upset and that I have referred many clients to them. I've asked many (4) of their reps for the corporate address because I want to send a letter. All of them told me that they don't know the corporate address. I can't find it anywhere. I'm at a loss what to do to get my refund. I am wondering exactly what kind of a business this is. I told them the last time I called that I am expecting my tax prep fee in full and that if I don't hear from someone soon, I may have to resort to posting negative comments about their business. Still no call. I am beginning to think that if they don't call clients back, they won't have to refund the tax prep fees. VERY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!
The last two times I had my taxes prepared by h&r block I felt as if they are making up the fee based on my refund. My yearly returns are nothing special, always similar to the year before. I always ask about the fee before we begin. They give me one price and after they file they always try to jack up the fee. When I protest they tell me oh but this and that and blah blah - if you're giving me a price then that's the price, don't try to add on another 100 dollars. Also, this year I was given an emerald card and was told my refund will be loaded directly onto this card. The card was quickly shoved into my hand along with the rest of my paperwork. I was never asked if I wanted direct deposit to my bank account, nor did I even think it was an option because this stupid emerald card was presented as a direct deposit. Well it isn't and it comes with tons of fees and penalties attached to it. Very sneaky. When I called and asked for direct deposit into my bank account they said it was too late. I will never do business with them again. In my opinion they are thieves who nickel and their clients to death.
I filed federal taxes using H&R Block online and then amended those. A few days later I decided to use the service to file my state tax even though it was pricey ($40) relative to the refund I was getting. It was inconvenient that all the information didn't import from the federal return and I had to drag all my papers back out. After I agreed to fee and pressed the 'File my Return' button, I got an error message that they couldn't efile my state return because I'd filed an amended federal return. I paid $40 for nothing and in my opinion, H&R Block should have disclosed that fact prior to completing the transaction.
H&R Block rep ** Spring Forest Road, Raleigh NC did not return messages requesting an amended tax return for the prior return which he prepared for an individual taxpayer. Additional calls were required to solicit a return phone call from Mr. **. When he finally called back he was irate and unprofessional. Mr. ** was defensive about his work and refuses to assist the taxpayer by amending the return. Mr. ** said he asked about the deductions the first time he prepared the return however since the taxpayer was a new LLC naturally there were filing fees paid, etc that were not inquired about and such deductions were missed by Mr. ** in preparing the return. The taxpayer has lost confidence in ** H&R Block and is now working with a CPA for resolution.
The tax preparer not only took 2 hours to prepare our taxes, she didn't finish my husband's city tax form which left us to do ourselves. We were then charged an outrageous price of $400. After filing and sending out payment to for the money we owed for federal, H&R Block called us 5 days later to say they forgot a form and that we owe the federal another $500. On top of that, they stated we were responsible for penalty and owed H&R Block another $24 before we could even file THEIR screwup!! I would never recommend H&R Block to anyone!!
I wish there was a no-star rating here. I am very disappointed and will never recommend this place to anyone. Overpriced and not really helpful. ** did my taxes, I have 1099's and own my own business. I did not make a lot of money last year and had to pay more than 20% after she did my taxes. If you want to pay more money than you earn, please go to her. She on top, charged me more than $500 to do the taxes! I went back and talked to the manager and he gave me $130 back saying that "next time, go to him, he would do things differently..." really? So I guess the charges weren't really fair in the first place and the taxes weren't done right. What a waste of money this place is. They pride themselves saying they will guarantee the best refund, it is a total lie. I even had to pay a penalty for not having insurance and I did have medicaid all year. She did not ask me that and said that since I did not get paperwork, then I had to pay the $95 penalty. Not knowledgeable and did not care about my last year taxes either, which I made myself. This year I am going back to TurboTax! So much better. Don't waste your money with these people. THEY DON'T CARE!
I will never go to H&R Block again in life. It's been over two months and still no solution or anything. They got paid to do the job and did nothing but cause problem. I will never, never go there and wouldn't refer anything. They are money grubbing blood suckers.
Spent a bunch of time, over 2 hours, with a specialist, had technical difficulties with their software and then charged me $500 to file a return. Their specialist had little knowledge of tax law. I'll never do it again and will make sure that I post how bad the experience was on every social site I belong to!!
My husband and I just filed our taxes, 4/14. We were charged 338$ to do paperwork and have to pay 800$ back. He was unemployed until Sept. Lady was very nice though, but never mentioned any deductions or expenses for my uniforms or anything. Also penalized for no medical, we had to drop in April because I left a job and couldn't afford premiums. Received a tax break but was taken back off us because he cashed in 401k in May and didn't notify Marketplace about it. What's Marketplace have to do with it if we didn't have insurance when we cashed 401k in? Will NEVER go back.
I turned my tax information into the Scottsboro location 6 times - they lost it 5 times. Then quoted me 79.00 and after finally completing the taxes told me to pay 324.00. When I asked why the difference I was told I would pay what they told me to pay and them losing my taxes was my problem. I have contacted the corporate office to see what steps to take.
The Emerald Card is a piece of crap. Went to my bank to transfer funds out of it, got rejected twice. Went outside to the ATM and it only allowed me a portion of my funds. If I was told I would NOT be able to use the card to deposit to my bank I wouldn't have ever bothered with it. Can't complain about the tax personnel as they did their job properly. I won't be using them ever again due to this.
My brother was told by your agent that he owes $19,000 for the past 3 years. He was charged about $875. He just happened to meet someone who is a CPA and asked her to do the taxes over and he is getting $2,600 back. Don't trust this company. These agents are not CPAs.
This is the worst site to use to file your taxes. They will debit your account before filing your taxes and send you a email 2 day later for you to complete the filing. I filed and paid on 4/13/15 and received a email on 4/16 at 12:16 am, 16 min after the deadline. Thanks H&R BLOCK. YOU SUCK!!!
Our visit to H&R block was a shock to say the least! I am disabled and draw social security and my wife is retired and on social security, so our taxes are very straightforward and simple return. After filing our taxes out, I was told the bill was $371.00!! Their excuse for such a high bill was blamed on Obama Care! I will never again use H&R block!!! This is outrageous!!!
I wasn't able to do my taxes using this software. The state software wasn't able to sync with federal return. I advise anybody buying this software do it over the phone rather than online. I wasn't able to get a hold of their customer support. They put me on hold for 11/2 hour, nobody answered the phone. I tried chatting the same problem.
The company did provide an unprompted refund which happened to be the same as the amount of extra taxes they forced me to pay on my state return. Still a lot of aggravation and meant I overpaid my quarterly taxes for 2015.
The most unprofessional people at the office located at 91st and Union Hills in Peoria, AZ. Quoted one price for having taxes done and then double the price. Tax preparer couldn't get his computer to submit both federal and state taxes, had to do it 3 times, wasted over 2 hours of my time. Next time just going with TurboTax. Would NEVER RECOMMEND this office or any H&R Block office to anyone. Save your money, go elsewhere.
First of all, for years I had the pleasure to work with ** at Jackson Hewitt for years. And love what she can do for me to get as much money back. Jackson Hewitt's fees were considerable but their office was located 45 minutes away. Unfortunately, this year ** was no longer at Jackson Hewitt. I was bummed to hear that. So on 4-13-15, my husband and I decided to go to a local H&R Block in our small town. The lady who was preparing our taxes was slightly pleasant. However, she did not offer to itemize deductions, or other ways for us to get more money back. We usually get at least $3,000 with Jackson Hewitt doing our taxes. And the lady at H&R Block also did not offer the option to set installment payments if we owe either the federal or the state. We owe $1,005+$12 that was not disclosed to us if they electronically withdraw from our checking account. Not one mention from her about installment payments. So today the state will automatically deduct $1,017 from our checking account. To conclude, H&R Block charged us $276 to file our taxes whereas, Jackson Hewitt charges us ONLY $194 last year. They did pretty much the same stuff every year but Jackson Hewitt did more for us to get the maximum amount of money back. Finally, H&R Block did not offer a discount if we used them this year if we used another tax preparation service the previous year as mentioned in their television commercials. This is false advertisement. I WILL NEVER GO BACK TO H&R BLOCK FOR TAX PREPARATION AGAIN. Now I feel better as I got that off my chest. Thank you Consumer Affairs for allowing us consumers the right to complain and give the public some feedback of this RIP OFF of a company.
My husband and I witnessed two people that were unfairly charged: the first lady was quoted $95.63 and because she couldn't pay till the following week, they charged her $115 and another lady was charged $241.00. They also said the price is being raised again next week... We walked out of the office... Our appointment was for 11 am and they were 15 minutes behind also... We have decided to use Liberty Tax service!
I was satisfied with the preparation of my taxes. My complaint involves how much they charge for their service - $323, for a simple filing. Shame on me for not checking first.
I just became self employed last year so I wanted someone to do my taxes for me. The last time I went to an accountant, with my wife self employed, it cost me about $175. I figured it would be about the same level of service and cost. Boy was I wrong. The first red flag should have been when the man doing our taxes did not know where to find my job title in his system...Real Estate Agent. The second red flag was when he did not want to look at my business bank account at all. The third red flag should have been when I noticed he was not asking any specific questions about well anything. I felt like he was filling out turbotax online while I was sitting there. By the way, turbotax got more in depth. At the end of the hour, he came up with the cost of $500 including the direct deposit fee. We were completely blown away. Nowhere in my mind could I fathom that experience costing triple the cost of a CPA and 5 times the amount of turbotax online. Oh, and when I called HR Block's "Escalation Team" they told me all they can do is let the office manager know and the man that helped us may receive more training. I laughed at woman on the escalation team and had to ask what the purpose of her department was since they do not offer any sort of refund nor does the office. I was told that I "paid for a service" so they were not going to refund me anything. H&R Scam.
I had my taxes done with this company for the 2nd time. Last year went smoothly, this year not at all. I set up for the best of both. I entered what I could and then brought my taxes out and had the gal do the rest. It took her a week to do this and file them. After she filed I found out that she itemized this year so she had me email her what I paid for insurance, prescriptions and then what I paid to have my taxes done last year. I sent this email on 4/2/15 and she still hasn't plugged in the 3 numbers that I gave her. It is now tax day and she hasn't done crap and now I am freaking out thinking should I send in my check and then wait for them to refund what I paid plus what I should be getting. The WORST I have experienced in tax prep before!!! Never again. They can't seem to get it straight!!!
I am a student who actually owes $0 in taxes but must still file state taxes (not federal). I clicked "no thank you" for upgrading to basic from free for federal taxes and I had to manually type in my information. Yet, H&R Block still charged me the $15 for an upgrade. I then spent several hours on 3 different occasions waiting on the phone AND waiting to chat online with a representative. I still have not been able to get in touch with a representative. This is poor customer service as well as deceptive service. I plan to change my review if I receive a positive response from customer service and/or a refund.
Time consuming is an understatement, try complete waste of time. Be prepared to be transferred from one under qualified employee to the next and to spend hours on the phone just to find they don't have a solution. Save yourself the trouble. Thinking about having your tax return filed at one of their locations? DON'T. Again you will regret it. Not only is it a complete rip off but if you run into any issues there will be a complete run around between automated systems and department transfers back and forth leaving you with unanswered questions and no solutions. I filed my federal at one of their locations and was told it would be very simple for me to file my state online being that it was half the price and the return was minimal. I would have rather forked out triple the money than to deal with their customer service ever again. Three hours on the phone with no solution. WHAT A JOKE.
Moved from NY to NC. Had ALWAYS used H&R Block. Got someone named ** last year who treated me like the enemy. Argued at every chance, and NEVER explained anything to me. Cost me big time. This year I went to The Tax Ladies in Brunswick County, NC. Shocking NEWS!!! I got what they call a "refund". Personally, stay way, way away from H&R Block. I was counseled re my taxes by the Tax Ladies, and should NEVER, EVER have to write the IRS that check again.
After seeing the HR Block commercial on TV about having taxes prepared at 50% of last year's cost, I was all in. In the past, a local CPA charged me $60 to do my taxes. Unfortunately, Ms. CPA has retired. My taxes are very basic, other than one child, nothing else to claim. Long story short, HR Block charged me 246.00 to prepare my taxes. After stunned silence from both my wife and I, Mrs. HR Block Lady cut the charges to 200.00 even. When I asked her about that 50% off from the commercial, she stated that that ended in March. When we asked her why it was so expensive, she hemmed and hawed about the forms and whatnot. Are you kidding me? Forms? She sits at a computer with preloaded software and punches in numbers that she is reading from material that I supplied her. The commercial says "Get your billions, America!" Perhaps they meant "Pay your billions, America!" I have learned my lesson, NEVER USE H&R BLOCK AGAIN!!!
I had to ask about the fee before the process was started and the price was identified as an average. I felt it was not out of the ordinary although a bit higher than I would have wanted. I was figuring at the most, another $50-$75 at max because I have two state forms. It was not explained further how fees are calculated and I didn't ask. I was shocked at the $430 price when finished. I had no choice but to pay because I had waited too long to get my taxes done. I did however get refunds from all my filings so at least the fee was all I had to pay. They are also looking over my past three years as part of the service (free) so if I get money back from that then I will be happier.
I went to my local H&R block office to file my taxes this year because my employer had a data breach with the company that does our payroll and myself and many of my co-workers had our identities stolen and a fraudulent return was filed in my name. I had always used H&R block online - did it myself and e-filed for free and a fee for filing my state taxes online. I brought all my info in and explained to them why I needed to file a paper return. The lady helping us was nice, it took about 1 hour - 2 W2s, 1 1099misc, itemized deductions, pretty standard, I do it myself usually every year with no problems. When it came time to pay she told me $500!!! I was shocked. My husband owned a business several years ago and we used to do our taxes with an accountant - to do his business and our personal taxes it was $400. I was in such shock - I just paid with my CC and said to my husband never again. However I just got a form CP12 from the IRS, the return was full of errors!!! My refund amount was reduced by over $700. It's cheaper to use a REAL accountant.
I have used this office for 10+ years and before 4 or 5 years ago they had grade A+++ service and knowledge. Now they are rude and just don't know what they are doing. Due to their mistakes our return needs amended to correct their ridiculous error and corporate said this would be done and waiting for us to pick up. Each of the 5 times we went to get it ... not done. We have called corporate 3 times and they promised they would "make the owner" make this right and do amended and refund our fees. Still nothing done. I have been talked to more rude by ** than I have ever been spoken to in my life. No wonder this business is going down the tubes and everyone says don't go there if the last resort. Tonight I drove 35 miles away to Camdenton H&R office and they said that the owner of the Lebanon office has deleted my 2014 return off the server. So they can't help with amended. This proves they have something bad to hide.
For the last 18 years I have been filing my taxes with my personal tax representative, and in 2013 I decided to use H&R Blocks On-Line Deluxe service. On March 23RD 2015 I receive a notice for the IRS Form CP2000 which states I left out my wife's wages and tips for the year 2013 on the form 1040. I had no itemized deductions for the record. The software did not pick up my wife's tax information which now I owe the IRS 2,400, plus for the mishap or glitch in the software for 2013. I had both My Wife's W-2 and My W-2 while I did our taxes as Married Filing Jointly with SS # on the 1040 form. I know I entered the information for my wife but, software did not pick up my wife's W-2. It could be that the software has a time out when doing taxes and does not save your information? And it is possible that I did not enter my wife's information off of her W-2. But I find that hard to believe that after 18 yeas of marriage and filing taxes every year as Married filing Jointly, that I would not put my wife's wages on to the 1040 form. And it seems to me that when I filled out the 1040, that my wife's Social Security number was on the form. I do not know my wife's SS and do not understand why I would enter her SS and not the rest of the information for the 1040 form. My wife and set up an appointment with H&R block in our area and had a representative go over our 2013 taxes. She said it looks like the IRS form CP 2000 amount I owe is correct and that I had forgot to enter in my wife's information/wages and tips. I told the H&R Block Rep. that I was not disputing the amount I would owe the IRS because of the missing tax information, what I'm disputing is the fact that I felt there was a glitch in the software. I called H&R Block support and got know where about my issue. So here I'm taking the full responsibility which I feel I cannot prove my conclusion to this glitch.
H&R Block promised a free efile. After entering 45 minutes of info I was brought to a page that offered nothing but an upgrade to a paid addition to continue with my federal return.
How does H&R Block charge clients? I was charged $394 ($35 of which is the protection if audited). I have a VERY SIMPLE tax return and can't understand why I was charged such an overpriced amount. Last year I was charged $279 and I thought that was a lot. I have emailed ** in San Francisco at your Geary Blvd location for an explanation but he has not responded to my email. I did notice a sign that said $275 for an hour. I WASN'T there an hour!! I thought the charge was $294 which was acceptable to me. Again, my tax return is extremely simple. I am 65, receive social security and work part time. I have tried to do my taxes myself with the H&R Block computer disk but it's impossible if you're in my situation. Their accountant agreed with me that it's not really possible to do it online myself. I am extremely upset and disappointed with H&R Block's fee structure!!!
I had H&R Block do my 2014 federal and state income tax returns. I didn't ask them what their charge was, assuming their fee would be fairly standard and competitive ($100-200). But neither did they provide me with an estimate as to what they would charge me for doing my taxes. So I was shocked and outraged when they told me I owed them $558.00. Their explanation was that my return was complicated by the fact that I had income in two states and that my work in one state had to be treated as "self-employed" income. But they never told me that this would result in a significantly higher fee for doing my taxes. If I'd known this, I'd never have had them do my taxes. I certainly won't be seeking their services again and will warn everyone I know away from them.
I filed my federal return online and was not able to file my state taxes online. I thought all was OK because I chose to pay for the Best of Both with my federal return. Big mistake! II filed an appointment and was told I couldn't be helped by her because she didn't "specialize" in the service and it is not easy to find someone who does. I was not able to easily find someone to help me with my state taxes because that is something they wouldn't get paid for because I had already paid online. It is a huge hassle to find anyone willing to return my call who would be willing to help! It looks like I'll be paying (again) for my state taxes to be done. I will NOT be paying H&R Block again. I will not be using H&R Block in the future and I will make sure everyone I know will know to avoid this company.
On April 8 2015, I went to H&R Block to do my taxes. For three years, I've been out of work due to a work injury. Last year, I withdrawn my retirement fund due to hardship. 10% of taxes was taken out before I got the money, but I was told I had to file it cause the retirement fund company did not know that the 10% percent would be sufficient for Hawaii tax code. So I went to H&R Block, took them only 15 min to do my taxes which only $75.00 is coming back from state taxes and H&R Block charge me $386.00 to do my taxes. That's a complete rip off. They don't have any shame on their charges on an unemployed person.
Just filed my family taxes with H&R Block 4/7/15 because of fafsa time restraint due to surgeries. We are all dependents -grandmother and children- under my head of household mother who is a contractor for military ship. We got charged for $213 for a single simple W2 (x3) no deductions from anything filing. My mother owes $3600 plus for federal. I did this W2 (x3) Paper filing my senior in H.S. for part time jobs and college; I could charge $25. I got about $3000 back total from state and federal. We used a CPA for the past years while I was sick for $150 for everything. We filed-contractor (gas, rentals, training, med, living exp ded) 9mo work and 3mo training deductible; myself (student, disabled, single-mom, home-school teacher, living exp); great grandmother (parent dependent, disabled, med and living exp); and my son (grandchild, student and living exp). As head of house hold (includes property not in her name but as a trust, all maintenance, all expenses). IT LOOKS like a lot, but we tallied up the receipts and donations ourselves and have all receipts since 2010. It’s actually not a lot, if receipts and docs organize each individually first. HR block didn't bother with any of it. He wanted $700 for the biz filing for my mother being contracted, and house to myself in Hawaii 2014 because my grandmother passed on, which wasn't worth it. I'm trying to stop the tax from being filed and amend it myself back to turbo tax or my CPA back in California who charged $230 for biz/self employee contracted.
We got an appointment to file our taxes. It took them more than 1 hr to enter everything. Person was not knowledgeable, it was a very simple one file - state and federal, no mortgage or anything. I even had with me last year filing. I kept asking her why she was taking standard deduction and not itemized, she said that it did not qualify and the software did not allow it. They took 500 for filing our taxes. I was not convinced and I did it manually and found out that she did not take CA taxes into consideration and that was the reason of miscalculation. I had to take another appointment at Preston Center, Plano and the manager ** agreed that was a mistake and filed the amendment but did not reduce the fees though it was their mistake and they do not even return our calls as we wanted to check on the status of amendment. The mistake was couple thousand dollars. Very bad experience.
Be warned. Last year was my first time to H&R Block. They charged me 50.00 to do my taxes. I make under 15,000 a year. This year I went back expecting another 50.00 charge to do taxes again. Not only did I OWE 800.00 to the state, I also owed H&R BLOCK a big whopping 250.00! They never disclosed what they were charging me and when I asked the preparer about it all she said was "Sorry, it's too late, you must pay what you owe for the time (20 min)." I never ever will recommend or go back to H&R BLOCK.
We've used H&R for the last three years. Simple return, W-2s for my wife and me. We didn't have a printer at tax time in 2013, so we started using them. Since then, we have a printer but H&R was easy and cheap. We paid $50 in 2013, $50 in 2014 ($80-$30 coupon) AND $271 JUST TODAY FOR THE SAME SITUATION! I scanned my card to pay for it and saw $271. In the meantime the tax preparer **, who did the taxes (and the last two years) was talking to my wife about a sale at market nearby. I asked the person at the desk if the amount was correct. She asked ** if it was correct and ** said it was correct. I asked **, "$271!! For what you just did?! It was $50-$80 the last few years!" From that point, it's kind of a blur. I remember hearing my wife talking to ** and ** saying that it's because of the time of the year. My wife grabbed my arm, and at that point and I just paid it, and we left. Does anyone know if they raise rates within a certain time period? We filed on 4/2/2013 ($50) and 4/8/2014 ($80-$30- coupon) and 4/10 this year ($271). I found info on H&Rs earnings and it seems like they are doing well. At our expense? Someone smarter than myself should look at the trend. See page 22 of their annual report: **. Nevertheless, done!
H&R Block is the most unprofessional company ever. They lie to you, don't return calls, blame you for the mistakes they've made and could NOT be more RUDE about it all. They screwed us. Thinking the rudeness was just at the one office, we found out that it is apparently company policy, to treat paying clients like crap. I would highly recommend anyone else do your taxes. We will NEVER deal with them again. After months of nothing but the run around from them, we found out they had held our taxes captive and we couldn't even file elsewhere. They ultimately filed without our approval, after repeatedly telling them they were not authorized to do so. BEWARE. They are so shady. We are truly blown away that a company this big is so inept.
I went to H&R Block this morning for the first time ever. My taxes have always been very simple, but this year was a bit more complicated as I was self-employed for a period of time. I needed to amend my taxes and needed assistance. I figured I didn't know anything about this, but it should be a breeze for a tax professional. I was wrong. After explaining my situation, my preparer seemed completely stumped. He asked me to show him I had already filed online, which I did, but it wasn't the information he needed. All he needed to know was what forms I had filed, and what I didn't. I showed him which ones they were but he didn't seem to believe me. He called someone else to assist and they discussed it amongst themselves, trying to figure out what I had done already instead of just asking me. Eventually they understood what I needed (ie, listened to what I had been telling them over and over already). It should have been obvious from the beginning but whatever, I made the situation complicated for them so it was alright. Then the preparer I met with initially asked the other guy to do it instead. The other guy said he was busy. My preparer said he was uncomfortable filing it, and the other guy tried to tell him to do it anyway! I told them I don't care if I have to leave it, I want someone who knows what they're doing to do my taxes. He told me it would be $149. That seemed reasonable for the situation, so I filled out the forms and signed the arbitration thing. They told me there was no obligation, but I still wanted the price they quoted me in writing as I've been burned by other places before. They absolutely refused to give me anything about the price in writing. When I asked why they wouldn't, the guy acted personally insulted that I asked and said that H&R Block had been in business such and such years, there wasn't any obligation, and if I didn't like how they did business I could go elsewhere. I explained that other places of business have surprised me before and I didn't want that to happen. I tried several times to pin him down on assuring me that it would cost NO MORE than $149, but all he could say was that it "shouldn't" cost more unless there were things I hadn't told him and dodged around the question. I've never done business with anywhere reputable that would not give you a quote up front. After reading the reviews here I have a feeling it would have ended up costing me substantially more, and I didn't want to leave my documents with them for a few days only to have to be quoted some ridiculous amount and have no choice because the deadline was coming up, especially since I was going to be owing taxes already. Maybe everything would have been fine, but I had a very bad feeling about both the competence of the preparers and their method of doing business, and left upset and angry. Clearly customer satisfaction is not important to H&R, and after reading the reviews here I am happy I decided not to do business with them.
I have filled tax with help of H&R block on Jan 28th and it's been more than 2 month and it's still stuck. No one responds well from their end. They keep on saying wait for a while. I am in India now and it's difficult to call back them every night. I will not recommend anyone to go for it.
Horrible service in over 45 minutes late at the 220 Sansome H&R Block location in San Francisco. Never go there!
We went to H&R block, have been for many years, took preparer about 20 minutes to do our return which we owe taxes to both federal and cause we had a distribution last year, we were charged 299.50!!! This is crazy!! We did not pay half as much as this last year not to mention that is what we have to pay into federal... She said “it was because of more forms that had to used”, still this is too much!!! They get you in and prepare your taxes then you find out how much your fee is and like us we just saved enough to pick them up from a month ago!!! Now I have to call both fed and state to set up payment plans. We will not be going back next year, never again!!!
Went for tax preparations for my husband and myself. I was quoted $100 over the phone and they proceeded to charge me $382 for a simple tax return! Duh. When I went to pick up my taxes to be sent out, my tax preparer told me to close my business and find a real job. They did nothing for me because there were no errors in my taxes! STAY AWAY!
I went in to see H&R Block six weeks ago to start my taxes. The person I saw was named ** from VT H&R Block. She was every bit a tax professional and was not a very friendly person. We started the taxes and I forgot some information so I had to bring it back later. My kids are twin boys. They are a little rough and tumble. So they were making some noise, and running around like kids do. Well it was six weeks later I had finally got around to getting the stuff I needed. I brought it in. It was just a couple of things. She could have finished my taxes in a few minutes because she had already inputted the wages of my wife and myself. I called a couple. By the way I am having money problems this month because the VA withheld over 2000.00 of my retirement because I owed money for back pay from the military. I told them I needed and extension because I had no money to pay them. But I wanted them to do the taxes and I was going to see if I could borrow some money to at least pay them to do my taxes and file them. I called them today and ** got on the phone and said that she did not think I wanted my taxes done but I told her I did. She said it had been six weeks and I was way down on the list because of the six weeks and because I told them I did not have the money because of the VA mess with my pay, that I would need to file an extension till the first till I could pay them. So she was really snooty on the phone and just hung up. Well I went to get my tax documents so I could have someone else do them for me and work out a plan of attack. Well ** came up to the front counter and told, "Make this the last time you come into this office," and she tried to say she lost business due to my kids being loud which I know this is a lie because the place was not crowded with people. It is to the credit of H&R Block that I owe 3000.00 dollars from 2013 because I did my own taxes but had a question and the women told me that if the amount of my refund does not change after I put in another amount, to not worry about it. I thought she knew what she was talking about but obviously she did not and now I owe 3000.00 dollars. Oh, and the old bag that was sitting at the desk was ass too.
For about 10 years I used a tax preparer who would charge us $150. Our tax person had gotten sick in 2010, so I used a CPA who charged me $275. His preparation was nothing different than our prior experiences with our previous tax person. Seeing that there was nothing special about our situation (House/Kids/RV... NOTHING ELSE) in 2011, I started using TurboTax. I purchased from Costco for about $49. 2011-2013, we had basically the same returns as before. This year, I again purchased TurboTax. TurboTax calculated that we owed about $26,000 for 2014. Seeing all the commercials about how great H&R were, I figure that if they could find something I was missing and knock my bill down substantially, they would be well worth the money. I scheduled our appointment and asked the receptionist what the fee would be and she said, "It Varies", but should be about $300. Still a little pricey, I decided to go with them. The lady who prepared our taxes at H&R Block was very nice. We were there for 1 and 1/2 hours and she filed a 1040 (Individual Income Tax Return), 2210 (Underpayment of Estimated Tax by Individuals, Estates, and Trust), Schedule A (Itemized Deductions), 2441 (Child and Dependent Care Expense), 6251 (Alternative Minimum Tax), 8959 (Additional Medical Tax), 8960 (Net Investment Tax), 2106EZ (Reimbursed Employment Business Expense), and an 8283 ( Noncash Charitable Contribution). Most these forms were self-populated from the info on my W2 or info I verbally told her. Again, this was our FIRST time dealing with H&R Block, but it only took 1 and 1/2 hours. The bill ended up being $604. More than $400 per an hour. She knocked us down to $25.5k owed. Wow, a whole $500 from the $26K, but it cost me $600. Net loss was $100. NEVER AGAIN!!
Had my taxes prepared by H&R Block this year from recommendations of my brother. He made the exact same amount of money last year as I, and was charged $100 less than me. He was charged $130 for his tax return, and they hit me with $216 with $25 coupon. Go figure. What a crock, with no explanation. At least, the people were nice there, but still?
Went to get my taxes done because I wasn't sure of few things due to a divorce last year. They had no knowledge about questions I had and guessed their way thru my tax returns. They charged me almost $400 for something I could have done myself in turbo tax and before she even knew exactly what to send the irs she accidentally hit the submit button to send my return. Their answer was I should go to the irs building and tell them what happened. Never go there. It is a huge rip-off and they are scamming people.
Ok so I have been waiting since tax season started to receive my check from H&R block and I just now get a notice that I will have to go in and pay for my return which, don't forget, there is a late fee everyday and I haven’t know this for a couple months so I owe them all this money for no reason and on top of that when I’m able to pay for it I got to wait another three weeks after.
I am retired. I had cancer this last year and I had bought a house. She didn't deduct the full amount for medical or the house I bought. I would have to pay into State with the refund I was getting back from Federal. I was left with $50.00. She spent 45 minutes on the return and billed me over $300.00. It was a pretty straightforward return. I took my return back and went online with TurboTax. I tripled my refund from Federal and paid less to State.
H&R Block Deluxe and State software - I have been using it for years. This year I could not e-file NY state return due to some software bug. Used a chat option on their customer support site. First time around got a case number. Next time I used it: they could not find the case number and closed chat in the middle of the conversation. Now, I am stuck, since NY State requires me to e-file, since I e-filed a Federal return, but a bug in their software won't let me do it. I am not going to use their chat any more. Awful experience that left me in a bind.
238.00 for 10 min of work on a short form, nothing to do but sign here, you don't know what you're signing. What a rip-off. I could of went to Wal-Mart 75.00 for the same return, you get what's left.
We have always used TurboTax, but this year we decided to give H&R Block a try to see if there were deductions we were missing as we always have had to pay. Basically we paid $234.00 dollars for someone to fill in the blanks just as you would do with TurboTax, which by the way we were never told anything about the fees, but our fault, we did not ask. The person that did our taxes was obviously not a tax consultant by any means. As she was filling out the form, she had to read everything as if this were her first time ever using the program. At the end she told us we owed over 5K, there was no way this was correct. We have had to pay, but never more than $1800.00. She had to call someone over to find her mistake, and that was reduced to $2300.00. When we asked some questions as to what we needed to do to keep from paying in the future we got a blank look. Needless to say, we paid the $234.00 and will never use this company again, what's more, I will never recommend anyone, and will tell everyone I know that they obviously employ people who have no clue about tax laws, deductions, etc. I mean, anyone can fill in the blanks, and sure as hell should not have to pay that price for anyone else to do so. Rant over, lesson learned. Beware, this company is most definitely a rip-off!!!
Having successfully used H&R Block's tax program, I scheduled an appointment with H&R Block Premiere Office, as I had to submit a 2014 return based on a complex trust. The northwest Austin office provided the date & time to meet with **, which I accepted. 2 days before the appointment, I received a call to reconfirm my appointment. I arrived 5 minutes before the appointment time and then sat for over 40 mins waiting for her. I was so irate at that point, that I told the receptionist that I was leaving to find someone interested in my business. The receptionist was courteous, but could only offer me "water," which didn't solve the problem.
We ask upfront how much, the girl said $90.00. She said "leave them and when we are almost done we will call you in about an hour." 4 hours later they called us and I was busy so sent my daughter. WOW charged her $275.00. I later looked at her taxes and took them to a good accountant and he could not stop laughing at what a mess they were. He said there is no way a tax person did this, it would be impossible. They filed her as a corporation she is a college student with 3 W-2's and 1 1099. They never called us to go over anything, they never called to tell us it was going to be $275.00. When I called corporate they were no help and told me the person who did her taxes is a receptionist. This place should closed down, at least the one on 21 mile and Card Rd in Macomb, Michigan.
I've used H&R Block for at least 25 years. This time I actually broke even, but felt like I had been robbed when it was time to pay. For the last few years, I've paid approximately $260 which was plenty. This year it was $475!! I'll never use H&R Block again.
Though I liked the tax preparer the $442 was a complete shock!!! I got back $282... I'm using a good friend next time, or I'm going to get Turbo Tax. That was too much money! Won't go back again... :(
We had H&R Block prepare our taxes and paid for the peace of mind coverage. We were audited because of a mistake made by H&R BLOCK. I filed the claim in Nov. 2014 and have contacted them multiple times every month. They keep closing the claim and do not return calls. Stay away from this company!
The lady who did my taxes was very polite. But also very pushy. She made it all too clear that my information could be hacked. And almost that it would be. She judged this off of less than a dozen people out of who knows how many that had been in her office... she made me nervous and therefore got me to pay triple what I expected to pay this year. I feel taken advantage of. And very upset with my outcomes. I've used H&R for the last five years or so. And was always happy. But I will never again use them again. Because this year they used me. Very unhappy and hope you all go to TurboTax instead of these rip offs.
I had an appointment with H&R Block on 4/4/15. My income tax preparation took 1 1/4 hours. I had all info with me. The fee for an adjusted gross income of approximately $21,000 for a retired person was over $500! Even my preparer, a very nice woman, was appalled. She gave me a coupon to reduce it to $453.50. Of course, I'll never go back! They really need to be investigated! CONSUMER ALERT: STAY AWAY!
Just trying to figure out why H&R charges so much!!!!! How do a bunch of Data Entry people get more per hour than my Doctor and Lawyer. I hope the folks working there are getting at least $50 per hour. The only one getting billions is H&R. My advice is to go to a CPA. Smarter, cheaper, faster. Just my 2 cents.
My husband and I normally do our taxes ourselves, but this year with all the changes, we decided to go to H&R block. This was a massive $250 mistake. We filed our taxes on February 2, and 2 months later, we have yet to see our refund. We have been informed by the IRS that we are about to be audited when we called to check the status. H&R Block took it upon themselves to file for Medicare on our behalf because we do not qualify for the ACA. They caused us to lose our SNAP benefits, and our kids' healthcare because they inputted what we made in 1 year as our weekly wage! We are a low-income family, and the loss of our benefits has now caused us to burn through our savings account, and just this week, get evicted. So thanks to H&R Block we have no benefits, no tax refund, a pending audit, and no home. Thanks H&R Block.
On Tuesday, I stopped in the Oxford NC office and set up an appointment for 9:00 am on Friday April 3, 2015. We arrived at the office around 8:55 am. The lady at the desk asked if we had an appointment and we said we had. She asked with whom, and we replied we did not know since our previous preparer, **, for the last 10 yrs+ had recently retired. She asked us to take a seat and someone would be with up shortly. Several minutes later, an associate ** walked in and went to her cubicle. A gentleman then came in and said he had no appointment. When ** came out to inquire who she was assist, the lady at the desk gave her the gentleman. The lady at the desk then disappeared into the back area and we never saw her again. At 9:15 am we left. I finally received a call at 9:29 am on my cell phone presumably from H&R but I lost the connection before answering it. I have since rescheduled an appointment online with **. Believe me, this is H&R's last chance to treat us decently and with respect or we will take our $500+ business elsewhere.
I had terrible experience some 25 years ago - they lost all my paperwork I had to refile. Fool me once, ok; but twice, shame on them. Do not use the Elechester office. They can't get an appointment right.
Went into H&R Block today, I started my conversation off with, "I have a 1900k form from Paypal, the account was set up to accept payment for a not for profit group." Lady said I would have to pay the taxes, I repeated myself several times that none of funds went to me, they all went to the not for profit group. Then she tells me she been doing this for 25 years and have never come across this before. Spoke with 2 other H&R Block employees and none of them had any advise for me. Came home and called an independent tax preparer and explained my situation over the phone and within a few seconds he provided me with all the information I needed to know. Going into a H&R Block office was a waste of my time!!!
We have taken our taxes to H&R for ten years. Never had a problem until this year at FORT GORDON GA. First off, the "manager" did our taxes the first time and left off an earned income credit. We received a note from the IRS that we qualify to get that which was over 1000.00. So we took it back to H&R and the "manager" was gone and another tax professional couldn't figure out the problem. So she set us up the next day with the guy who messed them up in the first place. He filed, said, he fixed them... again. Today about a month later, got a letter from IRS saying they still are not done right. So I will be going back for the fourth time tomorrow. If the only manager is the one who did my taxes, then I’m screwed. Also, whatever happened to giving your refund back if they mess up or don't give maximum refund. I paid over 400.00 to get my taxes done and three months later I’m still fighting with them to get my taxes back. Will never go here again!
My wife and I went to the local H&R Block office to discuss getting my taxes completed with them. After talking for a bit we decided to let H&R block do our taxes. ** was the lady that took the job. We dropped off all of the paperwork she requested the same day which was either March 4th or 5th. The following week ** had to go fishing for a week. The week after that I did not hear anything from her so I called the office on March 17th to find out she was gone fishing for another week. I received a message from ** on Sunday March 29th stating that she was in the office for 10 minutes if I could call her back to discuss some things about my taxes. I did not get the message in time so I called on Monday the 30th. I answered the questions she had. As I thought about the situation I decided to pick up my taxes and have someone else do them. I called and asked the lady that answered to have them ready for my wife to pick up. My wife went by and picked them up but when she got home the photocopy of our social security cards was not with the paperwork. I called H&R block and asked what was done with the paper. The lady stated that she didn't know and ** would call me the next day. When ** called she was very rude and stated that she got the message to call me about the SS card photo copy and that she had returned all that we gave her. I am not one to complain but the way she acted on the phone and telling me that we didn't give her that information was very unprofessional and uncalled for. The fact that she had my taxes for almost a month and have gone fishing two different times for a week at a time during tax season seems a little off as well.
It cost me $427 to file my taxes, more than half of my total return! I'm a full time teacher, and travel at night for graduate school. Having student credits I was anticipating a substantial return, instead I left feeling completely taken advantage of by this outlandish charge. When I was trying to clarify these charges with my "tax professional", I felt rushed out of my seat because the next appointment had arrived. This is a scam, I highly recommend seeking out other services when filing your taxes!
I had may taxes done today at H&R Block and I could have messed up less on my own for free. Not only does the Block charge exorbitant fees, the new computer program that they are using messed up my taxes so bad that it erased my 2014 income when sent to the IRS after I had paid. The program was also acting erratic while my taxes were being prepared. I received a call from my tax preparer after I had left. She told me what had happened and said that I have to wait until the IRS sees the error and then we can amend it. THAT is unacceptable. H&R Block is a billion dollar industry and has been around for years yet shouldn't it beta test its new programs to clean out glitches before it launches them out into the public? This episode has caused me undue stress, is wasting my precious time, and is costing me money AND, this is just the beginning.
As usual I filed my federal and state taxes via H&R Block. I thought it was simple since I had no deductions. I am being charged 297.00 to pay for my taxes which I think is a real ripoff. The person I talked to could care less about what they were charging me. I am going to pay them what I can afford. Don't file with block anymore.
If I Could give this place negative stars, I would. I'm not one to yelp, or do online ranting, but my experience with this specific location, as well as H&R Block customer service to resolve this issue has been horrifying. I made an appointment with a gentleman who was supposedly an accountant for H&R for ten years. When he called me back to his cubicle he asks me "Am I doing your taxes?" I was thrown back considering my appointment was specifically scheduled with him. In the start of my process he didn't even acknowledge when I told him I was referred (because they have a referral program) AND that I was there for the 50% Off Last Years Tax Cost promo. After almost THREE HOURS of me helping him throughout the computer system, suggesting the RIGHT buttons to click, my taxes were $2,000 less than they have ever been in previous years, and he charged me almost $600 just to file there. When I asked him to explain the drastic differences between this years and last, he told me he couldn't because I didn't have my taxes done there the year before, EVEN THOUGH I brought everything I had from the year before for the 50% off I never received, I was dumbfounded. Because he was the only one left in the office by the end of my "experience" I paid and left. It was obvious he wouldn't be able to help me resolve any of my issues or concerns, figuring I'd call the 800 number the next day to get help. I was told they would send me a refund, to wait 3-5 days for a follow up call. It's been 3 weeks! After a few check in phone calls, where I'm told they are "still investigating" - I have heard nothing. Worst tax experience of my life, and I still have to pay someone else to over look what he did and figure out why I received 2 grand less than ever before. Biggest mistake and regret going to this place!!! Don't do it!!
I sent my husband to get the deluxe software as I have for the past three years and when I went to open I discovered that the deluxe now is not deluxe. In past years, the deluxe had both Federal and State return but this year only Federal. No warning that they changed the definition of deluxe and that it has little to offer over basic. What a scam! Going back to Turbo Tax. I went on their website and could not find an email address to send a complaint directly, so I am thankful for this site to voice my complaint and warn others.
My wife and I used H and R Block this year for the first time and they shafted us too. They refused to give us a price until they were done. Our bill was also $400!! We will never use them again. Crooks!!
Since Turbo Tax had a problem with hacking recently, I thought it wise to go to a nearby H&R Block office for my 2014 tax filing. I was told the price would be around $375 because I needed schedules B, C, and D completed. $375 seemed awfully high so I elected to stay with Turbo Tax again this year and ended up paying $91.50 which included both Federal and State returns. Schedules C and D were not required.
I went and got my taxes done (federal, state, and local). I had to pay state tax (387.00) which I never had to pay. When I got home I noticed the state tax was deducted from my refund. I was told I still had to pay it. I am confused why I have to pay twice? I have called H&R several times and they will not return my calls. I pay $273.00 which was ridiculous. I will never go there again. Besides, I do get a refund for 4 to 6 weeks and was charged the rapid refund. I feel ripped off.
Even though we are Canadian, we file a US tax return yearly to recoup taxes withheld from gambling wins. Generally we use H&R Block in Canada to file an "NR" return. (non resident). Up to this year, filings have gone smoothly, except for last year, when the mail didn't get to the US tax office from Canada. We had to refile. Since we live in the US for 3 months over the winter, we decide that in order to avoid the mail problem again we would send from our Fort Myers address, feeling like US to US address should mitigate mail complications. We have a sizable refund due, and we wanted to use a good tax return firm and ensure that we had it done properly. So we went back to H&R Block who had serviced us well in Canada. The mail service turned out to be the least of our worries after going to the H and R Block office near our winter home in Fort Myers. The agent who took our file on January 27, 2015 started the process and we provided all the information she required and this took about an hour. She said it was straightforward and she would have it done in a couple days. We went back after she said the form was done, to sign off on the form and have it filed. Then, we noticed that she had filed a 'joint' return (my husband and myself) and that the refund amount was different from what we had calculated. We had never filed joint returns in the past, and have been told by the IRS, since we were Canadians, we need to file our returns separately. We decided to review the filing and when we brought up this issue the H&R agent reassured us that the joint filing was fine; it was no problem to do it in that manner. As we went through the filing, we realized that there were significant reporting errors on the return, as we have done these returns 7 years in a row. We then spent well over three and a half hours going through the numbers, the reporting, and finally after "counselling" the H&R Block tax professional we finalized the return. We then asked the H&R Block agent how many she had done like ours, and said "NONE". Of course, we then asked why she had not told us this from the outset, as we would not have spent the time or money on someone or a company which had little experience. She said she was confident she could do it. Frankly we were surprised by this- H&R Block advertises their expertise and their ability to do it right the first time. We as clients should not be asked for advice on how to file the return. That's H&R's business. Unfortunately for us, we then went ahead with the filing as we had spent so much time on it, and then we're told that e-filing was not feasible and it had to be mailed. H&R Block then indicated they would mail it, and we left. We were told that it would take 4 weeks to reach the tax centre in Dallas. WE checked in with the IRS office online after 4 weeks and there was no record of it ever being received. We phoned the H&R Block office in Fort Myers after we checked with the IRS and H&R Block said they didn't keep records of when they mail returns. Very unusual, we thought. The H&R Block agent didn't return our phone calls regularly, and follow-up was very sporadic and ominous, but she indicated she had sent it although she never did answer our straightforward question as to exactly when she mailed it. She asked that we give her proxy to call the IRS on our behalf and we provided the signed forms for her to do it, so she could check with the IRS directly. We have gone online to check our account since the 2 months it was filed. There is no record of the tax office ever receiving it as per our online account. We spoke to the H&R Block office manager at the Fort Myers location and we got the runaround again and we felt based on their response and attitude, that we were "annoying them", so we decided to call customer service at the Head office for H&R Block. They reassured us that they would look into it and assigned a case number after taking all the information. They told us they would call us back in 5-7 business days. We have heard nothing back from them in the weeks we called them, even though they have not returned any calls. We followed up with H&R Block to see why we had not heard from them, and they told us they would get back by "end of day" which they never did. This is just terrible customer service on the part of H&R Block. We did receive an email out of the blue from the original agent on approximately March 15, who originally prepared our taxes who told us that she called the IRS. They told her it had been received and the claim was in good order, there were no problems or errors, and the end of the month it would be posted on our IRS profile. That was two weeks ago, and it still does not show up on our IRS profile. The odd thing is that when we called the IRS (before the H&R Block professional told us the IRS had received the filing and all was in good order) they told us that we should have NOT filed jointly, and that they had not received anything from us. We called back to the H&R Block Head Office today, March 30 and they now indicated they were going "expedite the claim" which we called about on the 13th of March. Two weeks ago. Again, no urgency, no interest in good follow-up or customer service. We would have thought they would have already initiated the claim when we had called originally. We have been very tolerant with this whole situation. We have tried to be understanding and didn't want to create any problems for the agent who did the original filing. We realized her experience was nil; we should have walked out and gone to another tax preparation agency, but our experience in the past with H&R Block in Canada was fine and we felt that in spite of all the effort, all would go smoothly. In this case, we filed over two months ago, no one is interested in providing any information, the IRS of course is difficult to reach and deal with, so we are sitting on our hands, unable to do anything until more information is provided. We are hugely disappointed in the service and expertise we have received from H&R Block in Fort Myers Florida this year in filing our 2014 income tax return. We had expected better. And for the $225 (275$ CDN) we spent, all the unnecessary time we devoted to helping someone who should know how to do these returns, but didn't, and the aggravation and grief with H&R Block over what should be a simple matter, has been been a terrible experience. We really don't know who to contact, where to go or even what to do now. We never should have allowed this to happen.
I received an audit letter in Jan. 2014 for year 2012. I contacted the IRS who told me of what paper work was needed. I called and recorded calling a local H&R Block office and said, "I'd be in" but was told no appt. necessary. I paid for the peace of mind as I have for years with Block. I took my papers in where copies were made and was told they would fax them over and if I received more IRS papers to bring them in. My claim was denied! They said it was because it was not within the 60 days. This is not true. They said they have no records of me coming in within the 60 days. So a couple more claims was denied all with the same answer. I made a complaint with the BBB and the answer that a lady from the executive office gave was that I did not go into my local Block office until I received my second notice from the IRS which by their records was in Feb. 2014 instead of in Jan. 2014 as when I said I was there. I also have a recorded conversation with the same lady and she says that indeed when we filed our 2012 taxes the tax pro did overlook the divorce decree. Ok so that is why this has happened because of a tax pro error and it was admitted by a lady in their executive office! Plus on top of that Feb. is still within 60 days, yet it's been a little over a year of arguing about the peace of mind claim honoring what it promises to honor. I have submitted one more claim to try to handle this at the Block level and it is currently pending. I do have a couple of more recordings that can be used against Block if this must go to a legal level. The IRS is coming after us for the amount and it is not our fault. We paid for the tax service to be correct, not for papers to be overlooked, and we paid for the peace of mind but yet Block has of yet to honor their promise, a promise that is made to anyone who pays for the peace of mind. I just want ppl to be aware of the hassle that Block has put us through so they can make an educated decision to go somewhere else!! I'm very unhappy with Block! TY.
Had a $5.00 rebate for buying H&R Block Deluxe. Sent it in with everything asked for. After 5 or 6 weeks I received an answer that it was missing the original UPC. Since the box had 2 UPCs on it I sent back everything with the second original UPC. Received another email that it was not correct.. This really upset me because I used the program to do my taxes and because of a problem with the program I could not e file. My wife was 64 years old until September 2014. She had health care from NY State market from Jan to August. In Sept she went on Medicare at 65 years old. The program said "Since she had state insurance for 2014 at 65, (which we didn't) we could not e file our taxes. So I mailed them in.
For the Tax Year 2013 I had H&R Block prepare my taxes. First the representative did not compute my quarterly taxes that I had paid correctly and I received a letter from the IRS stating I had paid more than was reported by H&R Block. Then, when I filed my taxes in 2014 I found out I owed the IRS $1,490.00 in self-employment taxes from 2013 which H&R Block never advised me about when they told me my quarterly income tax payments or even advised me that I needed to pay my Self Employment Taxes. Now I owe the IRS $1,490.00 in taxes for the 2014 tax year. I went in to the H&R Block office and was told to just pay the taxes and forget about it, it was not their fault and they will do nothing about it.
I used H&R Block to do my simple returns and thought using their prepaid card would be expedient. One screen in the flow asked how much to put on the card, in hundreds. I put $200 and it also asked if I wanted to see other prepaid card offers, so I clicked 'yes.' Yesterday I received an email saying that I had $210 and to click on a link. Several attempts resulted in server errors and a note to close the browser. So, I tried to use the Emerald card, but it would only accept $27. After a very lengthy wait on a call to the number on the card, I got two marginally understandable people and only managed to find out that my card only had $27; the balance was now zero. What happened to the other $200? Did I accidentally buy something thinking that I was just signing up for consumer offers? Did I accidentally buy gift cards? Given other comments online, I am far from the only person who has stumbled into this situation. It would merit some investigation and a consumer alert. As for me, two hundred dollars of my Federal refund is missing.
We recently moved to Ketchikan, AK from Vancouver, WA and wanted to get our taxes done locally to support the local economy. A few years ago we started having our taxes done elsewhere as opposed to doing them myself as they just became a huge struggle every year with the increase of the number of rental homes we have. The cost was not cheap (an average of $400.00) between two different places, but worth it for the peace of mind. We seen to ad on TV for the 50% off previous cost at other institutions and decided to give H&R Block a chance. So we made an appointment, went in and dropped all of our tax information off and sat with the preparer while she entered a good part of the taxes. Why? That is why I hire someone else to do them. Our taxes were prepared for them also on spreadsheets, along with all the necessary forms. It's not like we dropped them off in a shoe box. The first thing we were told when we sat down was "I do not normally do rentals, but I will this time with my bosses help I can do it". That should have been our first clue to just leave. After a couple of delays we finally went in and watched them finish entering our taxes with information they had but needed still to get from us as she did not know what to do. The final bill for their services was close to 300% more than the previous 2 years with the same amount of work as before. I know this as I use to do my own taxes. When confronted about the 50% off advertisement he said he does not honor that as the customers he has complained and felt they deserved the discount also. So, this guy operates under the H&R name but does not honor their promises. ** is the guy's name and he also operates a few offices in Seattle, WA. Beware!
My husband & I went to H&R block. They tried to say all we'd get back is 300$, but they were charging us 400$ to file. My husband asked about being able to deduct gas expenses for all the driving he did. He's an independent contractor. They said no. My husband ended up filing with TurboTax and not only did he get over a grand back, but he was allowed to use those gas miles as a deduction. File your taxes at TurboTax, because they REALLY do get your billions back.
I had my taxes prepared at the Cox Creek H & R Block office in Florence, Alabama. They were not time consuming or very detailed, just a straight forward tax return. I had a $20 off coupon and still was charged $213.50. I was stunned that I was charged such a fee! I will never use H & R again. My extended family uses a local owned tax service and had many more deductions, etc in their preparation and were charged $75. I used H & R Block because two years ago I used them in Florida and was charged $40.00 so I felt that they would be no more than the other company. I feel taken advantage of. I had no problem with the person who did the preparation, she was pleasant.
I booked my appointment with them based on their ad of 1/2 price. When I went to have my taxes done yesterday I was told that ad had run out. Then on my taxes I had to pay $255.50 for them because my wife earned $1020 working for the learning center teaching dance. H&R considered this as a personal business. The person who did my taxes entered $1020 as income and checked three boxes. That is all. I owed no taxes. Simple 1040 form & was charged way too much. I talked to my old tax preparer and they would have done my taxes for $125. I will be returning to them next year.
While filling out info I realized that software was not handling the data correctly. No way to indicate that the Dividend was tax-exempt. A bond sale was calculated incorrectly. Then I was charged twice, once for "Premium" and then for the state add-on.
Three out of five years they have messed up on my taxes. I have been given back my filing fees. To me these are high to begin with but all of a sudden this year they are delaying my fees back to me. I have gotten no response but it takes up to 6 weeks to return the fees.. I have been waiting on someone to contact me that is in the manager area. And all I get when I talk to someone there are the operators for H&R Block and they have no clue what is going on and that I will receive a call. It has been 3 weeks since then.. and besides that the office that I got my taxes done - the manager there try to lie to me and I call her and various lies.
They did such a stupid error by sending the wrong address. I paid them $120 & I didn't even received my tax refund. I hope H&R Block gets sued.
I went to a Premium office to get my return done. Between me and my wife, the cost for the return was over $300. Not including what I still owe in taxes. It's absolutely insane pricing, none of which is stated beforehand. It feels totally arbitrary. 173 for the federal return, 62.50 for state, 11 for local, 30 for HSA deduction, another 23 for HSA distribution, 15.50 for 1099, etc. It's a total ripoff. And I'll NEVER use their services again. I'm going to make it a habit to tear them down every chance I get.
Me and my wife went to H&R Block this year not know that they just hire anyone off the street. We were told we could not write off the interest on our new house, our claim, our child... The lady had no idea what she was doing and was more concerned about her lunch order to her secretary.
I went to have my taxes done. It was a simple form but my tax person had printed my last year which I didn't need. I was told it would be 150.00 and when I was done it cost me more than I was told. 215.00. Don't let them print anything unless you want them.
I was shocked when my tax lady works at H & R block. She did my taxes for the last 19 years or so, told me my fee is $383.25. My income is 1/3rd since I start collecting my social security, and all this advertising H&R block all over the TV stations was false advertising or what exactly??? No idea why, she did not know why either.. I had to handed her my credit card to charge the amount the computer came up with it!!!!!! I called the 1 800 472 5625. A nice man said he does not know anything regard tax preparations!!!!!! He gave me a case no., and someone will call me in the next 5 days. "Ok", I said. What else we consumer suppose to do????? God help us all.
Had H&R Block do my taxes today for the first time after a bad experience with our local CPA which I had used the last few years. That private firm would charge me $325 for my own 1099 and my wife's W-2. It was / is a simple enough return with few write-offs or anything what could be considered difficult. The gentleman who prepared for me was nice enough and seem capable. I was shocked when the total for services rendered was $701!! Seriously.could this be right? He tried to convince me it is because they did so much when in reality he just copied my last year's copy from that CPA firm. I almost feel like contesting this....
I have unsuccessfully attempted to change my beneficiary on my Roth IRA 3 times. Each attempt has been followed by either an email or letter from H&R Block with the same blank change of beneficiary form. Phone calls to them have not provided any results. What can be done? I have been attempting this for over a year.
H&R Block charged me $514.75 to file my taxes. They claim that the more inputting they have to do and the more forms they have to file, the more the cost is. I don't know ANYONE that pays over $200.00 to file their taxes. They are out and out ripping people off!
After walking in H and R block, I stepped up and asked how much it would cost to complete my return. The lady said $9.99. She prepared the info on computer then handed me my copy. She looked in the computer and said she could save me $20.00 and printed a coupon. Then said my total was $163 and some change. I could have went to my usual tax preparer for $75.00. What a rip off! I'll never go back to you again. Thanks H and R. Furthermore I got a smaller return through you.
I have used H&R block to prepare my 2010-2013 taxes. I file a simple schedule C because I am self employed. They charge by the form which usually ends up costing between $350 and $400 each year. They take a very long time since they keep having to look on the computer to see the instructions for each form. I am usually there around 3 or more hours. I have since met a CPA with 50 years experience who offered to look at the taxes that H&R block prepared. So far I have gotten back nearly $1000 in amended taxes from mistakes that H&R block made. I am expected to get another $300 back when the rest of the years are amended. I would not recommend H&R block to anyone. They hire employees that are not trained to do even simple taxes. The woman who prepared my taxes was pleasant but told me that they pay her $8.00 an hour. Outrageous! Find a reputable CPA who will do them right.
I just did my taxes at H & R Block in Norristown, PA with **. She was very proud and dismissive. My tax was very simple, she hardly took one hour to do it. When I called her on the phone to ask some questions, she had no time to talk to me and sounded very irritated like she had other more important taxes to do and she could not wait to hang up. I left few messages for her but she never returned my calls. When I came in to sign the papers by appointment, I was told to wait for 20 minutes as she was finishing some other taxes. She scrolled down the pages on the computer very fast and talking at the same time as if I should know taxes as well as her to understand quickly. Worst part was her exorbitant charges! My tax line items were almost the same as last year yet she charged me $315 this year, up from $230 last year without any explanation. The problem with tax preparers is that once you hand in your W-2 and 1099, you are captive and cannot go to any other preparer. Do not go to H & R Block, THEY ARE DAYLIGHT ROBBERS!!!
I downloaded their Premium software onto my home computer and my tax returns have been e-filed by a thief, before I could e-file my own return. Of course they are getting a big refund! This had to happen through the initial download I made at the H&R Block website, or the updates you are required to do from their website. BEWARE, do not buy H&R Block software. Even if you buy an actual CD, you have to update online!
The last time I did my taxes with H&R Block I was charged under $30 for the service. This year it was $150. If my math is correct that's four time what I got charged last time I was there. They were very professional. Very polite. I think she left a couple questions out on purpose.
The "free" service that H & R Block advertises for online tax preparation is not free. I started my free tax preparation a couple of weeks ago and had to stop. Since then I've received about a dozen emails telling me to finish my taxes--not asking me, TELLING me! Today I received an email that shows a clock ticking down, saying my cost right now is $14.99 (not free) and that I "must file by March 20, 2015." It also says that when the clock reaches 0 my cost will be $34.99. This is an unfair and deceptive trade practice.
Made an appointment on-line with the intention of having business and personal taxes done. Got to the office and was told they couldn't do my business tax forms and that I would have to go to the "Premier" office. The only appointment available was on the Saturday before the taxes are due on Monday which meant I would have to file an extension since they would have to review the file before I could send it. I said okay to all that and the office I was at called the Premier office to make the appointment. The day before the appointment, I called them to see if I could get an idea of what it was going to cost. Not only could they not give me any idea of the cost, but they didn't have any record of the appointment, so I would have gone to the office at 9:00 on a Saturday morning just to find out they couldn't do it again and meanwhile, my taxes would be late!
H&R Block charging too much for tax return. I went twice to complete and finally they ask me to pay 395$ but my return is 900$. They not worthy and wasting of money. They asking me to take peace of mind, I ask "H&R block doesn't have confident in their tax preparation?"
Terrible. Absolutely horrific. Went over to discuss my tax return and this lady (**) immediately tried to make me feel unwelcome (no sure if my better looks has something to do with that :)). Although rude, I still wanted to hear from from a professional standpoint (I like to give people a second chance). Poor me, the experience got worse and worse. She implied that I was there to get her knowledge rather than discuss the return, and rudely wanted to know if I wanted her to do my taxes or not. Funny is that the front desk encouraged me to go over to discuss my return with the option of deciding for H&R to do it or not... I left in complete HORROR. Why H&R is allowing people like that to do business with client? NEVER MORE!
Tried filing my taxes on the H&R Block online app. I accidentally upgraded to Best of Both and paid, then requested tech support to downgrade it back to basic. Now the app is requesting that I pay again for both the product and to file the taxes with fed and state. I have proof of receipt that I can pull up right off the app. I called tech support again, and they said I didn't pay. I said I had a transaction ID and a order #. The rep told me they couldn't look up a transaction that way (Why the heck have an ID number if you can't look it up that way). They told me the only way I could get my money back was to mail them my BANK STATEMENT. Yeah, okay, you can't even find your own receipt for the payment that I can pull up off the app, I'm going to trust you guys with my bank statement. Don't use this product! If you make one mistake, they have no idea how to fix it on their end. $116.98 lost to these not so intelligent people.
I filed my taxes with H&R Block in 2012-2014, received a letter from the IRS in 2015 stating I owe for 2014 because I fell to report a portion of my income. I took my letter and 2014 tax return back to H&R block, they reviewed and say, yeah it's their fault but I did not sign up for the peace of mind guarantee so therefore I'm responsible???????
Brought our taxes to h&r Block and turned out great at first. We were going to be getting an 8000.00 return. We were so excited. All year my husband paid his quarterly taxes plus some with the hopes of not having to pay in so much at the end of year. So you can imagine our excitement. My husband decided to look the taxes over and discovered that h&r block made an error. Now we have to pay in 800.00! Such a huge error! We will never take our business there again!
Last yr. I filed made 5200.00 for the year - charged me 85 bucks total. This yr I filed made 7811.00 - charged me 228 bucks plus electronic bank deposit an additional 34.95 but did do that last yr. I've talked to people who made double to triple income and paid the same as me. I only got a 1,011.00 refund before they milked me. This is so wrong.
Normally I am very happy with H&R Block's online software and service, but apparently this is only the mechanical side of their customer service. This year my refund was rejected due to an Employer ID error on my employer's behalf. I was already charged the $14.99 to file my state tax. I now have to file by paper and cannot use the "free" online software. After calling (waiting on hold for 20 minutes) and speaking with an H&R Block representative, I explained the situation and after being put on hold several times was told that the "$14.99 charge was a preparation fee and that I had already used the software." I explained that their website said "for $14.99 it can ALSO file my state taxes", but the rep told me that I was wrong and it was for preparations. So a wasted $14.99 as well as 30 minutes of holding for 2 minutes of talk time to tell me, "Oh well our money now." I also told the H&R Block representative that I would be making an online review to which he replied "Go right ahead sir." I guess when you make millions on doing other people's business for them, it doesn't matter who that one little guy is. H&R Block...... the Wal-Mart of tax preparation.
The IRS sent my refund to the card set up by H&R block on the 3/4/15 and I yet to receive it. I can't get anybody on the phone at the IRS. The cardholder people are telling me I need a routing number and account number. So I went to the IRS building and they told me I have to have an appointment. So needless to say, I haven't gotten my refund yet.
For tax season 2012 & 2013 we filed our corporate & personal taxes with H&R Block. During the both the following years we were contacted by the I.R.S. for numerous reasons. Changes, Payments on tax bills, etc. When I tried to reach our preparer, there wasn't a return response. We had to figure out & communicate with the I.R.S. ourselves. Not pleasant. We thought we'd give H & R another try this year. I requested, 2 days before our appointment, a list from the preparer, on what we need to bring to our appointment. A message was sent thru the receptionist at the 1661 Hancock St. office. As of this morning, still no reply. I received numerous voice mails about confirming today's appointment. I confirmed, but need to change the time. When I called to do that, Some C.R. rep stated she needed my last 4 S.S. # to change the appointment time. I was very uncomfortable with that request from this stranger & asked for another form of I.D. I can provide. I was told that she can already see my last 4 ss# and my confirmation is the only acceptable i.d. When I still requested another form ** felt the need to show her frustration by pressing the hold button without informing me of such. After a few minutes, she came back to tell me she will talk to her supervisor & "hold on please" then I was told. After I spoke to her supervisor, it was apparent that the later "hold on" was because her supervisor was there. Because of these continued unacceptable service, this will be that last year for our personal & corporate taxes will be filed by H & R block. Your privacy statement did not apply to this & standing behind your clients AFTER filing certainly hasn't applied to this. Not sure if any action will be taking, such as, speaking to or better training for C.S. call center reps for peak season service. Your last 4 S.S. # only policy to change an appointment is unacceptable. I will be contacting BBB & writing a review on Yelp in regards to these on going problems.
Got my taxes filed with them, my state tax and federal tax. I received my federal but not the state for at least over a month. I decided to call into H&R Block and they have let me know that they weren't filed I would have to go see the specialist that filed the taxes. I went to H&R office...got with the person that filed it. He says they were filed and just to satisfy me, he will re-submit the state tax again. To my knowledge, once you submit once, you can't submit again. Once he submitted the state I got a confirmation the next day that my taxes were approved. Since I felt I didn't get what I was guaranteed like every year I file with I decided to speak to the manager on duty which I explained the situation. He responded that he was gonna look into it and will give me a call as soon as he get results of what happened. Yet I still haven't got an answer or a call back from the manager. Not thrilled at all of the service I received this year.
I've been filing with H&R Block for the last 13 yrs and every yr the fees goes up. Well, yesterday (3-9-15) I went to file my taxes and my tax accountant said that this year I can file electronically (my husband has an old debt that's not my debt, therefore, I file with an injured spouse) and she said I should check within 24 hours for the status. Which I did on 3-10-2015. My refund was not there or could not be found. I called and the tax advisor said that I had to pay for the injured spouse form $258. I could've downloaded the form for free from the IRS. Now I have to get $258 to get my refund! I've been a customer faithfully for 13 yrs. I've also referred several friends! Not good.
I took my handicapped brother to H&R Block for tax prep. He had gone there for several years. He receives a modest pension, disability income and he has a savings acct that accrues a small dividend. This year, the only thing different was a stock sale that earned him $27.00. Last year he paid $160. This year the fee was $302.00. I said there must be a mistake. The preparer told me since he made the $27.00 (I saw her type the number in the same screen as the dividend screen). It triggers a larger fee - almost double. We were with her 15 minutes. Then she tried to sell him a "piece of mind" contract for another $35.00 and a special number from the IRS to protect him from fraud. I hope this place is investigated.
I had my taxes done at the southern plaza on 2/4/15. They did not summit my taxes that day. I called to see what was going on with my taxes. I left a message for ** - You had done my taxes. She never called back that day. So I called again and left a message. She called back and she said she would look into it. She called back and told me I didn't pay for them that day. I told her I did and my girlfriend even went next door to get change cause they didn't have any. I gave her the numbers that were on the receipt. The within two hours I got a text saying the taxes would be here in a month. The next day I heard from the state. For what I went through and their wrong doing I feel I should get my taxes done for free. They screw up I did not.. so they should do something cause I had to wait longer for their mistakes.
The agent told me I will get some money from state and fed. I was counting on my refund. I went online to Where's My Refund, I couldn't get no answer. Next thing I know I get a mail from the irs telling me they're holding my refund because I owe state taxes. I went back to the office and one of the agent said he should have told me but he knew and made a mistake. I paid them 234.00 for they could do my taxes then they told me there's nothing they can do. It's not right. What can I do?
H&R Block made mistakes on my 2007 tax returns and wouldn't honor my peace of mind contract with them because they said 3 years had gone by. I was working on this with them for years. I cannot work because the IRS will take my money. I don't have enough money to sue them, and have tried all avenues possible, but will not give up. I have a strong case and all documents necessary...Just need legal help.
This could have been the worst experience ever! I was so disappointed, and this will be the last time I step into an H&R Block office. Oh, wait, that's not true, because I received a call 2 days after the horrible experience telling me that I need to go back and pick up an amendment to my state return (which was done 48 hours after our original appointment). Apparently, she screwed up. I was so mad when I received this follow up call, it changed everything. My biggest complaint is that this was missed during our original appointment (which took 90 minutes because she was so inept with the computer system). I paid $350 for someone to screw things up? I explain enough my frustration, the only thing I can suggest is to avoid H&R Block, too expensive, unprofessional... and they really should drug test their representatives.
They told my son that he couldn't claim me. I guess, the young man that took a crash course to work there this season assumed because he was young that couldn't be right. Now, we have to amend it ourselves and wait at least four months to get back the rest of our refund. We paid a fee for their service. They didn't refund it or offer to do the amendment.
I am reporting for a poor, mentally challenged individual. Went to H&R Block for help with a simple 1040EZ filing. He has no experience with a computer. He did not know he could go to the library for free help. H&R charged him a whopping $227.00! It could not have taken them more than 10 minutes. This is criminal. Wish we could get all these type cases together and file a class action suit.
I just went to H&R block and was floored to see that my fees totaled to $322.50. I was supposed to be getting a refund of $1400 and this is almost 25% of my refund. Last year as a student I did not make a lot and I got a education credit of $192 and from that H&R block charged $50. I moved to a new work place in December to start working in January and they charged me a fee from my moving cost/refund. Everything itemized deduction I claimed was added as a percentage fee into the final total. The base federal return was $150, base state was $48 and then rest in fees for each of my itemized deduction. I walked out of the office immediately as I saw the fee (I feel bad for the lady who tried to help me... it's not her fault). Please stop the advertisements that claim you will get us the best possible refund... because all you do is to get 25% of the deserved refund of the poor hardworking into your pockets. This is not worth it!!! This is the last time I will walk into a H&R block office...
I had my taxes done by a lady in the office, She in herself was a nice person but that does not make mistakes vanish or appear. I had ran my own taxes online so I had a pretty good idea of what the outcome should be. I only go to a professional to have backup in case there is an issue. When she said she was finished I noticed that her figures and mine were off. I question this, she finally looked through what she entered and I pointed out to her that she failed to report federal tax withheld on one of my 1099's. She adds it in and it makes an 800.00 difference in my refund (not small change) confident she then had it all correct she sent it off electronically. When I got home I looked line by line at the return and what do I see? She only entered 1/2 of my property tax paid in. That was another 860.00 deduction and 280.00 increase in my refund. Now I can't get a hold of anyone to find out if they are going to have to file an amended return and add even more time to receive my refund or what. I also purchased the peace of mind deal. I have NO PEACE OF MIND at this moment. I also feel since I have had to do 1/3 of my own return I should not be charged the full amount for them to prepare them. They say they GUARANTEE 100% accurate returns and GUARANTEE to get you back the most they can yet this preparer was going to cost me over 1000.00 dollars from item she missed all together or put in the amount wrong. Where is my GUARANTEE and what do I get when they fail to hold up their end?
I called H&R Block to get a price quote for filing my taxes. I told them all of the forms that I had. They quoted me between $185.-$250. I got there, started my taxes and then had to correct the preparer on my property tax form; we bought a house last year and only had paid the partial year of property taxes. He entered in the amount that the seller paid instead of the amount that we paid for the year. That was the main reason that we wanted to get our taxes done by a tax professional. We wanted to make sure that they were done correctly. If I wasn't watching what the guy was doing they would have definitely been wrong. When he was done all of the sudden the quote he gave me somehow with no extra forms then what I had stated before jumped to $309. It has been 29 days since I filed my taxes and I have not yet received my refund and the IRS Where's my Refund tool only tells me that my taxes are still being processed. I can't get a hold of a live person at the IRS and H&R Block has done nothing to try to help me figure out what is going on with my taxes. The only thing that they can reassure me of is that if I am getting audited that they will back me up then. Until then I am hearing how all these people are filing their taxes and getting their refunds in their accounts in as little as 7 days. And I can't find out what is going on with mine. I am trying to get up enough gusto to go in and demand my money back. I would never recommend going to H&R Block to anyone that I know not even my enemies!
Paid over 300 dollars for H&R Block to file our taxes and our Illinois return was supposed to be back in 2 to 3 weeks and it's been over 2 months and we still don't have them back.
It calculated my tax return wrong, support can't help. Now I have to do an amendment by hand. Use TurboTax instead.
I had my taxes done by H&R Block on 02/03/2015. They didn't enter the correct information for my children and they entered my school information wrong. This was a $4,369.00 mistake. I called and they had to an amendment now I have to wait 12 weeks to receive the rest of my tax money. That is not the worse. They charged me $302 to mess up my taxes and I am still trying to get them to put the money back into my account that they took out for fees. I will never use H&R Block again. This is the worse experience I have ever had and would not recommend using them. I would just like to be reimbursed for the filing fees since they say they have a 100% guarantee they should honor this.
First off I'm a long time customer of your company. For the second year in a row my tax return was sent to the wrong address. The first time they solved the issue in a timely manner. This year the same mistake happened again, this time I was told to wait 90 days for a new check. I feel it is not fair the working man has to suffer for the same mistake again, but this time I was not dealt with the same manner as last year. All my documents had the correct address on them, they messed up and I need somebody to fix this issue in a timely manner. I am losing interest from my money and that is wrong.
OK, so my first year filing my Taxes as a Homeowner. My income was only $18,000, but I wasn't sure what forms to use, so, I decided to let H & R Block do them. I was NOT given any type of price range when I began, nor did I ever get a price range; that is until it was filed. The form used was a 1040, but not the "EZ" form as in prior years. At the end, what was the charged? $172.50! AND, if That wasn't bad enough? In order to have the charge taken from my refund, as it always had been; that would have been an additional $35-$50 in addition!! Oh, and this did NOT even include State and Local returns!!! Had I known this was would be charged SO much, I'd have either gone elsewhere or tried to do it myself! I did file a Complaint, about 3 weeks ago. I was told I would receive a phone call within 72 hours. Still NO call, no email... I just called again, the person I spoke to said I would receive another call, within the next 72 hours, again!
Today it was my 1st and my last time that I use H&R Block. The lady that attended me, she was nice and friendly but she doesn't look like professional tax preparer. She did not seems like knows what she was doing. Their fee - it is ridiculous $233 including a coupon on $20 off for being my 1st time with them. Last year I paid $70 for the same work, definitely I don't recommend use H&R Block.
Normally filed with Turbo Tax, but due to a rough year decide to go with someone to work on my taxes. I sit down with the tax preparer and ask about the 50% offer if I filed with someone before, and told him I had file with Turbo Tax. He said no worries at the end that all will come out your good. We go over the taxes and when we are at the end the bill said $475, then the preparer tries 4 times to apply the 50% off offer and he selects Turbo Tax from the drop menu but the software gives him an error. He keeps trying and then tells me that needs to go and talk to manager. Well manager comes back and said, "No it does not apply if you file taxes with Turbo Tax, you needed to read the fine print." I told him, "But I ask the guy at the beginning and he told me I was ok," and he said no. Then he goes on and told me, "That just happened with another lady." I look and it was my fiance also over $425 dollars. I ask him both: "How many people had walkout from you guys because of this or create a problem because of this?" They both ignore the question. Manager left. Will never file this again.
I had the same agent do our taxes for over 10 years. We were very happy with her. Then last year, 2 years after my husband died, the agent told me that I could still claim head of household AND claim my 24 year old son as a dependent, even though I was past the deadline for filing as a widow and my son was too old according to what I had read. I didn't think that was right and said so. I even asked her to double check. She insisted she was correct - so we went ahead and filed that way - head of household and claimed my son as a dependent. A year later - I was audited. I had Peace of Mind coverage, so the correction, fees and penalties were all taken care of by H&R Block. BUT - they sent me a check for more than what the IRS said was due. When I pointed this out, I was told - they figured it wrong - just send it and they will correct it. Well, that didn't happen. I ended up with a refund. By this time, it was well past tax season. I couldn't get anyone to call me back from H&R Block. My preparer's email was disabled. No one answered the phone at her office. It was a nightmare. I ended up spending hours on the phone with the IRS. They kept telling me - "Its alright - keep the money. H&R Block made a mistake." Fast forward nearly another year! I get a letter from the IRS in the mail - demanding more money, penalties and interest. Why? You guessed it - from the refund. It took the IRS another YEAR to refigure the SECOND ERROR that H&R Block made. Now I'm really panicked. I still can't get anyone on the phone. There is no "home office" to contact. No "supervisor". I finally get someone on the phone. It takes weeks. Finally she actually goes and talks to an agent and "gets it worked out." I filed yet another payment letter and payment. The check that H&R Block sent was $400 short of the penalty and interest owed. Luckily I put that refund in my savings account and held onto it because I knew something wasn't right. So I got screwed out of that money as well. NOW HERE IS THE really bad part. I had a CPA do my taxes this year - DUH! I told him what had happened and he said he was surprised that H&R Block didn't fight harder for me. He said that they were half right - I could file as head of household still with my son living with me. The error was in telling me I could claim him. The CPA said that if they had talked live with the IRS it most likely could have gotten fixed with just paying the tax due from claiming my son. He said no way should it have cost over $5,000! Oh - and H&R Block send me a 1099 for the money they paid - and THAT cost me more in taxes this year. So - in sum - they got me audited. Disappeared when their ad says that they are always there for you. And THEN they messed up representing me when I did get audited. DO NOT TRUST THESE PEOPLE! They lie lie lie.
After a week of spending 1+ hr a day on the phone with their support, they finally said they would have technical support contact me. 3 days later no call, no way to contact again, except by waiting on the phone for another hour +. AZ tax software has a closed verification loop that will not let you override or prepare the return for e-file or printing. It is on AZ 140 Schedule A line 14 mini worksheet line b. If you use this to claim sales taxes there is no way to complete the return. Their customer service is just plain lousy and wait times are totally unreasonable for the price you pay.
Congratulations...You've worn me out after more than an hours wait for a CHAT. Product Review: Worst Tax Program ever. Help menus stink, the search capability is non-existent. Searching for a form (i.e. 8865) or topic (entering K1) is worthless. And you've taken over the #1 spot for Worst Customer Service from Verizon...and that was hard to do. You won't see another dollar of my hard-earned money. I have entered my tax information to include entering two (2) K1 records (one for each partner) with all of the required info. During Review, I am getting the following error: Sch K1 (8865), Error: Partner #1 must be the filer of Form 8865. The error link takes me to K1 Allocation Detail Schedule but I see nowhere to identify Partner #1. Additionally, the information that I filled in on this sheet should have been linked from the (2) K1 forms that I completed. This software stinks...
After hearing on TV about the half price charge of your previous tax preparation, I went into the local H&R Block office with my receipt from my last tax preparation as was instructed by their representative by phone. When I handed the lady at the front desk my tax info. and the receipt, she told me there would be a minimum $75 charge. I told her that nowhere in any of their advertisements is there any "minimum charge" mentioned - false advertisement! That is illegal here in America! I took my business elsewhere. Scam!
I tried to activate the program with the supplied code about 18 times during a two-week period and each time, I received an absurd error message telling me my computer date was wrong (it certainly wasn't). The message simply told me to try again later but to no avail. Because the program could not be activated, I was denied electronic filing of my federal return and couldn't download the state program, which were major inconveniences. The customer service numbers were perpetually busy and I couldn't even report the problem. That's the last time I buy the H&R Block tax program.
Wife and I had an appointment on Friday, February 27, 2015 at Town Square Plaza, 1106 Town Square Rd, Pottstown, PA 19465. I originally made an appointment to drop off my papers. The agent, named **, had questions. After answering all the questions at least two times and sometimes three times and his numerous errors on the computer, he had us sign various different forms. I told him I only wanted to file my Federal Taxes and I would do the rest due to my unfamiliarity with ObamaCare. After repeatedly answering his questions in regard to the local tax and that I would file he finally dropped asking me. Before I knew it, he showed me what my tax return would look like. I was surprised that he was done so I said okay. He got up and went to the printer and came back with my forms. I asked about the forms I needed to mail and he said it was already filed electronically. I was pissed because I did not want to e-file. He sat down and I asked him how much and he said $110. I could have went to Jackson Hewitt for $75. The only form he filed was a 1040EZ and I didn't earn enough to worry about ObamaCare penalties. He also filed the PA 40. I feel I was ripped off and that he was actually filing while he was asking questions. He had us sign numerous forms saying that the first ones didn't take which I believe at this point I more than likely signed several things. After he told me the price, he then attempted to sell me on some kind of protection plan in the case I was audited, my response was, "With only a W2 on a 1040 EZ? Do I look stupid?" He then proceeded to have my refund on a card or some such nonsense and I said that I wanted my check mailed to me from the US Government and I would pay for the services. This firm has no published rates that I could find on the Internet. When asked, they say, "We have to see the amount of work you have to file," and then they file before you can even ask how much and say that it is already filed. I will never go there again and I would not recommend them to anyone. They do misdirection, which you do not expect and don't realize it until too late. To charge extravagant prices after the work is done is a form of fraud, in my opinion. Go to Jackson Hewitt, at least they give upfront costs and the only reason I went to Block was because of a friend's recommendation. I know......Caveat emptor.
I have used H and R Block in the Nanuet New York office. l have a problem, again because the Voucher they had given me to pay my Federal was addressed to the wrong State. This year the same problem occurred now my federal payment is going to a different state and will probably be returned to me again to be resent when I told them of this. They said not to worry about it. They charged me $211 for a simple single tax return. They did not offer to help or give me another voucher with the correct address. They blamed it on their new computer system and did not accept blame themselves since I have a different mailing address from my physical address. The Federal returns for the year before were sent to where the state is of my mailing address, not the physical address... This cause a delay of one month after the deadline. This year is a recurrence of the same and in progress. I am hoping it gets redirected to the correct Federal office for NY residences. Another issue... I had taken money out at 59 1/2 years old out of my 401k plan and the person named Sandy ** doing my tax return started to charge me the penalty not asking me if I took the money out before or after and I had showed her I had taken it out after the required age limit. She then had issues with correcting The New York State and the New Jersey state as well as the Federal denominations to reflect no penalty. They are stupid they are incompetent and they should not be able to take money to do someone's taxes!
I purchased this software from Staples. When I attempted to install on my computer, only the personal software installed. I had to spend over an hour on the phone with their tech support to download the Business software. This software is supposed to import the previous year's information into the 2015 returns. I was on hold for over an hour before any one pick up the call. This person decided that she could not help me and transferred the call. I am still on hold and it has been over an hour. I have had challenges like this every year that I have used the business tax software. This may be the longest that I have been on hold.
There is no truth in the ad of 50% off what tax preparation was last year! I will be calling BBB and Attorney General. I'll also let everyone know!
This software will not import TurboTax. I have waited three hours trying to get assistance by chat, phone and email. I now have to go and buy TurboTax. The support group is non existent, tried 5 numbers, try call CEO, phone line disconnected. This is one major headache. Throwing it away so no one else will have this problem.
My appointment was at 1:00. The person I was schedule with was still working with another customer. After about 45 minutes of still waiting I notice there is 3 other employees just sitting around! Ten minutes later a woman walks in and says she doesn't have an appointment, the employee says, "It's okay. We'll take you now." What! I've was sitting here for 40 minutes and the employee took her before me. I was furious. So basically if I wouldn't have made an appointment I would have been better off.
H&R charged my husband and I $500 to file our taxes. We've used them for about 1st ears mind you before I get started. Our returns have always been very simple, this was the second year with a direct sales business and our home. First the person filing our taxes didn't know that you had to pay the preparation fees upfront this year or if you were getting a large amount back it HAD to go on the emerald card. That annoyed me but I paid the fees and went about my business. 21 days and still no refund. I called the IRS and they said the account number had been entered incorrectly. I called H&R only to find out the person who entered my taxes was the manager of the location and offered NO HELP! A manager from another store seemed helpful but never got the problem solved. The general manager NEVER returned any of my phone calls. I cannot believe I paid this company to do this! I will never be using this company again.
H & R Block has had many complaints as far as their efiling returns go on their website. I have gotten an error message three times stating....."IRS records show the taxpayer's Social Security number (SSN) on this return is the same as the spouse's SSN on another return already filed this year. Double-check your taxpayer SSN. Fix any issues and e-file again. Otherwise, you'll have to file a paper return." Please look into this. I am so frustrated and annoyed. Thank you.
I have gone to my accountant since I was seventeen years old and saw your advertisement 50% off. Also brought coupon with the 50% which was sent to my home with me. When I presented coupon accountant stated I needed a receipt from previous year. I was told it was stated in very small print. I was very displeased. I feel false advertisement. Fee was high. Accountant was very helpful no fault with him, felt fault with your company. Please respond. By the way I'm 58 now. It was a tough decision to change. Thank you. Response appreciated.
The H & R Block on 43rd and Thomas here in PHX AZ, helped my bf receive more money. He originally filed with Tax Liberty, a simple W2 form and they charged him 280$... Went into H & R Block a few days later and were told he could amend. And his return went from 470$ to 4,646$. Sticking with them from here on out.
Do we have to even rate 1? More like 0! I will never prepare my taxes at H&R Block again! Well it's actually my fault to keep going! Every year they charge me a different amount! $423 this year plus bank fee of $34.95! Last year I called and spoke to the person that prepared my taxes and told her this year I would do it on TurboTax.com since I tried doing my federal and it matched theirs perfectly, and that I would do the state one with her because it's hard to understand it being that I work in a different state! But no, I ended up going anyway! I think it's because you're so depended on them that you're afraid to go elsewhere!
I just have never gotten service from H&R Block like this. I filed taxes Jan 19th and four days later lady calls and says she put in wrong social security number. So she puts in the right one goes over all my info again and says she's sending it back to IRS in two weeks. Later I call to ask what was that date she called me and sent taxes back in to IRS. She calls me back and just tells me the date that I should get taxes back on or before. I called she just basically kept giving me the runaround and just blaming IRS saying they fired people and they are slow but see she wasn't answering my questions. So the last day came and no money so I called. She didn't even look it up. Just blamed IRS and gives me another date and so today my friends is the twenty fifth NO REFUND! So I called the H&R Block lady one more time and she straight says "I will call you right back." OK she never called back!! See that's ALL I wanted was to see what's going on, just as much info as the H&R Block can get that's all. And so I have no clue what to do. If anyone happens to know anything I can do, please let me know. Thank you.
Just had taxes done for 2014, when I asked how much they stated it varies. They ended up charging $358.50! We could have gotten an accountant to do this for that price. I will be going back to Jackson Hewitt next year! This was a horrible experience.
We filed taxes with H&R Block first time, and I will never go there again, because first of all they charged $340 for service which I think is ridiculous. Second thing I was waiting for my refund way longer than any other year. I will never go there again.
This software does not include form 4136 so anyone needing it cannot e-file using this software because it has to be printed and mailed in. I did not notice this until most of the way through entering my information. H&R Block simply said maybe they would include it next year.
I for one will never use H&R Block again for any tax issues I may have! Many others should go with any other company! We filed with them for the last 4 years always paying no less than over $400 each time for filing fees! They filed our tax form wrong the last two years for first time home buyer's credit! My husband is active duty military we had to pcs away from our home state due to military orders and had to move out. On our tax form it should have been filed with the military clause so we could've been exempt from paying it all back or the IRS taking the lump sum. Well our taxes were adjusted and now we are out $6,000. That was fine - I seen the mistake and knew we needed to go in and amend them, well H&R Block continues to argue I'm in the wrong and we don't qualify! I spoke directly to an IRS tax specialist she said yes we meet every criteria. They still refuse to make it right! Not only that but they are very rude with me when they are stating their side and refuse to hear anything I'm saying the tax "precessional" cut me off every time I would talk. They belittle you even though I've talked directly to IRS. I'm pretty certain the IRS knows how tax law goes. My complaint they messed up our taxes they refuse to rectify it and amend them and I'm out $6,000 plus filing fees they don't deserve! Very disappointed in how they conduct business! Thankfully the on base tax service said they would amend them for us! I hope in the future they will talk directly to the IRS instead of going on their own interpretation of the law and cost others like us lots of money.
I went in to file 2 1099 forms and paid a total of $508 for 1.75 hr. This is a ridiculous amount. I will not recommend this place to absolutely anyone, they are professionals in ripping people off! I have never paid this much! Previous yrs. I paid $70-$160. Too bad I didn’t schedule an appointment sooner with the previous companies so I had no choice but to look elsewhere close to me in my area. I had asked H&R how much it would cost, their answer was "it varies, other companies charge a total amount of $180 per hr." So I know how long it takes to get my taxes done but they took way too long 1 hr. and 40 min. And they charged me $508???? That's more than their competition, if I round it up to the whole hr. and say I was there for a total of 2hr. It would have been $254 per hr. x 2 =$508. I’m very organized with all my records, files, receipts, etc. I don't think this person knew how quick this would have taken if he hadn't talk too much yet I had to pay to hear him talk how expensive other companies are. I told them that's more than their competition and they told me they charge but from not per hr. Which is more money... good thing about H&R Block, they LOST a client and their competition gained a New Client! DON’T THROW YOUR MONEY AWAY!
I went to H & R Block because I needed help with IRA distribution, social security and pension benefits. Also the tuition assistance form 8863. The clerk proceeded to copy the schedules I had completed and said "we can file your taxes for you." I asked how much and she said "we must finish first." Upon completion she told me it was $452.00. I thought it was a joke. She itemized each schedule which added up to $452. After stating that was excessive for copying my forms, she gave me a $20 voucher. I paid on credit card $432.00. I will never go to H & R Block again. It is a RIP OFF.
This is my first and last time doing business with these "people". I called the H&R Block on 87th and Ashland (Chicago, IL) and was greeted by a receptionist that had me on hold for about 5 minutes before I got in touch by a lady with the last name of **. She had an attitude from the jump. "Can I help you" is what she said in an aggressive way. I then proceeded to ask my question. Her response was "We don't know, maybe you should try Google". I then said, "I thought you would know since you are a 'tax professional'". And her response was "Well, I guess we're not" and hung up. I would not recommended this place to anyone at all. You should find other options.
Went to the Farragut Square H&R Block in D.C. and received horrible service. Taxes for my wife and I were supposed to be competed the night of our appointment. While there, our tax person, Laura (very rude), told us she would rather finish them the following day. Instead of fighting her, my wife and I agreed and decided we could come back later in the week to finalize. As it stands today, it's been three full weeks and our taxes are only JUST finished. We have repeatedly called and e-mailed with very little response. To put the icing on the cake, we were told the total cost for the preparation was $435. We are finishing everything tonight and plan to fight this total cost. If I treated a client like this at my job, I would be fired or punished. I refuse to deal with this service and will absolutely fight them on the total cost. AVOID H&R BLOCK!
I am actually submitting this complaint for my neighbor, she has been doing her taxes with H & R Block for a few years. Well this year, she did as always, paid their outrageous fee to be told there was a problem, her taxes were not being accepted. She always has them put on her Emerald debit MasterCard, because it’s quicker and more convenient. Well she went into the office and finally the agent got them to go through. She waited about 2 weeks and checked her card, no money so she called and went to the office to see what the problem was, to be told that there was a problem with the routing number for the automatic deposit. Instead of it being for her Emerald MasterCard it was put on an American express card purchased at Wal-Mart. The owner of H & R block told her that she would have to call the IRS and American express herself and straighten out the problem. Well she was very upset and angry that the error was being pushed back on her after paying their crazy rapid refund preparation fee. So she began calling and nobody at American Express or H & R Block was willing to take the responsibility for the error. So she went in and told the owner that something needed to be done, because she paid for the Rapid refund. So the owner of H & R Block cut her a check for $2000, still not wanting to take responsibility for the error. According to my neighbor. She has spoke to several people at American Express and they said it could take several weeks to do an investigation and if possible get her the money back. She has been informed that, the card had been tracked down but no money, and that the reason she had so many problems with the taxes being accepted was that her taxes had been done online at a residence and submitted already, she asked how that could have happened when H & R Block was the only one that had her tax information. Not only has her taxes not been received, but because of this error her Paycheck which is also direct deposited to the Emerald MasterCard, has also been rerouted to this American Express and the owner of H & R block still is not willing to accept the responsibility for this huge financial burden and hardship this has caused. The owner has not been able to give any kind of solution to the problem, her only answer is that only the people that have access to the files are her employees. I don’t have her contact information, but we feel that she should talk to an attorney.
I am self-employed and have generally paid around $250 for my tax prep with other CPAs. I went to H&R Block this year and it came to $571!!!! And my accountant didn't seem like she knew what she was doing. She actually tried to put the phone number off one of my 1099s in as my SSN. They're not even the same number of digits and no one writes a SSN with parentheses around the first three digits! It was only after I said "That's not my SSN" and she pointed to it and asked, and I said "That's the phone number" that she realized. And it really just seemed like I was having to be hyper-vigilant and keep an eye on everything that was happening. And then the $571 bill. I mean come on. Never again.
Went to file my simple "FREE Federal Tax Refund" for this year and when I finished said it would charge me $21.00. Not that its a lot to pay but was expecting it to be free as advertised. Guess I won't be using them next year! :(
FILED, 1/21/15 Accepted 1/23/15 its 2/22/15. STILL NO RETURN!!!!! I got my statement & of course the $550 I paid was outrageous. The person who was doing my taxes didn't understand the system and was making errors, I had to tell her to correct. I am not happy with H and R Block. This services costs too much to not be kept in the loop. I've called the main headquarters... no answer. I've called irs, they say its under review. Smh...
I purchased the H&R Block "Deluxe" Federal & State software for $34.97 on Jan 4th. When I try to use it on Feb 21st, I am not able to download the Federal Updates. I called the H&R Block support phone number and wait for over 45 minutes to be connected to Maria, who is very nice, but has to "escalate" me to someone else for actual support. I am told to expect a call in 1 to 3 days. I am on an iMac Yosemite 10.10.2 and in a Mac Users Computer club. I do know the basics and then some. I have tried multiple ways to download the Fed updates... but all I get is "gathering information". I used the recommended H&R website tips, used disk utilities, re-started computer. Tried with update inserted in Applications. Nothing worked. I did get the PO Box to send back for refund with a case #. After 6 loyal years of using H&R Block, they are on the cutting block for future use as far as I am concerned. DO NOT BUY is my recommendation!
I filed my taxes at the end of January. The return came a short time later. I was looking over emails today and there was one from H&R Block, basically stating that we should be taking care to avoid tax fraud by hacking scammers, and by paying 29.95/year, we could be protected. Hmmmmm... I was under the impression that when we filed taxes using H&R Block, that we were and or would be protected. The problem with TurboTax being hacked was forgive me if I'm wrong, poor security safe guards in place to keep from being hacked. So if that is the case, why would a company ask for an additional fee to safeguard my tax filing????? It is really sad and it really ticks me off when a company will exploit a bad situation such as ie. TurboTax, to prey on innocent people's fear and charge them money for so called peace of mind. Which with the high fees they already charge, we as the public should already be safe guarded using H&R Block services and or products. I find this to be in very poor taste and severely poor integrity. I will be either looking to another tax prep. Or doing the taxes on my own next year. Totally Disgusted!!!!!!!
It's very simple. Years I have been getting ripped off from H&R Block. It wasn't until this year I found out more about taxes. I was able to deducted things I could have done for years, but H&R just wanted you to get in and out. Years, I have been getting ripped off. You're better off doing them yourself. Forget H&R block, unless you want to get ** out of your own money. Not once did they ever ask about my schooling, or medical, or house taxes, nothing.
H&R Block offers a free second look. All you have to do is bring in your last year's return with supporting documents if you need to and they'll see if you got all the money back you deserved. If they think you did, then there is no cost to you whatsoever. If they see you didn't get as much as you deserved, they'll amend it and of course you'll have to pay a fee for that but it's better than not having that money at all!
I have been doing my own taxes online for several years and decided to go in person to make sure that I have been doing a good job. For the simple tax filing: one job, single, no dependents, no mortgages/loans I got charged $321 instead of $29.99 online! My fault is that I haven't asked but I believe that that is something that should be brought upfront.
Here is the letter I'm trying to get to H&R block but of course I can't find an email address for customer service anywhere! I wanted to file a complaint on my local H&R Block store. Normally I go through a CPA to file my taxes but decided to get it done a little earlier this year and use H&R Block. Boy was I disappointed. My first disappointment was minor. I took the time to pick out the tax specialist that I wanted to help me when booking my appointment. When I got there I was taken to a completely different other person, with no explanation as to why. Why make picking a person even an option if you have no intention of upholding the customer’s choice? My second disappointment was major. I purchased a house in October 2014 and I took the paperwork that I would need in order to get the tax breaks I deserved. He looks at my paper, instantly put them aside, and then told me it wouldn't help me at all. He then proceeded to not enter ONE bit of information about my house purchase, the mortgage interest I paid, or most importantly my MCC program info. At the end of it all I was told I owed $312. I then explained to him how I really thought I'd be getting at least a little tax break from the interest on the house but he then made me feel stupid, brought in another employee (the one I initially wanted to do my taxes) just to further prove his point, and tell me that the mortgage company lied to me. He and the second employee insisted that my MCC form was only for the mortgage company to prove I had the funds to purchase the house. I was shocked and once I got to my car broke down in tears over how rude they were to me and the thought that my mortgage company potentially lied to me. I then proceeded to go home and do Turbo Tax to see what I got. And what do you know the MCC program gave me a $279 tax break, even though my interest paid in 2014 was minor it covered almost all the money I owed! I now only owe $36. I knew your guys didn't know what they were doing as soon as he looked at my housing papers and put them aside and never touched them again. I would educate your personnel. If I knew about the MCC program then surely tax professionals should too.
Filed our joint tax return in 2011 and that oct. Was to have our refund deposited into our acct. It is now 2015, I have worked endless hours and had to order my own transcripts from the IRS just to prove a point... That H&R block not only charged us almost double every year that we were return customers. The IRS admitted to all of our money actually going to H&R block. H&R block admits to keeping all the money, however, now that it is 3.5 years later and my husband and I are going through a divorce they say they cannot deposit our refund. Hiring an attorney & letting the press get a hold of this one. Sad thing too, my husband has spoken with the main lady held responsible for holding up our deposit even after she admitted on paper that we were due the refund, that he gave his full permission for me to handle all tax related issues as we are still legally married and I am the owner of our business, and lastly, chuckling, he runs the field not the office. Exposing H&R block for holding onto a measly $733.90 and making money off of other people's money.
It's hard to sound fair when you know a homeless person with one child went to H&R Block for a tax preparer and with little knowledge of other ways...and H&R would cost her $285.00 out of her $817.00 refund. And no she did not get rapid refund. This money was to be used for her and son and a place to live. How could you H&R take advantage of the unknowing.... one W-2 and one dependent which entered on 1040A is not a difficult return. Shame!
My husband and I went to H&R block like we have for years to file our taxes. We had only one W2 form from his employer and a form from as HSA account and that is all we had to file. We have NO dependent and NO other deductions so it's pretty simple and took our tax preparer about 15 to 30 minutes to complete our return. All she done is click a computer keys, clicked on something to bring up for our HSA account and filled in a couple of blocks, told us what we were getting back and then hit us with a $268.00 bill for clicking a few computer keys and the computer calculating things for her. My jaw dropped and I asked why so high... she replied, "Well I had to do another form for your HSA and that was $75.00." Well needless to say, I think H&R Block is getting a little too expensive for the common working folk and yet they keep raising their price every year. They do offer a peace of mind that if you get audited they will go with you and represent you, but it is an additional $150.00 to have that. I almost have to laugh at the commercial where H&R Block says bring your taxes to us and we will charge half of what your other preparer did last year, I feel that is a very misleading commercial and it is also misleading that they say that "We will prepare your taxes starting at $45.00." I can guarantee before you walk out you owe way more than $45.00.
My husband and I decided to go to H&R Block once again this year. I was a little intimidated by all the Health care info so we had them done by them. We were charged 370.00 for tax prep and 34.00 for the emerald card. I was a little taken aback by the charges so I reviewed the price we were charged...the last 6 years...we have gone at a reasonable $140-190 price. I called to ask why there was an almost $200 difference in tax prep charges and she explained I had one extra form filed for the health care. WHAT??? I'm sorry but that form cost 200 bucks to file. BS...I will do ours next year. Never again will I go to H&R BLOCK. Their motto is "rip you off by millions." I will never refer anyone either as the people I referred were ripped off just as much. Shame on you H&R BLOCK!! $$$
You people are a piece of work! You advertise you will lower fees to anyone coming to you as new customer yet all of us who have been loyal for years are getting screwed! You doubled what we payed last year! No fear that we will be back. Next year we will find a new tax company!
I have been doing my taxes myself using TurboTax for several years. Though I know what I am doing, I was audited last year, so this year I decided it best to go to H&R Block to have their support in case of an audit. I looked online to see that no fees were listed, so I made my appointment and met with Therese in Carmel, NY. I waited 20 minutes while she finished with someone else. No big deal. I sat with her and handed her my documents: two W2s and a 1099-MISC from being partially self-employed. She did not tell me anything about fees but I figured it would be reasonable, since it was a fairly simple return, with no house or anything else. Along with those forms, I was filing as Head of Household, with EITC and one dependent child. After an hour of filling in information (WITH MY ASSISTANCE. She didn't know what some of the questions meant, due to a "new system"), she told me it would cost over $400 and asked if she could submit it. I asked her a few times if I had a choice to opt out of using them (since I wasn't sure if I could do that and had been with her for over an hour at this point), and she said NO and that everything is already done. She then asked how I'd pay for it and I told her I didn't have the money on me, so she charged me an additional fee to take it out of my refund. She continued to tell me I had to pay 35 dollars to e-file my federal return and 13 dollars for my state return. GRAND TOTAL: $492.45 As soon as I got home, I called customer service. They helped me file a formal complaint. I am waiting on their reply. It better be good news. Never using H&R Block again. EVER. Oh, I'll add two things: 1. We were interrupted twice regarding her next two appointments, which was very distracting and made her forget to put the numbers in from my 1099 form. 2. She told me that next year when my divorce is finalized, I have to remember to claim child support as income. I did my research and child support is not taxable.
Had appointment at 5 pm today, Thursday Feb 19th. Still waiting at 532 pm. Said it would be another 15 min. to half an hr. Last time I use h&r block.
I bought 2014 IRS Deluxe plus Michigan State software from H&R Block for the first time this year. Michigan form 4884 provides older seniors the ability to exclude certain pension payments. The H&R Block software did not contain the form, so I tried to call H&R to find out why the form was missing, but after a LONG wait on hold, I thought that the deduction had been rescinded for 2014. I paid H&R Block an additional $21.15 so I could e-file my Michigan return. I wrote a check for the tax due and sent that out to the State USPS. The following day, I found out that the MI 4884 form was still in effect but H&R had not included it in their offering to customers. What a way to treat customers. They apologized, but absolutely would not refund the $21.15 I paid them to e-file an incorrect Michigan return that they had caused to be in error. It appears after a call I made today that that Form 4884 is still excluded from the software they send to their customers. I have a written "guarantee of 100% accuracy, and the maximum refund you're due" from H & R Block. I wonder how many attorneys it will take to get satisfaction from them. We'll see, I'm still miffed and VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH H&R BLOCK.
I had a simple W-2 needing to be filed. I started a time clock as soon as we started and they spend half of that time going over nonsense things that does not even matter to the individual filing the taxes and we were finished in 20 min. My charges for H&R Block was $175.00 too much. $175.00 divided by 20 equals $8.75 a minute. Will I be going back to H&R Block? No!! They have officially lost my business and I'm sure there is someone out there that offers the same service much cheaper.
I filed my taxes this year with H&R. Last year, I didn't file with them, however, for some reason thinking I'd get a much better filing fee because of the whole 50% advertisement I've been seeing. Apparently, I was wrong. What ended up happening was the person filing our taxes didn't know exactly what she was doing and blaming her mistakes on her computer. About an hour later, after all was said and done, she charges us 495.00 giving us a discount down to 430.00. About this time my morale fell, I glanced at her name tape and below the name stated manager. All I thought was,"Wow and she is a manager. I guess this is what it's like to be robbed in plain sight." Now, in 2012 I filed with H&R paid only 250.00 and at the same time I got more back. I'm fed up with the results from H&R block, and I'm going Jackson Hewitt or Turbo Tax next year.
We filed our taxes today with the same women we use at h&r block every year. The only difference in our returns this year is we bought a house and had our first baby. Last year we paid $101 bucks which we thought to have been very responsible, until today... After all said and done we got taken for $345 insanity?! We will never go back, such an upsetting experience. Feel like we got ripped off for some commission bonus for this woman. We filed in Fairhaven, Ma. Such a disappointment. Then when I questioned why, I was told because of all the little extras from this year, house, child, child care, etc, etc, etc... We feel like we just got nicked & dimed, not right! We have been loyal patrons, NO MORE!!!!! We will be going elsewhere next year. Another customer lost....
The service was almost laughable. These are the details that matter, as with any given situation these 3 incidents are unacceptable. Direct quote from the "gentleman" who would have assisted us, "That's your problem, not mine." There was also another potential client there that was basically told that to handle an important fax from another branch location out of state on her own, rather than take the time to contact them on their client's behalf. Another woman ultimately walked out due to the disorganization at this location when everyone who was waiting was asked, "Ok, who's next?" Apparently, they weren't keeping track of who was coming in and in what order. This branch wouldn't know customer service if it jumped up and bit them in the behind. I've been a long time customer, but H&R Block has forever lost my business.
I went into H&R block on 1630 N. College St Fort Collins Colorado. The receptionist let me know that I could be seen at 11 o'clock. So I come back at 11 and the receptionist let me know there was a problem and that I would have to wait until 11:30. I said no problem, I wait and ** calls me back. First he tells me he's going to have to charge me extra for coming early. I then told him my appointment was at 11 that he would have to pay me. The receptionist heard our conversation and apologized to him saying that it was her fault there was a mix up. We start to go through my tax information. He was not wanting to fix mistakes made by H&R block the previous year, he would not look at any of my receipts, and when he was finished going through everything he said I would owe a little over 400$. I said I don't have that kind of money on me. He gives me a dirty look and said that "doesn't surprise me." I felt so low. Then he gave me his personal business card and said he could do my taxes cheaper. I was so upset by the way he treated me I went out and cried in my car. Absolutely the worst customer service experience ever!
I would never go to H&R Block to file taxes if you haven't already. I went to the one in Seffner FL had an appointment. The lady sat us down and walk off then started helping someone else. Charged me outrageous amount of money to file. It's been three weeks and still haven't got my money and it's direct deposit. I will never go back. Use Liberty Tax, get your money in a week and cheaper.
So I had never done taxes before and had heard some good things about H&R. After sitting with a Tax "pro" and doing all of the paperwork, I left the office thinking that my taxes were in good hands. After waiting much longer than it should have taken to get my refund, I did some digging and discovered that some of the information in the files was put in wrong. I contacted H&R and was transferred countless times, put on hold and finally emailed a number of forms to fill out that I would have to fax in. Basically H&R messed up my forms and only offered me more things to do to attempt to correct it. The reason I'm upset about all of this is that I went to H&R and paid them my hard earned money to ensure I received an accurate refund in a reasonable amount of time. Neither of these things happened. I will not be using H&R in the future and you had better believe that I will be telling people not to use them. Thanks H&R for taking my money and making tax season that much harder.
Disappointed in the cost of the tax prep when I went in to an office. I had all the info in order & not complex (1040). I was sticker shocked at the end on what I had to pay for 45 min prep $297.00!!! I asked why so much. All the other years it's the same form, same # pages. This is HIGH WAY ROBBERY!! Average hourly rate is about $20 hr??? I want a refund! They advertise &79.99 you prep @ home & they'll look it over. That amount makes more sense.
I went to h& r block for the first time, never had any problems with the irs in the past & because some rookie so called tax specialist forgot to ask me a few questions, I am being audited. I was really depending on my tax returns to catch up on my bills & now I will be delayed by months due to incompetent people who work there. They try to get you done like it's a race, but in the process, screwing people's taxes up. NEVER AGAIN!!! Don't give your surveys until you get your refund & do not get peace of mind, they do nothing for you.
I saw a commercial for H&R Block that said get taxes done for 1/2 of what you paid last year & I had mine done by AARP & it was free & H&R Block won't do it for free. So to me they don't keep true to their word. I guess they don't want to help anyone under middle class.
10 yr. customer with no problems until 2013 glitch in tax software. H&R made good with Peace of Mind. This year glitch again to non existent rep. 3 hours total hold time fixing. Requested different office but my taxes were sent to same office. Additional 2 hours to rectify error. Will not be a return customer next year. Doesn't take me 3 times to figure out they are less than organized and lack quality service.
Paid almost 300.00 to get my taxes done. I will never go back to H&R Block. And the ad they have out "get your billions back", it was referring to the CEO of H&R Block getting the billions not the working people. If not you would not charge me triple the amount I paid last year. You will never rip me off.
We have been going to H&R Block for years and I think we finally will learn next year to stop H&R Block from ripping us off. We went to 580 Ridge Rd in North Arlington N.J. My wife and I filed married filing separately. My wife did her taxes but I will wait. Our preparer was **. My wife's taxes were basic with 2 lottery winning forms. We were showed what was done with the lottery forms. All he did was add $2000 to our taxes for both forms. The sad part was when my wife had to correct the preparer's mistakes at least 10 times. Bottom line was that we paid $314.00 dollars for 1 1/2 hrs work. I know it is our fault for allowing it to happen every year but I will say NO MORE!!!! The only way to make H&R Block think about their ripping off the little hardworking men and women is to stop going to them. I refuse to complain every year then use them again!!!! Goodbye H&R BLOCK TAX RIP OFF PREPARERS.......
I spent an hour listening to the tax preparer talk about her family in an over heated room. She complained about the new system they had to use, all the kinks involved in it. Then a week later, they called to come in and sign and she charged me $158 saying mine was a complicated tax form. It was a 1040 easy, what the hell is complicated about that? I was ripped off and will never use this lousy business again.
I have used H&R Block to file my taxes for the last couple years as it's convenient. They are able to import all the information from the previous year so it avoids a lot of duplicate data entry. Unfortunately the "free" services they advertise are not in fact free. They advertise that e-filing is free, but when I completed all the entry for this year, I was required to pay $19.99; which I did out of sheer exasperation & the desire to get the process over with. When they asked for $35 to e-file my state return, I declined. I live in Oregon and checked the State of Oregon website for free State e-file options and H&R block was listed. I met the income requirements for e-file. I used the link as instructed on the website, but again H&R Block wanted $35 to e-file the return. I tried to live chat with customer service to figure out why, but was disconnected after waiting for about 20 minutes for an agent to be available. I called customer service and waited 25 minutes before giving up. Good product with misleading advertisements and horrid customer service. I recommend trying another service if at all possible.
I just filed my taxes at the local Avon, Indiana office. Last year I paid 180.00, high but I thought reasonable. This year we had the same situation, income, deductions, all the same. I was floored when the REPRESENTATIVE said, that will be 242.00. Not her fault, and she shared that nearly everyone in their office staff was upset and that they knew the increase was going to cost them customers. Next year, it's Jackson Hewitt. Utterly ridiculous. And to boot, in the past I simply handed her the file folder, this year I had to break everything down for her. H & R Block is dead to us...
I filed my taxes with H&R Block in January 2015. When everything was completed and I reviewed the information, the wrong information was showing on the portion that gets sent off to the IRS. I thought I entered the wrong information and went back to edit my W-2 information and what I had entered was correct. H&R Block was not helpful and I now have to file amended return to correct the error that H&R Block made AND pay another 50 dollars for that on top of the 130 dollars they already charged me. I will not use them again!
This is beyond a ridiculous amount of money to pay to file your taxes... they literally charge you for everything. Including $35 for the card they put your money on. Unreal. If you want your money... all of your money, then file with someone else. Way too expensive.
You say you're the best and will stand behind your mistakes. Not true. You people, H&R Block made a big mistake, and turned me away when you did. Nailing me to a cross. And costing me $4000.00. Not nice. Shame on all of you. H&R Block. Never again and you did not care. AGAIN!!! SHAME for your advertising. Very untrue. Shame. But you don't care. The money keeps rolling in. You make mistakes, and just hide them.
I recently tried to file my tax return with H&R Block. I had been filling with them over 5 years. This year I ran into a complete roadblock. My return wasn't filed but sent to some lady who wants to review my return. WHAT THE HEY!! Now I have to send my info to her due to fact that my return can't be filled till she reviews them!! To me this major red flags!! I'm sorry but I have contacted my lawyer about this if my information is leaked out to somebody and they open accounts I don't know about. This is last time I'm filling with them.
I had a 1099, a 1098, and one W2. The only different between 2012 and now was the 1099. They charged me $347 just for that. When I asked why the woman told me it was because of my 1099. JUST MY 1099. I have NO deductions. NO itemization. NOTHING. I am a poor college kid trying to make it in this world like everyone else. You have to pay the money before you leave. The next day, I call HR Block. The lady was super nice and I explained to her how I feel I was vastly overcharged and that I shouldn't have had to pay so much. She said she understood, and she filed a complaint and gave me a case number. She said it would be 3-5 days before I heard anything. That was on 2/6/2015. 6 business days later I still hadn't heard anything, so I called again. The woman I talked to explained to me it was being looked into. I explain to her it should have already been looked into because their 3-5 days were up. She puts her supervisor on the phone. This woman was trying to tell me again because of my 1099 is why I paid TWO HUNDRED dollars more. I told her no. I could have went to a REAL accountant for less than that. She was telling me the same thing, that someone is looking into it. So I tell her the same thing, it should have ALREADY been looked into. She then offers that I go to ANOTHER HR Block store so they can calculate how much I should have paid. I told her no that was their job and I am not wasting any more of my time in their offices to be ripped off. She said that okay then they're looking into it and will call me. When? She cant tell me. I told her it was fine that I would contact a lawyer and they could handle it from there. SHE HUNG UP ON ME. YES A PROFESSIONAL SUPPOSED TO BE HELPING ME HUNG UP ON ME. The very next day, 2/14/2015 they call me to inform me they will not be refunding any of the money they took from me. That because I had a 1099 it was supposed to cost more. You still can't tell me it should be $200 dollars more. I will never use HR Block again. They will completely rip you off. An actual accountant would have been half the cost of HR Block. I wish I would've known that before hand.
This year I decided to use H&R Block. I was under the belief they were efficient and cheaper than other tax preparation services available. I was completely wrong. I feel sorry for the little guy in the green bow tie, because the corporation that he is the front man for is making him look very poorly. My first agitation I had was setting an appointment only to realize that I was queued in a first come first serve basis. I felt like I was at the doctors office. If you make appointments you need to keep appointments. My time is valuable. I do not like sitting for half an hour over the appointment time in room full of crying and annoyed children. Upon realizing that I was in a queue I went to the receptionist and asked for the paperwork to drop off my tax information filled it out and left it with the receptionist. A week later I received a phone call that my taxes where ready to be picked up. I called back and set another appointment this time in the morning due to less customers being there. I waited another half hour in an empty room until I was called to sign my taxes. The representative he had no Idea that I had dropped off my taxes and had to go and search for my file. After apologizing for the inconvenience he showed me what my taxes would be then informed me that I would owe HR block 258.00 dollars for the tax prep. My jaw dropped to the floor. I asked why it was so much and he went on to explain several non essential points about child tax and trailed off and then mentioned something about sticker shock. I realized he did not even know why it was so much, and begrudgingly handed him the money. This is my first time using HR block and I gladly say this is my last time as well. If you are reading this DO NOT use HR Block to file taxes. This corporation is greedy and ran a very good marketing campaign to fool me into thinking it was different.
Recently moved to Richmond VA from Michigan, attempted to locate a place to file taxes and found HR Block not far from my work. I went in skeptical as my wife had spent half the year in Michigan and our return was going to need to include Michigan state tax filing as well as Virginia. I coaxed the preparer Bill for a price estimation, he would not give one. I said well how about a ballpark 50 -100 still he would not comment on a price. I said, well "it's not going to be like $500." He said "no, no nothing like that." Long story short after an hour he totaled it up and advised me "well you're right, nearly $500." I became angry, grabbed my paperwork and left before signing and committing to the return. I think this was terrible. I had never paid more than $150 from a CPA firm. I had student loan, and mortgage interest, W-2's from me and my wife, 6-8 stock trades and personal property taxes on one car. That was it not a difficult return by any means, what a scam at HR block, they should be able to give you a ballpark figure before they spend an hour wasting your time. I am angry with HR block and would never recommend them to anyone. There should be an agency that monitors them. I am now worried they have all my information to do as they please with.
I have been a customer since the 80s, I went in to get my taxes done and got a new tax preparer. He lacked in knowledge and professionalism. My visit took twice as long - I was misinformed, and he argued with me. I have co-workers who paid 9.99 to do their taxes online - I Paid almost 300, the visit was awful. Overpriced and only was offered a coupon for next year - not sure I want to go back next year. Where is the customer service these days???? Not happy.
I had filed my federal tax return using H&R Blocks online software, at the end when they ask how you want your money sent I chose direct deposit and entered my account number twice. They said I never entered one, they said they sent us a check 1/28/15, it would take 7-10 days to receive which we have not. They will not provide us with proof they sent the check and tell us we have to wait 90 days to file a lost check. Meanwhile I have been unable to pay my rent while incurring $5 a day late fees, we are set to buy a house this week and now don't have our down payment, we can't move out of our current townhouse which our lease ends this month, so we will be charged an additional $150 on top of our current rent for a month to month. We are paying big for their system errors and getting no compassion from them at all. We have been lied to for weeks. They have told us several dates the check was sent, different check numbers, excuse after excuse.
I called H&R Block and scheduled an appointment with a young lady. When I asked what kind of fee I should be looking at, she said the base rate was $45. She began to ask me a few questions about my taxes and after I explained it all, she said I should be in the $45 range. Needless to say...it took them less than an hour to do my taxes and my bill was about $190...for an easy form and listing my insurance. Then there was a credit that took me down to about a $130 fee...but then she charged me about another $35 for something. I was filing with TurboTax originally, but just to make sure everything was ok with this insurance and all, I decided to go to H&R Block!! I could have filed everything for free with TT, but instead, H&R came up with the same numbers I did...but it cost me the better part of $165! $45 and $165...I could be wrong, but there's a huge difference. I'm sure the extra $35 fee MAY have been b/c I asked them to take the fee from my taxes, but that's b/c I went in prepared to make a $45-$50 payment, not $165!! This is one place that doesn't have to worry about my business anymore!!!
Normally I do my own taxes through Turbo Tax or Tax Slayer, but I was confused about the health care law and wanted to be able to ask questions about avoiding the penalty. I had a very rough year last year (made the least amount of money I've ever made in a year) and because of that I had to cash in my retirement account. This was the most "complicated" thing on my return. I don't have children, am not married, don't own property or stocks or a business, no student debt or payments, not in the military or have a bunch of gambling losses or anything else that might make my return complicated. How much could that possibly cost you say? Well the tax prep forgot to add my 1099-R, and the price with JUST my W-2's was $190! (With a refund amount of around $630) After she went back and added my 1099-R the price of their services jumped from $190 to $232! (With the refund going from $630 to $430). The tax preparer gave me the little $20 off coupon, making the price $212. Yeah lady, that really helps when you're going to take half my refund for preparing my taxes. I ALMOST said screw it; do it until this additional rip off happened. If you want to pay for the preparation out of your taxes, there is an additional $34.95 charge! Direct deposit or paper check; it does not matter. If you don't have the $200 right then and there they're gonna stick it to you even harder. That was the straw that broke the camels back for me. I told her no thank you...that's just waaaay too much of my refund for doing basically nothing. I went home and did it myself through TaxSlayer. It was super easy to figure out how to file for an exemption for not having insurance. And even with the penalty for withdrawing my retirement early, my refund was over $100 more than what the tax prep they told me, and it was freaking free. Absolutely free! If you don't have complicated taxes, you should really be doing them yourself. It's sooooo easy to just plug in the numbers and there is no reason you should give H&R Block $300 for doing the exact same thing; just plugging in numbers.
My husband and I had our taxes prepared today (2/12/2015) by H &R Block. We do not own any businesses or have anything going on out the ordinary. However, they charged us $459.00 to prepare the standard tax form for submission. I could be wrong, but this seems like overcharging to me. We will pay it but you can believe that they will never, ever, do my taxes again.
Bought 2014 Deluxe version from Walmart. Last year I used H&R 'Basic' and it worked fine, but that of course is pre-Obamacare. After triple checking for accuracy I proceeded to Review and again and again. Each time I got was an error message. It said an 'unresolved issue' relating to a member of my household receiving benefits through healthcare.gov and being over 65. The 'error' could not be concluded by any answer or any combination of answers I gave. This led to a 35 minute wait to chat with a CS person who after 5 minutes of attempting to help was cut off as she tried to share my return. I left it alone, waited for the 2/12/2015 updates, deleted my previous attempt and started from scratch. Hours later, the same problem exists and I'm for what proved to be over 45 minutes to talk to a person. This person tried and couldn't figure it out, suggested it was a software problem and would transfer me to a technical specialist to download another version. I waited for another 20 minutes for the Tech. She seemed confused as to why I was transferred to her, but decided she'd try to help. She was in the process of trying to access my account and link with it when she was cut off. I waited several more minutes thinking I was on hold before realizing that the connection was terminated. At this point I chose to use a competitor's program and in just over an hour and a half later was E-filing my returns. I will never use H & R Block again under any circumstances and I don't recommend them. There were no followup calls and each person who attempted to help seemed in a fog due to inadequate training or a lousy product. Either way, choose a competitor of your choice. I won't go through this again with these clowns.
I purchased and used the H&R Block Premium software download this year and completed my taxes. The software came with 5 free federal e-files. When I went to e-file, the software stated my activation code was invalid and I needed to either pay for it or contact customer service. My complaint is, I had a very very difficult time connecting with an actual person from customer service. I waited for one hour for a live chat agent before I decided to call on the phone. I had to wait on the line for nearly two hours before someone answered my call. The only reason I held that long was I was because I was working and could let the line hang on while working. If I actually had to drop everything and wait, I would've hung up after 10 minutes as my time is too valuable. I would recommend only using their software if you have a simple tax that wouldn't have the need to ever contact a live person. Their customer service was very disappointing.
I dropped off two years taxes for a friend in the 13316 E. Jefferson Detroit, Michigan 48215 office to ** Senior Tax Advisor. She quoted $200.00 for the work. When my female African American friend went in to pick the tax work up she was charged over $400.00. The manager after 5 days of no return phone calls to me said nothing could be done. Please everyone from now on get a quote in writing for the work being done. This was tragic for this woman on a limited income. I would recommend H & R Block 13316 E. Jefferson as having a very bad public relations policy.
They were filing my taxes since 2009. They messed up on my taxes in 2013 and then blamed it all on me saying the paperwork provided by me was bad when the IRS said I owed them. I was charged 250$ and still accountable for their error? So this year I will use TurboTax and do them myself. They were rude on the phone about it and nobody did anything or even admit their error when I had emails from their tax preparer to prove it. Stay away!!!
My husband used H&R Block for all his tax returns before we were married. I have always prepared my own. Because he whines a lot, I told him I would try H&R with him our first year filing taxes together. The representative did not even ask HALF of the credits and deductions I knew about myself, and continued to skip over massive chunks of questions and information. I had already partially prepared my own taxes, so I had an idea of how much we SHOULD get... at the end of everything, he had us owing more for state and getting much less for federal. Then there was the fee of 250.00 to file. I promptly said absolutely not and walked out with my information. There is no requirement to file your taxes with a company after they have prepared it. The amount they charge is outrageous, it is easier and efficient to do so with an online program like Turbo Tax. I would not recommend H&R's website either, as I tried that one year and it was completely ridiculous.
I spoke to 3 representatives. They couldn't tell me why yesterday I had the option to transfer money from my checking account to my emerald card, but today I do not. Each agent said the same thing, "That option may not be available to all users, would you like to receive information on other options to reload your card (all cost money)?" They were all clearly reading from a script. With each agent I had to state the problem repeatedly because they kept giving me answers to different questions. They treated me like I was stupid and tried to walk me through setting up an account online even though I had just told them that I was looking at my online account (all three of them did this). The last few years I went into the office to have my taxes done in person, this year I did them through the H&R Block website. I've never had a problem with the service in that regard, but because of this experience I will never do any business with them again! In addition, upon looking at other services ex. TurboTax, H&R Block is extremely overpriced.
My son went to the local H&R Block for his taxes. This was the first time he ever had to file a tax return. He saw online that it was $9.99. The accountant never told him what the price was and did not explain the process, and ended up charging my son $90 for a 1040EZ form. It took the accountant 5 minutes to prepare the return. I stopped in the office the next day to speak with a manager, but she was not available. The person at the reception desk gave me the hours she was going to be in next. There was another woman who was an accountant came over to me and asked if she could help. I told her I needed speak with the manager. She pried and pried and then another guy also pried and wanted to know the problem. I told them only that my son had met with Jim and I was not happy with the outcome. They asked, "what did he do?" They were more interested in gossip than anything else. I thanked them, and left. The next day I called to speak to the manager. My call went to a call center since the manager was busy. The call center would not alert the manager that I called unless she was able to complete a "profile" on me. They needed my full name, phone number, email, and physical address just to leave a message to have the manager return my phone call. I hung up and called again and the local office answered the phone this time. I spoke with the manager. She made no apologies for the price or the treatment of my son and said, "this is business" and that is how much an EZ form cost at our company. She also said that she already heard about me and it is "all over her office". How unprofessional. My son learned a valuable lesson that day. "Buyer Beware".
Just found out last year that their tax guy I've had for the past 3 years has been ripping me off for money over charging me for fees. He was also so sarcastic and hurtful and made remarks about my returns and laughed at them. They don't hesitate to call me twice a day to do my taxes but when I call no one helps me or calls back. Don't depend on them calling me back and I'm always waiting when I go in. I'm moving on to another company. I'll pay the extra $$ to get treated better.
I went to HR Block to file 2013 on Main St. in East Orange, NJ to file. The agent didn't inform me that I was not required to file if I did not make at least $11,000. As a widowed, single, retired person on SS, I was not required to file based on my SS amount. The gentleman who took care of me, looked at my documents and stated that he had previously lived in a city that I had once lived in also. He was sitting at his computer and typing in info while shooting the breeze with me. After a while he turned to me smiling and said "I have good news for you". It worked out perfectly. You don't owe anything. He then turned the computer monitor to face me and showed me I owed "zero" amount. The point is... this gentleman knew as soon as he looked at my documents, that I didn't even have to file a tax return, but said nothing, just to get a fee. He should have said, "Sir, since you didn't have any income last year, and based on the amount of SS you received, you don't have to file a return". The following year I went online to the IRS website and found a section where I could enter my info and answer a few questions and found out that I wasn't required to even file a tax return. Then I realized that the employee at H&R block had scammed me and then charged me. I think this is a disgrace, that they could see a senior citizen, look at my information and see what little Social Security I was receiving, and then lie and cheat me like that. Then they even had the nerve to call and email me last year and then again this year, to remind me that it was time to file again. There should be some way to shut this office down. They clearly don't mean the community any good.
Went to H and R on the 5th to file my taxes. On the 6th I was told that the IRS rejected my return due to somebody used my kids as dependents. She tried many times taking 1 of my kids off 1 at a time and running it again. Now my return needs to be mailed in paper form. H and R block told me they won't mail them to pay for their filing of my taxes that they messed up and my taxes still are not filed. $493.95.
I would not recommend anyone to use H&R block to file Tax Return. Their website is not transparent and straightforward regarding the fee you need to pay for Federal and State Return. Unless you file Federal return, they won't tell you that you will be charged $37 for filing State Return. A very cryptic website. I was looking for reasonable tool to file my tax return. But, I ended up paying more than $50. It's expensive than most of the others tool. I won't recommend this to anyone.
I have been a H&R Block customer for over 25 yrs. This year was the most worse time I ever had with H&R Block. They charged me $360.00 and that's not rapid refund either. For my 25 yrs of giving them my business H&R Block never attempted to Thank me nor offer me a discount. My Brother went to Jackson & Hewitt to do his taxes this year. Jackson & Hewitt charged him $120.00 and gave him a $50 gift card. 25 years of my business to H&R Block and they didn't offer me bleep. I was told that H&R Block will send me update emails of the status of my refund. To date I never receive one email update from them. I was never offered the H&R Block emerald card. The service H&R Block gave me for charging me $360.00 was poor to none. The H&R tax rep never even offered to give me her business card. $360.00 for what? I could of went else where for cheaper or efiled online for $50 if not for free. The H&R tax rep that did my returns never attempted to ask me if it was ok to charge me that amount. I didn't know how much it was gonna cost me until after she already sent my returns to the State & IRS. Accepted is all what I was told. I'm very upset and sad how H&R treated and charged me. After 25 yrs this is how they treat their long time customers! Sad it is. I will never go back to H&R Block again. Poor service and overcharges us filers. If you call H&R to ask a question none of them know a thing.
Funds locked up and no explanation why, just a recording saying they're having technical difficulties. I just got out of the hospital. Went to go buy my medicine and guess what? I cannot use my card. It said declined in front of everybody in Wal-Mart. Very humiliating.
My family had a scheduled appointment to file our 2014 taxes. We made the appointment because we have a 2 year old and preferred not to wait like a walk-in client. It has been 45 minutes so far and have still not been assisted. This location is at 3451 Goodman Road, Southaven, MS. Do NOT use this location.
Never told me they didn't give a free estimate. I went in and was going through the steps and when they were finished they told me I had to pay 177 dollars plus 35 dollars because they had to take it out of my taxes coz I didn't have the money to pay it in cash and another 35 dollars in cash so instead of 580 back I'm getting 300 dollars. I'm so furious.
Customer service is horrible and they sent my refund to the wrong account and now I have to wait even longer to receive it and they keep giving me the run around. I will never do business with them again.
Last year at this establishment (6611 Bergenline Ave., West New York, New Jersey). I made an appointment and waited over two hours. This year I made an appointment and the individual who I made the appointment with is not even here. Most unprofessional organization I've had the misfortune of dealing with. What if you made an appointment with a doctor and when you arrive they are not there and unreachable on the phone? GO SOMEPLACE ELSE!!! Consequences - give up a valuable portion of your life to be disrespected.
This is my three years using h&r block but I will never going back there again. I went the one on Mack rd and franklin, and they charge me so much!! They ripped off their customers pretty much. Whoever the person I talk to on the phone was also very rude. Not very professional!! I would never recommend this company to anyone.
First, I would like to say that I am very disappointed in the local H&R Block office. I first attempted to schedule an appointment online. While trying to do so, the company appointment webpage was having issues. So I then call the office and schedule the appointment with the desk attendant. After verifying the appointment time for 7 pm several times, I then verify that they have our information from previous years. My daughter and I arrive at the office at 6:45 pm, check in with the desk attendant. She states that the person we will be working with is still working with another client. We take a seat and wait for my husband who arrived at 6:55 pm. While we were waiting, two other couples walked in, one of which worked with my husband and stated that they originally had an appointment for Saturday but since they have to work Saturday (due to our weather), they wanted to see if they could get them done tonight (which tells me they did not have an appointment for this evening). Both couples are taken back to two different tax prepares and both left while we were still sitting there. At 7:30 pm, a tax professional comes out from around the corner and states she is sorry for the wait, it won't be much longer. At 7:45 pm (45 minutes after our appointment time), she comes back out and states that she is still not ready for us and can we can leave our stuff and come back another time or she can see if anyone else "wants to take us," even though there are 3 other tax employees in the office without any clients. Several minutes later, she comes back and says that she can't help us right now and no one else will be available for another 30 minutes (again, not one of them was with a client) so she will try to hurry and then take us back. Meanwhile, we wait a few more minutes, and another couple comes in. They check in at the desk and state they have an appointment at 8 pm. That couple sits down for literally a minute or two, and a tax professional comes out and calls them back. REALLY?? We have now been waiting for almost an hour with a toddler (even though we made an appointment), when there are several employees in the office with no clients, then they take a couple who scheduled an appointment an hour after ours, and immediately help them and still tell us there is no one available to help us. This is unexceptionable behavior for any company and I will make sure to tell all our family and friends who we normally refer to H&R Block that they should take their business elsewhere.
I went to H&R Block today (2-9-15) to have my taxes done. This is my third year. My issue is the no out of pocket. Since I live on paycheck to paycheck I couldn't pay out of pocket this year. After the long process doing my taxes I went for the no pay out of pocket. When it was finished the tax preparer told me I had to have my spouses ID. I told her I would have to go back home to get it. So when I got back to H&R Block I was told there was a problem. After being there for an hour and a half and driving back home to get my spouses ID I was a little frustrated. I asked what was the problem. They said I couldn't do the no pay out of pocket because I had to do a injured spouse form. I asked what does the injured spouse form have to do with no pay out of pocket? They said the bank does not want to wait a few extra weeks for their money. Also I paid the last two years 85 dollars for the preparation and since we made an extra 200 dollars the fee this year was 165 plus 35 for the no pay out of pocket. So 200 to have them do our taxes. I told them. No Way!!!! We are now doing our taxes for 50 dollars online.
Get your money back America? The place you have to get it back from is their bank. H&R Block bank does not give out bank statements. The bank has increased this year of 2015 their fee for non-use from $2.50/month to $4.50/month. If you make a calculation error and forget you have a little cash left on the card, it's gone. The fees will just eat it away month after month, year after year. You signed the small print. Now you know where the billions dollars went.
I've filing my taxes with H&R Block for the past 6 years. I've been doing them with Robert and last year, they moved him to West Side, Jersey City so this year, I called to make an appointment with him. They set it up. When I get there, they give me while different person because Robert is sick. His name is Christopher and he don't know what he doing. He got back hardly any money and messed up my bank information so now I have to wait longer for my refund because he messed up. I would never go back to them again.
Site is slow, crashes at times and filing one w-2 Federal e-file and one w-2 State e-file was over $91.00. RIP OFF!!!
After 4 years using Turbo Tax to file on line, I fell for the H&R Block ad stating "File for free and only $9.99 for state." Well, Free has cost me more $120 and 5 hours with still no taxes filed. Turbo tax was quick and easy and cost $69 with no hidden fees. It took 20 minutes and done. This year, I went to the free H&R block site and spent nearly an hour going through their process. It is anything BUT intuitive. When I finished, I was given some lame excuse why I could not e-file and that I need to click on "next" to print my return and mail it in. So I click on next and am taken to a payment page where I am being charged $22. I entered payment information and click next. My payment was process and I was taken to a home page. "What, no printed tax forms to mail in?" The page offers no other options than to log in. So I did. Went through the same gyrations and paid 3 times. 3 TIMES! Now I look frantically for an 800 number and there is nothing anywhere. You can look all over the website for help and there is NOTHING! So I defer to a Google search where I find a number. After more than an hour on hold, (yes I realize it's tax season, but I am out more than $120 and still have not gotten anything filed, or printed) an HOUR! Finally a gentleman answers and we walk through every last piece of my return, federal and state, another hour, this is no exaggeration, an hour on the phone and he tells me "I'm sorry but I can't help and need to transfer you to a higher level of support. Are you ready for this? I am transferred to a line where they tell me that this is the wrong center and THEY cannot help me at all. And guess what? They tell me to do. They give me the exact same 800 number where I was just on the line for more than 2 hours. Now I am on hole again going on 50 minutes. Still out more than $120 for my "free" tax return. Still nothing printed and nothing filed.
Was told us that you e filed it then turn around and told that it wasn't. Then was told I needed to come in to sign some papers but that wasn't the case, they wanted to tell me I owed them money before they could send it. So the next day I got a call and then message, then I had to call them back so tell me that they wanted me to pay the fees upfront that they couldn't he file for me.
We approved our 2013 tax return on April 14, 2014 to be electronically submitted by H&R Block to the IRS. It is now February 4, 2015 and our taxes have still not been submitted. I have made numerous calls to H&R Block and the IRS and no one seems to know what happened. I read online that there were issues with a change to a form about education loans that may have created the problem, but they still can't figure it out??? I finally printed a paper copy of the tax return and submitted it myself to the IRS. I am extremely frustrated because I know fines and penalties are mounting. Very frustrated - and don't forget I paid for this service. Well I won't ever go back to H&R Block and I will warn anyone I see against it. You would think they would have offered to refund my money, but no, no offer of compensation at all.
I called H and R Block before I went in for a scheduled appointment to ask if they could give me a number based on my information; and the lady tells me yes it should be under one hundred dollars due to tax bracket and the fact I make about $4.95 AN HOUR... As a waitress etc etc. Got all done with process and they tell me over $300... as I'm begrudgingly getting it done anyway, sick to my stomach I hear another lady telling a gentlemen his should be "About one hundred"... so nauseating.
H&R BLOCK at 3609 30th Avenue, Astoria, NY 11103 = AS WORST OFFICE. ** CALLS HERSELF BOSS - IS VERY ABUSING, TOUCHING, AND HOLDING PEOPLE UNFAMILIAR. ** ALSO USES DISCRIMINATORY COMMENTS; e.g. is: "I am from Russia, Romania, Yugoslavia, etc. and YOU? You look Romanian??? Where are you from???" "Oh, myself ** and my family, we are Sicilians, like criminals; you hurt me, my son will fix you!!!" Who needs this??? They prepare taxes in such ways that force you sign your forms first and the real charges come after; and, they answer "you signed". Must pay!!! And $35.00 to represent you. On what? For what? H&R Block charged me: a $13,000.00 gross income - a $270.00 fees for a simple filling and NO DEDUCTIONS. THEY IGNORE BASICS AND RULES OF GOOD BUSINESS.
This is a good review. I filled my taxes again with my same tax person again who always work so hard to get my taxes done in an efficient way. Tyrone ** is always a polite and professionalism person. He goes the extra mile to get you the refund you deserve. I like how he has a strong relationship with his staff. They all are respectful, just a friendly environment. I recommend anyone to go to his office at 4520 Atlantic Ave Long Beach,CA 90807. He's one of the best. Please commend him for his hard work. Thank you.
I went in Monday evening just to see if I could make an appointment, or be seen as a walk in. My husband doesn't get off of work till after 4pm, and we headed in after he came home. We walked up to an angry receptionist, she was a black woman. Even before we could ask if we could be seen, she was yelling at another woman who worked there and proceeded to make her cry. My husband and I were both shocked as we witnessed this and decided to go elsewhere. This place is horrible, and to think H&R Block hires people like this to help our men and women in service is very offensive to me.
I had a problem with one of the products downloaded from HRBLOCK.COM. I called and was put on hold by the automated system. I was on hold for 2 hours and 15 minutes when the call was suddenly terminated. I tried again the next day and have now been on hold for 1 hour and 10 minutes and still holding. I'm so sick of hearing "thank you for continue to hold... Your call will be answered by the next available agent". Customer service could not be worse!!!!!!!!!!! "Thank you for continuing to hold...Your call will be answered by the next available agent..." That agent was still a toddler when I called!
Well the lady did my taxes last year and I owed I paid the amount. Then two months later I get a letter from IRS that wasn't the full amount. I owed another 700 something dollars. If I wanted a forecast I would have watched the weather channel. PEOPLE YOU ARE BETTER OFF SAVING THE 200 DOLLARS DOING THEM YOUR SELF. Our go to real tax person that cares who you are and about your business not some company. You’re just a number to and a dollar amount. Real tax person is never ever wrong with numbers.
H&R Block is a ripoff!! I paid $300 last year and I got back $8000 back on my return with H&R Block. This year H&R Block charge me $430 and I'm getting back $6500. Nothing change on my taxes besides my dependent instead of 2 I'm claiming 1.. H&R Block is charging all their customers more every year due to all their commercial on TV!!! I will never ever go back to H&R Block. I remember first going to H&R Block 2007, paying less than $200 and now it's $430. God Truth.
Online they say that Federal Return is free as a promo. State submission was $9.99. After entering all information and getting to the end, it gives me the option of paying $61 that includes a loyalty discount of $10. Otherwise this would have cost me $71. I had attached the photo evidence so that HRBLOCK either pays me back the dues or at least new users would understand the pricing better. This same exact review I had submitted on their website which they chose not to publish. I was surprised to see that the H&R block censored my feedback and sent me a note that my review did not meet guidelines and hence is being rejected :-) I am sure like me, many others will be frustrated reaching the end of the submission where the promo rate doesn’t apply. TurboTax as well as Intuit cost almost the same, but at least they do not put $9.99 promo pricing and then charging a consumer $60 at the end. Out of curiosity, I went and checked last year what I had paid being a first timer with H&R Block. I had paid about $58. So you would think, this year paying $61 isn't bad. But the catch is that I paid $61 after $10 discount was applied to my account for being a loyal H&R Block customer. So it still doesn't seem right. I just wanted consumers to be aware that whatever H&R Block claims for pricing comparison with other competitors, doesn't hold true.
I would strongly recommend people stay away from this professional rip off artist company. They will not tell you how much a tax return process will cost, instead saying "it varies" or we won't know until it's done??? I almost fell off the chair when they charged close to $300.00 for a simple return!! Charges like "Peace of Mind"? I have to pay to GET peace of mind. Ridiculously high fees.... Stay away from them!!!
Don't let H&R Block touch your taxes!!! A few years ago my local office was running behind and I had to get back to work. The tax prep person told me to leave my documents and she would finish things up. When I went back to pick up my completed return all I got back was the computer print out. I asked several times about my documents and was told that all I had coming back to me was the print out. Now I have a tax bill from the state for that year because H&R Block made a mistake and I don't even have the documents to argue. I asked H&R Block to refund the tax prep fee for that year and they refuse.
H&R Block figured my income tax in 2012 & their off the street people calculated my taxes incorrectly. They did not figure in my CSR retirement. As a result I received money back. After a period of time, there is no tax on retirement. I thought I had gotten to that point. My mistake - I had not, I should have checked it. I took my 2013 tax to them to calculate. This is when they found the error. As a result, they filed an amendment for 2012 & 2013. This resulted in me owing IRS over $24,000. They were supposed to have filed a claim with their insurance co. I don't know whether they did & can't find out. When I visit their office to find out, they promise to find out & call me. I have yet to receive a call, & no money has been received. What is the solution??
In 2013 I moved to Arizona from another state. I didn't know the state taxes in my new state, plus I had sold my home in my old state. I am a senior on limited income, and could not afford to make a mistake. Block took my tax forms and the information from the sale of the house, took 3 weeks to get back to me to tell me I didn't need to file, and charged me $200. I will never recommend Block to anyone. I feel they are not doing the work for their customers, but just out to see how much they can charge. I have used other tax people occasionally, and never felt like I was ripped off, but this time I felt I was. The auditor who did the work was very disorganized, had excuses, and was just not professional. This was a horrid experience, and one I will never repeat.
I use turbo tax. This year because of the healthcare law it kept rejecting my return so I decided to try HR block. I scheduled an appointment and made it earlier than I was supposed to be. The staff didn't greet us when we came in. When we were greeted he asked if we had an appointment or not. We did. He told us she'd be right with us. We sat down, not very long and was addressed by this lady. Now for someone that deals with people you'd think would have some kind of manner, began asking me what kind of taxes I had, being the one who was going to pay them to do mine, knowing if I knew what kind of taxes they were, I'd do them. I looked to my wife dumbfounded not knowing how to answer. She said w2s, hsa, and as I caught on I told her what they were. Ask she very rudely interrupted me to tell me they may not have time for me. But I had an appointment... After being interrupted two more time while trying to tell her we had an appointment... She realized this. Said she thought we were just walk ins. Walk ins or not we should haven't been talked to the way we were. Told me to have a seat they'd be with us in a minute. My appointment was for 1:30. At this time it's 1:45 and I'm wondering why make the appointment...We decided to leave and go elsewhere!
First time buyer of H&R block tax software, and the last time I ever buy it. It has been over two hours since I contacted their customer service, over the phone as well as their chat support, no response yet. I suppose you get what you pay for, it may be cheaper software, but you pay the price for getting no support at all.
We have used H&R block every year we been together which is 10 but next year I am using another tax agent. Not only did the woman put my name on almost our entire return (my space and husbands) but she mixed up our kids socials and never asked if we wanted the insurance after we thought about it. I'm actually a li’l worried whether it was done right at all. Said once again, "oh yea its 9.99." Again 350.00. I mean really it was the worst preparer I think I ever had. Thinking I may go out and get another look by someone else after this one! Oh and I can add proof when I get to my house. Ugh.
I bought the disk for $65.00 for one federal and one state download. I lived in multi states so I needed two. When I went to receive the state down loads. The second one was $40.00. And neither download was ready. I was told they would be ready by 01/29. Then they changed it to 03/05. I was told it was not ready because I had a Mac. The box clearly states it's made for a Mac. It should not take three weeks to do your taxes because the product is not ready to use. I usually use another company and never have had these issues. The extra download at the other company is $20 and downloads are always available to use. I asked about a refund, you can send the package to H & R with the reason you are returning or not happy with it. And then you wait 6 to 8 weeks to get your refund.
So I was lured in by the online e-file of free federal tax filing and $9.99 state filing. I jumped on. Cheaper than going to an HR block store. So I started my simple, one W2 return. The option of upgrading to the $19.99 came up which included the state/fed filing and the 2013 import of tax info. So, I did it. Still cheaper than visiting a physical location. I got through the process of adding my W2, a screen popped up saying my state filing fees went to $37. No explanations. I continued on, still cheaper than a physical location. I finished all of the filing, got to the last screen about charges, and it totaled to $62! More than going to a physical HR block store. I apparently was charged for filing my federal taxes, despite the "free federal filing" lure.
They lied to me just to get my money. Keep telling me when I call that it will be at my bank tomorrow and then I check IRS and it still says it's being processed. Neelam is a liar and don't let her do your taxes. Worst experience ever.
I filed my taxes. Not only did they charge me 250.00 to do them but my brother went to liberty five days after me and he gets his back this Friday and I can't find out why my taxes is taking so long.
On 1/26/15 I did my taxes at a local office. I was told when I made the appointment that I would be charged $70 to complete my taxes. When the preparer was done he informed me that it was going to be $190 which forced me to take the emerald prepaid card to get my tax added onto. They then would take their fee from the emerald card as well as any charges that came along with having the card. I would still have to wait the ten to twenty one days to receive my money which was OK. On the 28th I still could not find out any information on my filing status. I called the h&r block office where I was told by the secretary that everyone taxes that were done there were rejected because the IRS Gave h&r block the wrong ID number? She couldn't explain any further because she didn't know anything except that they're trying to fix the problem. Now I'm in limbo with my tax information and I paid them $190 for this? I'm not happy with them and will not be returning again for their services.
My wife and I had been customers of H&R Block for 10 and 7 years respectively. When tax season came around for 2015, we scheduled an appointment for January 29, 2015 at 9:00 am at this location. We showed up at 9:00 to find the store darkened, doors locked, no one answered the phone and no one answered when we knocked. At about 9:10, we left and returned at 10:00 to reschedule. Not only did the two individuals manning the store refuse to apologize for failing to show up for the appointment, they lied to my face saying they had been present since 9:00. Furthermore they said they thought my wife and I had no-called/no-showed. They refused to do anything to try to make it right with us, and had the gall to ask if we wanted to reschedule. All of this could have been avoided with a simple apology, instead of lies and CYA tactics. I don't want these untrustworthy, morally bankrupt people handling my taxes. Totally lacking in integrity. I will be taking my business elsewhere.
Went to H&R Block yesterday and filed my taxes. Income and taxes paid in where almost identical from the year prior. The only thing that changed on my return was a purchase of our first home (this should increase return, which it didn't even affect it either way) which isn't the problem. After finishing up with the same type of return from the year prior, the lady hit us with their charge of $150. I know it isn't much compared to other's returns but me and my wife have a simple return and are only in the 15% bracket. So after paying her, I figured they weren't sticking it to me and after I paid, she gave me a receipt with no info on why it was so much, just a basic receipt. I asked her then why it was so much cause the receipt didn't have anything on it except total. She couldn't tell me why or provide me with why. So I left and called a different H&R Block and questioned them, and they pulled up my stuff and the lady (supervisor) told me she'll call me back, no call of course. I called a different H&R Block after, most others were closed and told them to cancel it, if they can't explain the fees, I don't want the service. At this point I was told I can't cancel it, I just dealt with the no more than 3 hours prior. I just want my stuff to be canceled with them and my money back. I am so pissed at the lack of knowledge and support from them. If they were able to explain the fees, I would of looked at them and decided if everything was correct. But at this point I just want everything between me and H&R Block to be done and my money refunded. Horrible customer service. Example to situation. You don't go to a supermarket and get $300 of groceries and they just hand you a receipt that only says $300 on it without it being itemized. I only paid cause I expected a receipt with what the charges were and would of looked it over to see if there was any mistakes. But upon questioning because the receipt had only a total and not being made aware of why, I didn't even have the option to cancel it. This is like a sick joke. I just want my fees back and everything canceled and I'll go elsewhere. Over 10 years dealing with them and first time with horrible service and last time.
E-filing with H&R, somehow the information I inputted does not match what is on my tax return. I have two dependents and my e-file only claims one. I went back through my answers (all correct). Thinking I must have made the mistake, I rechecked again and again everything correct. So I printed the pages from my personal information summary as verification. A customer cannot see the 1040 or 1040A tax return form. You can only view and print after agreeing to their terms and submitting to the IRS. It is a difference of $2000 and not a sole person to talk to regarding the error. H&R Block premium e-file service fees total around $80, I am a paying customer. Hoping to get somewhere, I called the district office closest to me, which was the McHenry Office in Modesto, CA. I need to make sure there is a correction to the e-file. I called the 1-800-HRBLOCK three times waiting over 45 minutes before hanging up. I was informed by the receptionist that there is no agent at the office that is qualified on e-file. I left a message for her to give to the office manager to return my call. I never received a call. I am positive that there is glitch in their e-file program. The only way for me to request an audit is if the IRS sends me a letter. The IRS cannot see the original information I inputted. HR Block answer to this is that I should have not done my taxes myself, for a minimal fee of $400 I could have had an agent in an office do them. Tomorrow I am driving down to the district office and getting some answers. I needed to let others know. Terrible customer service. .
Few weeks ago I have received in the mail tax program disk for 2014 from H & R Block, the material sent clearly printed that: the federal program and one state program is free to include 5 free federal e-files and one free state e-file is free. When I downloaded the programs from the disk it require me to pay $14.99.
I used H&R block once and only once. They charged me $350 to do my taxes. Stay away and they will continue to call you every year.
Jan 24th of 2014 I go online to h&r block to get an estimate on how much I would get back on my taxes. It told me my refund would Be $753 plus 73 state return so I go to an actual h&r block to see an estimate. It came out to $1850 which was okay with me then h&r block calls me Jan 25th to tell me my application was rejected. Because I already So I was furious so go on online to check the h&r block site. It said I submitted my forms but I never sent anything. I'm homeless. I worked my butt off all year and there's no way I'm willing to settle for 850 when I know I'm eligible for more. I need help. How do I resubmit my taxes correctly. It was my first time.
I have used HR Block online for years and I am appalled that they are charging the general public outrageous prices for something that is suppose to be free. The government is cautioning the public about fraud and scam artists this tax season but who knew it was talking about reputable companies like HR Block, Turbo Tax, Tax Act and get this Free File USA. They all charge you to file any forms other than a 1040Ez or 1040A. The other scam is they tell you if you pay for software you should not be charged to file a state return but all of them are charging a fee to file one. I say everyone should go back to mailing in their returns and make the government stop this price gouging from tax software companies. They know you need the money so they are holding you over a barrel so don't let them. Mailing will help the strapped postal service as well. So people mail in that return please!!!
I went to the Alexandria, IN branch where I was told my tax professional would be with me shortly. After waiting 35 minutes a woman who clearly had no knowledge of the software started my taxes. When finished I found that my refund was less than last year by a lot even though I made four times as much claiming 0 exceptions all year despite having two children and just buying a home. After walking her through her own software my refund was corrected. This was a horrible experience. One more thing, my fee for filing HOH spouse and child $40,000 income cost me a whopping $287.00. This is my last regretted year with H&R Block.
I filed online and was so frustrated when my return got rejected! I made calls and waited on the phone for so long that I drove to the H&R Block (while still on hold)! I went to my local H&R Block in Jackson on Parnall Road, I told them my issues and Mike promptly helped me and discussed everything with me. He walked me through it, made me feel welcomed. He walked me to the door and welcomed me back with any future problems. Before Mike, I was so upset with the company! H&R Block is lucky to have him on the team!
I filed my taxes with them. They tell me that my return got rejected because someone else tried using my social to file. They tell me I have to mail my return to the IRS, but I have to pay them an amount of 327 to get my w2 back to mail to the IRS. This is my third year with them, I don't understand why I pay for that peace of mind if it's not gonna protect anything.
My husband and I have dealt with hr block for a while. We applied for the advance. We made our required payment for January. Checked our account a week later and they took every dime we had. After disputing with them told us 1-3 days to put back on. Ridiculous. They took it off without notice and it was everything we had. Finally put it back on the next day but kept $30 in interest that was already paid for the month. We are done dealing with them. When it comes to the customer service they are completely useless and don't have a clue. We will also no longer be using the emerald card or their services. They take your money without any remorse. I would not recommend them to anyone.
Their website says it's free to file if you meet the two qualifications listed, which I did. However when you get further into the process, it tells you that if you need to file a form EIC for the earned income credit, then it's not free, you must upgrade to the basic edition which is $19.95. I clicked on the box where it tells you the "free" supported forms and the EIC form is listed. Of course there is no number to call in and question so I had to look it up and when I did get to an agent, he confirmed that they no longer offer the "free" filing if you need to file form EIC. He said it changed on January 8th. Here it is January 19th and they have not updated any of their information. I think it's a bait and switch scam. He made it sound as if it's some sort of "federal" compliance something or other, which maybe, but why would I believe them now. I will check around. He did also try to get me to confirm on the phone that I would be upgrading to the "basic" from the "free". I told him NO. I don't know what I am going to do now. I may just file a paper return or go someplace else if they are truly free. He insisted on getting all of my personal information, name, zip code, phone number and SSN. I sure hope my return does not get messed up if I decide to go with another company now.
Average tax return. Charges for miscellaneous forms amounted to over 400 dollars. Absolutely ridiculous. Over the years, regardless of various situations, I've never spent more than 120 dollars.
Have purchased their software for years- this year I bought the highest price one. Have always been able to import W-2s with no problem. After 3 phone calls (was told on the first one it would be fixed by the 15th of Jan), I am still not able to import- last 2 calls on the 15th. They told me they have until the 31st of Jan. to get it fixed. They don't really know. What do I buy this for, if I have to put everything in by hand- and what other problems (glitches) is there in the software that may mess up my return? I will be buying other tax software- maybe even for this year. I want to get my taxes done early- may or may not have a refund, but I would like to know- I started a business this year! Very unhelpful at customer support. What tax company doesn't get their own glitches fixed?
I had problems with my federal returns, due to job loss, I failed to file returns for a few years. I contracted with an "expert" with H&R to bring me up to date, and to do an offer in compromise on my behalf. That was in March of 2014. Nine months later, and $1,000 paid in fees, I am no further than I was in the beginning. After 30 phone calls never returned, and 40 emails never answered, I finally turned it over to a lawyer. H&R's legal office said there was no "real" problem with this response.
I did my taxes with H & R block for the first time online, because I usually do them in one of their offices or I do my own taxes online with Intuit, no problems! I was told that H & R block online was pretty good, so I decided to go online. The first thing they want is for uploaded tax W2's, so that is what I did and then went on to do the taxes. Everything was okay and I submitted all, no problem. I just received a letter in the mail from the IRS, stating that I owe over $7,000,00 for unreported income. I go online to see where my uploaded information is and cannot bring it up, and I can only bring up the taxes for 2013 and nothing else shows, no W2's, nothing I input is even on the prepared documents. I go to an H & R block office and sit with a tax adviser and she states maybe I did not upload them, because it does not show, meanwhile, I brought all the documents with me to show her that I have them and that I did in fact upload them. WHO wants the IRS on them, I never had a problem like this before, I pay my taxes. The tax advisor is trying to blame me. NO Way! I will ever use them again for anything. I will go back to Intuit, where I never had problems!
The service is free for federal filings only - with a nominal fee for state filings. I chose to file the state return myself separate from HR Block free program. When I selected this particular option, the system would not allow me to file my Federal returns - I became caught in an endless loop of next/back options. I attempted to call the technical support line, but they informed me technical support (via telephone) is not available with the free program. I then called customer service who asked me to hold, then hung up on me. BE WARNED. AVOID HR BLOCK ONLINE PROGRAM!
I used HR Block AT Home software to compute my 2012 and 2013 taxes. I received a letter from the IRS stating that the capital gains taxes were not computed correctly and a bill for the difference plus interest penalties. I started communicating with HR Block on 21 October 2014 to resolve the issues. I have faxed, emailed, and had 3 separate phone conversations with HR Block. To date after 10 weeks all I get is excuses. I have submitted my return to them twice and they now claim it will take 4-8 weeks from the last time (8 Dec 14) I submitted the return. Now on my first call back in October the representative pulled up my return on the computer and told me they had what they needed and just FAX the IRS letter. They kept hinting that I had unreported income on my 2012 return however the IRS letter and my return both show the same amount of income. The only issue remains how the capital gains tax was computed using the HR Block software. Shouldn't be that hard and certainly 10 weeks is enough time.
Their mistake is costing me $2,800. Oops, we put $8,017 of your pensionable earnings into the Union dues line on accident. Is this what I paid for? Thanks a lot. Now I owe the government almost $3,000. I could have messed up my own taxes for free.
H&R Block hires seasonal employees without experience. Does H&R Block background check of their employees? Since they are able to see the client's social security numbers. I acknowledge that a documents falsifier of Rancho Cucamonga, CA 91739 has been hired by H&R Block.
H and R block had me buy peace of mind where should there be any penalties with taxes with the state or federal, they would represent me. I got audited and wonder how I made the error if they filed the taxes for me. They have denied the claim to cover the penalties yet I purchased the insurance to cover the errors they may do. I am out 10 thousand dollars and coming out of my pocket. They have refused to give me proof of what they did even though they even had me sign a power of attorney to represent me. My income is being garnished due to the error they made. How is this the right thing to do and why are they still in business And if I have this complaint am sure there is more people out there. Please let me know who you are. I would like to have proof of other people with the same problem to prove that they did the wrong thing and should be held accountable.
I have never done my taxes as I felt I lacked the knowledge to do them. I have had H&R Block to do them for 17 years. I was advised that I could deduct my mileage to/from work as I drove 75 miles. I am being audited now facing interest from 2012. I also will have to pay for 2013. Thank goodness I took the peace of mind for 2013. Representative missed the scheduled appointment with the IRS, had me sign the wrong power of attorney forms and I am still waiting for a resolution. I feel it's crazy that I depended on them and I now have to pay for something they advised me to do!
Due to a retirement buyout that was directly invested, I was unsure of how to prepare my taxes for 2014. Instead of trying to attempt them myself I took all of the documents related to filing my taxes to H&R BLOCK. Once prepared I was apparently receiving a refund of approx $5,000.00. I repeatedly asked if they were correct and stated I did not need to get anything from taxation asking for the money back. I was assured they were correct and the employee had another employee check them over. They both agreed they were correct. Approximately two weeks later I received my refund from taxation and used it to pay various things. Later on I received a letter from taxation asking for any documentation I had to support the investment. I responded with a detailed account of what I had and the different avenues I went thru to ensure everything was correct. The result was I was not entitled to the refund, I should have owed the money, so my bill now with taxation was repayment of the refund plus the amount I actually owed. The final bill was 10,428.65. In speaking with a representative of H&R Block, I was informed that they will cover the interest 273.47 and will refund my payment of 144.62. I asked and requested any type of financial help and it was denied. Due to this error I had to take 10,000 out of an esp and so now my tax payable next year will be approximately an increase of 3500.00. Without this 10,000, my taxes would be approximately 1500.00. I have filed a report with better business bureau and it has just recently been forwarded to H&R Block district office. I am on approximately 24,000 yr pension and the total foreseeable cost to me is the 10,155.18 plus the approx. tax payable next yr of 3500.00. So sad that one cannot get the service requested and the final bill and the financial extension of the issue created is on the consumer's shoulders. I am still waiting for a decision from H&R Block as I write this article.
Put on wrong form, the preparer knew it. I told her I would wait because she told me that she didn't have the form 1099 misc. I ask why couldn't she download the form but she just talk me into doing the taxes on the 1040, said I needed to do them because IRS might come after me so I went on and done my taxes. THE TAXES was from 2007. I didn't do them until mid 2009 but she filed them for 2007 which that's why no one could figure out what happened. I signed for the money to be put on a card but I NEVER EVER GOT THE MONEY AS OF YET 2014. BUT SOMEONE DID BECAUSE WHEN THE OTHER PREPARER DONE THEM for the 3rd time, it showed up at IRS like I got the money. If you put it on a 1040 there is a box you check for mis. All I know is I keep getting MESSED OVER.
My boyfriend and I filed our taxes here for the 2012 and 2013 year. We received our refund on a card for 2012. When we filed for 2013, we had left the old card at home and the man told us he can put this refund on a separate card. Everything worked out fine. After we went home we called for the balance on each card a few weeks later (until we got a notification that our refund was in). The old card was a couple dollars and the new card had our refund. I took the new card and my boyfriend held on to the old card. We kept track of balances on both. A month ago I tried logging in and the website wouldn't let me. I had my boyfriend call them and they told us the cards were linked. Part of the reason I checked the balances when we got the new card was to make sure that they were or were not linked. When I came up with different balances I assumed that they were not linked. Now we want the $250 that was left on the card and they're saying that we spent it and we did not. We would not have left the money on the card if we knew that this would've happened. You're going to try to fix this with H&R Block but we will not be returning.
I went to HR Block to file 2013 last year at the Ponderay, Idaho office on Hwy 95. The agent didn't inform me that I was not required to file if I did not make at least 10,000. If I did, as a single taxpayer I would by law be required to file; however, I did not, so I was not required to file. He was going to charged me $150 anyway to file an income tax return that, BY LAW, I was not required to do so.
I had two 1099 to declare as an independent contractor and deductibles. Simple yet I was not sure I did it right on my own. H&R charged me $374 for 40 min and I ended up owing IRS instead of breaking even. How is that even legal to charge that much for the most simple tax return preparation. Outraged!!!!
My husband and I have had our takes completed by the Willow Lake Indianapolis Branch of H&R Block for three years since we moved here (2011, 2012 and 2013). We were audited for 2011 by the state of Ohio and I set an appointment with the branch immediately when I received notification. We owed almost $3k dollars to the state because we filed incorrectly. H&R block was looking into and getting back to me. Weeks went by with me calling the manager of the branch and she was looking into and going to get back to me. Finally after hunting her down and not getting any return texts or phone calls she answered one day and said "oh yeah, I got your messages." H&R block admitted they had filed our taxes incorrectly and did reimburse us for the fee of the charges we paid for their time filing the Ohio portion of our taxes in 2011 and the interest we were charged by the Ohio. However, we signed a Peace of Mind Contract that would cover the remainder of the fees, but mysteriously they cannot find a copy of the contract and somehow forgot to put it in my copy of materials. I have been in contact with the Branch Manager Pat, the District Manager Tom ** (who has never returned my phone calls. He called me a month later and said he would get back to me in a few days and never did. He told me he would be in a meeting for a week but was working hard to get resolution and would get back to me.) I emailed him two weeks later and got a message saying he was on holiday for a week. I also spoke with the District General Manager, Deanna **. She sent me an email asking me to call her (she didn't call me.) I called her over five times before I got a return call two weeks later. She said she wasn't familiar with my case - although she emailed me - and needed to look into and Tom ** would get back to me. Point is two months have gone by and I just wanted a copy of a contract I signed saying I either accepted or decline the Peace of Mind agreement. H&R Block claims I denied it although I purchased it all the other years but either way they cannot seem to locate the contract. I would have had a lot more patience and understanding if anyone would have called me back or followed through on their word. I did call customer service and file a complaint (which does nothing). After calling and working with three different people and not getting any follow up I was finally assigned to Gwen, who in all fairness did keep her word and call me back when she said she would and she is the only person who was able to get Deanna or Tom to call me. However, no matter how great Gwen is I am still in limbo waiting on a copy of my contract.
William **, agent of H&R Block Hicksville office who withheld our 2012 New York City tax and forgot to e-file it resulting $2253.36 penalty. We emailed him several times and William still claim he did file it. We went to Hicksville office to speak to the branch manager, she refer us to a Senior agent - Harry **, to help us. Harry researched into their computer system and confirmed that William did NOT e-file our local tax and don't understand why! Harry said that H&R will have to pay for the penalty, Harry told us to pay for it now so it won't keep on growing and told us to contact William. After several try after that, William is still deny that he did file it! All of the above are email evidenced. We have emailed William several times that we don't see NYC ACH of tax deduction in our bank account to alert him and he claimed he filed it, outright lying to us as evidenced in his email and confirmed by his branch office that he did NOT file it. Frustrated, we called H&R Block Consumer Service on October 4 and agent message the branch manager to call us and filed a CASE with Corporate to follow up! 3 days passed, we still have not received any calls from neither party! We got another letter from New York City of another $316 penalty. Unbelievable!
I had an awful services at H&R. First of all, I made an appointment and when I arrive nobody could help me because it was my first time doing taxes, even when I specify that by phone. I had to made a new appointment, which H&R call there to all their other branches and made it for me in a far place another day. Another day, far away from home, I arrive only to wait for a long time - finally to learn that AGAIN they couldn't help me because it was my FIRST time doing taxes... They manage to get me someone, who misspelled my name and fill the forms wrong. Canada revenue contact me for how much I made annually in 2012. They couldn't send any check because they were missing information. I call H&R. They told me to call Canada Revenue... BIG HELP! I end up sending a letter with that information and I have just received a cheque with my money one week ago (September). The person who help me in H&R told me he filled a form for me to have a direct deposit to the bank... so, yeah, I'm filling that up and sending it this week. He also wrongly fill the form that I attended school for half time. I told him to change that in time. I was a full time student, just because I notice, but I'm sure there is plenty things wrong with my taxes. Also, he promised a form that I will fill in and get my money from Medical Services Plan, but then realized next week that he made a mistake and that I didn't apply for getting my money back, because I was not a resident. I pay for a service and I'm still trying to solve what H&R miss to do what I pay them to 6 months ago! I'm really disappointed in the service and will expect at least a double check in my forms again with another agent and some money compensation for the waste of time they have created. I work full time and shouldn't be taking time off for handling what they did wrong. Seeing other people comments, I doubt it. NEVER GO HERE.
I was audited by the IRS last year. I had done my taxes on-line with HR Block. Only to find out that their software had calculated my vehicle depreciation, not at the 20% it was supposed to, but closer to 70%. It was so evident to the IRS agent that he waived all fees and interest and told me to contact HR Block. I called, faxed all paperwork, and got pushed around. After 6 months of trying, and it not being resolved, I let it go. They cost me $1700 by that error. DON'T USE HR BLOCK!!! USE ANYONE ELSE!!!!
We had our taxes prepared by H&R Block in 2012. We already paid the IRS $2,200 and recently received another letter from the IRS that we owe another $2,200 on top of the previous one we already paid. Now, we get the run around from your agent by the way in another store and location. Can't find the person who prepared the taxes, and we've been waiting two weeks now for one of your idiots an answer on what you are going to do for us? And as usual your crappy company does nothing. First we had someone else look these over and they filed this claim WRONG. My husband is not self employed dumb ass, We had all the W'2 in the folder and your fly by night operation shows it. My question is where's your policy that you are to pay this as it was YOUR MISTAKE? I'm sure you'll come up with some answer that fits to your company and STICK IT TO US. I can't wait until tax season. I'm taking out a full page ad for the public NOT to go to your driftwood operation. Because that's what H&R Block is here today and gone tomorrow.
I just had my taxes filed late with H and R Block in Warrington PA. The man seemed very unfamiliar with the software. My entire income was 3,500. I owed the IRS over 300.00 and H and R Block charged me 292.00 to file because of a special form required. I told them the year prior I made more money, and paid less taxes. I left with almost six hundred less dollars which I can't afford. I really believe they should be investigated by the BBB for unlawful business practices. I had an awful experience!
I had the Dodge City H&R file my taxes for 2011. The IRS did an audit on my taxes. I gave the Dodge City office the paperwork they asked for. That was in the summer. I received my tax refund, then they audit me again the beginning of fall. I called the tax office, thought they were taking care of it, I got another letter from the IRS in Dec. I called the Dodge City office, and it had gotten buried and was never taken care of. It has been a mess, The IRS wouldn't even deal with H&R Block. By time it was all said and done, now I owe over $4,000 in penalties and fines. I am angry. I paid them to take care of the audits, they did not. They filed my taxes wrong to begin with, as head of household. I am upset. I need help getting out of this mess and can't even afford an attorney.
I did my taxes with H&R BLOCK in Canada, Cochrane. The lady who did my taxes (Julie) promised me around 2000 CAD, I got approx 400 CAD. When I called H&R and asked about it, she blamed me that I didn't tell her something. I told them everything! She said she will fix it - that never happened. After 3 weeks I asked them again about my taxes and she told me to call CRA by myself. CRA explained me that H&R Block made an error and I should try to get my money back what I paid to do my taxes. I asked H&R if they are still representing me (wonder if they ever did). She blamed me again and didn't return the money. She said that I wasn't sure about my plans when I came to their office, which is totally untrue. I told her clearly about all my plans! They didn't admit their mistake and they are not representing me. I am figuring everything out about my taxes by myself... not a good service!!!
I have done all procedure for my tax return in one of your branch in Lowell, MA on 01/23/2014. My husband does not have social security because he is on H4 visa. Your staff did not perform their duty properly; and they are still wasting our time.
I have use H&R Block for the past 7 years and never had a problem until 2013. I received a Bill from the State of Virginia. My H&R Block Software generated taxes that have me receiving a refund. I went to a local H&R Block store and asked about the differences. The response was each state is different and it is difficult for H&R Block to keep up with the differences. My response to that is why not put a disclaimer on the State taxes and give me the State for free. The lady's response was that is why I need to come to the brick and mortar and let them do my taxes for me. Is H&R Block purposefully not keeping up with the individual states to drive loyal software customers to their brick and mortar stores? Why is the SW used by the store not the same I pay for and use at home? I am losing confidence in H&R Block. They do not appear to have the capability for quality control in their forms. If my state is incorrect, is my federal incorrect as well and the IRS did not catch it? A good representative of H&R Block would have attempted to retain me as a loyal customer and used their expertise to find out why the state denied credits that federal allowed and maybe argue my case for me.
H&R Block office Youree Drive Shreveport - I tried to file online, and I needed help. I was somewhat greeted at the door by a creepy little man who made me feel as though I was invading his space! He said that they had no access to the online H&R website, no smiles, no help. Honestly, he was menacing! I felt nervous and he made me feel so stupid! I went to a computer expert friend and she helped me. I will never use H&R ever again!
HR BLOCK prepared my 2012 tax return charging me $300. I paid the IRS over $1000. HR BLOCK had ALL information needed to prepare my return. Pertinent info was left out of my return. I now owe an additional $3100! HR BLOCK will not stand by their work/their error! DISGUSTED, NEVER AGAIN!
It is over three months since I filed my taxes and have not received a return as of today. This was for my 2010 taxes. (I couldn't afford to have my taxes done until this year.) H&R Block made mistakes on my state returns (2 states involved) and I cannot receive my refunds until the mistakes are corrected. I can't reach the preparer now (he won't return my calls or e-mails), so I called the main office for help and instead was given the Dept. of Revenue phone numbers for those states. I paid H&R Block to do them; why do I have to do their job?!?! Also, I gave them my 2011 & 2012 returns before the deadline to do and to this day they haven't been completed. They're asking for more money, but the returns aren't ready three months after I submitted the paperwork... I will NOT use this company again. They're way overpriced and the quality of their services has greatly declined. :(
I have been using HR Block for several years and have not had a bad experience in their offices yet. My problem is their non-existent fraud department. I opened two fraud cases with them and both cases were denied. I even sent video proving that I was not in the location at the time the transactions occurred. But all the customer service people say is, "We don't have any notes on your case." The fraud department, once they deny your case, doesn't even have to look at any evidence you have. There is no number to contact the fraud department. Oh and even better I had a supervisor tell me he didn't even know where they were located. REALLY NOW?! I don't get how you can operate a fraud department without oversight. They just sit up and twiddle their thumbs and stamp denied on your claim without any proof. I know they didn't contact either location because I spoke with them and got the videos. So how is it they did a full investigation? The customer service people don't know what the full investigation details are. They can't tell you what evidence they looked at, or what information they would need from me. Well the joke is on them. I'm not going anywhere. I want my money and I'm gonna get it.
I had my taxes to H&R Block in plenty of time to get them done before April 15th. I contacted them after the 15th because I didn't hear anything from them and I was told they filed an extension. They didn't complete them until a month later at which point there were penalties. I received a bill from the IRS today for $272.56 which I would not have to pay if they had completed my return in a timely manner.
H&R block is not on your side if an amendment by State or Federal comes your way and you wish to use Peace of Mind. If you have issues, the 1-800 will direct you back to the rep you are having an issue with to assist you. Then they will forward your case on to the Escalation department that is not on your side. The whole system is set up to drag things along and frustrate you. They are not on your side. Even though it is called the escalation department they are still H&R block and do not have your best interest. Whatever you do not get Ryan as your case manager. Comes off as nice but really against you. Peace of Mind is like their insurance product so they want you to pay for it but will fight when claims hit. You will eventually have a tax issue. Save yourself the trouble and got to another preparer.
H&R Block failed to complete my e-file for 2012. I was unaware of this until I received a notice from the IRS that my taxes were not filed for that year. After several calls and they finally took responsibility. I was assured they would cover all penalties, just bring it in and we will reimburse you. This has been going on for 2 months, not only have they not reimbursed me, they insisted I sign a letter to help reduce the fees, which in turn will take yet another few months for a response. I have had enough, and am not only disgusted, but ready to seek legal help!
Don't File your with H&R Block - This people will screw up your tax return. Then forget the Famous peace of Mind they offer you. We are still waiting for our tax return since February and still don't have it. Then they send me collection letters to collect their FEES!!!!! They left my husband occupation which was DISABLE next to my signature, and my SS number mixed up with his birthday. And Finally when I went to the H&R Offices to ask for help, they told me that I need to hand deliver my taxes in the IRS Austin offices. The only thing good there was the Manager. The rest of the staff... Buuuuuuu!!!
I have been waiting for over a year for the refund on this. Their register would not permit me to check out without adding on this fee. I was assured a refund for this $35 would be in my hands within 2 weeks. It's now 14 months. Repeated calls to corporate offices, local office visits and calls have yielded no results. Shame on you JoJo and H&R for outright lies!
I have gone to H&R Block in different states for over 8 years now and never had a bad experience. I moved to Newtown, Pennsylvania and attempted to file our taxes in that branch. The H&R Block tax representative did not know how to do his job and eventually we had to go to the Lahaska H&R Block branch. At that branch the H&R Block representative assisting me said the Newtown, PA rep was negligent and non-competent in his duties to file our taxes. I went round and round with H&R Block customer service, opening 2 cases. In the end I was told, a customer of 8 years, that no refund will be issued and that the tax rep in Newtown was talked to. Be aware; if you go to the Newtown, PA office - this H&R Block tax representative still works there. I now have a tax collection notice for my local taxes - interesting to know if the Lahaska rep did his job now too. H&R Block - HORRIBLE!!!!
Me too had a very bad experience after filing tax using H&R Block. Also my friends faced the same kind issues after filing tax return. The surprising thing is after the tax filing period, then closed their branch and it seems like they are not operating. Nobody has the responsibility to follow up on what happened after filing the tax. I am very, very disappointed.
I have used H&R block for several years. Each year they have become more expensive but because I used them frequently, I have paid the cost. For the past 2 years, I have also paid for the peace of mind insurance. H&R Block promises if there is an audit or any issue with your taxes, they will handle it. I received a notice from the IRS about a deduction that I had on my 2012 return ($1467.00) that I am going to have to pay by 5/14. When I tried to contact my tax prepare person, she was not available since the office is a seasonal satellite. I then contacted an office that is open all year round. I was told I would have to call and verify any information that the IRS was questioning. I have paid for peace of mind, insurance and tax prep but they do not deliver. When taxes are being prepared, most of the so-called experts ask questions that are leading and they give the client estimations to add in the numbers. They know they are not honest and now even with insurance and a payment of over $300.00 to H&R Block, I am going to have to pay the moneys since I could not get the information the IRS was questioning. I believe that H&R block should pay for their error. They took money from me and did not do anything when the IRS has questions about the information they put in my taxes. I feel H&R Block should refund the peace of mind and tax prep money they took from me since they did nothing and I will end up paying. I am officially done with H&R Block.
I decided to pay the extra $25 for a tax professional to review my return. That was a huge mistake. It took several days to get the return properly reviewed and updated. The tax professional first reviewed my form to file for extension, which had already been e-filed, instead of the return itself. It usually takes 24 hours to get a response back. For several days, I could no longer see my return, I was only able to view the extension form. Once the tax pro finally reviewed my actual return, he provided a note that there was a missing entry, which increased what I owned at an additional small amount - there was no explanation what that entry was. I did ask about it but never got the response. I found that working with a tax professional caused significant delays, made the process of filing the return much more time consuming and confusing and I do not believe the tax professional service offers any real value, on the contrary it cost me time and frustration. Further, while filing the return, navigating to each individual form/area was not possible without having to click next through a large number of screens every time I needed to go to a certain point, especially in the business expenses sections. These would be the main reasons why I will not use HR Block in the future and would advise others to stay away from it.
I had my taxes done 2-9-14, my birthday. The tax preparer told me he would not do my homestead because "I don't want to and I don't like to do them". That is part of their job!! I filed a complaint with the BBB and they refused to refund any of my money even though I did not get my full service. They said I had to come back to them and they will do the service. They should have done it right in the first place. I will never use them again. But they don't care about losing one customer. This was in Fond Du Lac, WI.
I was divorced from my husband in 2014. In a community property state if a couple lives together any time during the tax year, the entire year is counted and joint income and must be claimed 50/50. The lady figured both ways for me married filing separate or married filing jointly. She did not include the 50% of my ex husband's income on my form. This is a GROSS error, subjecting me to an audit. I happened to notice before I mailed the form. I tried to notify her and no response. So two days later stopped payment for a $489 dollar check which included $72 "peace of mind." HUH? She was furious and sent me a threatening mail about turning me in to the DA for a criminal act. Stopping payment on a check is not a criminal act. And even before the nasty letter, I sent her back $300 for her time just to be fair. I, so say, have 10 days before she turns me in. I am 63 yrs old and a bit more intelligent than that. She could have been nice and called me back in to work things out. I guess because she used to be a parole officer, she thinks she can sling threats around. My bank has all of the documentation of how this came down. So, I'll be happy to meet her at the DA's Office.
I've been to a few H&R franchises over the years and each one is completely different. Most of all, the communications standards are severely lacking. The franchise that I used this year, was the worst: They never told me that they needed to file an extension, did not tell me if I was getting a refund or needed to pay for a few weeks after that and worst of all... never responded to emails and calls asking them for updates. This was a franchise on 30th Ave in Astoria (Queens), NY.
My wife and I recently moved to California from different states and decided to go to H&R Block for professional tax prep. We chose Maureen ** based on all the rave reviews she got on Yelp. It was a singularly unpleasant and unprofessional experience every step of the way. Maureen did not have a NY state license to process my return from before I moved to CA. A detail she chose to leave out for a good week and half after taking our case. When we checked in to see progress on the file, she casually informed us that she still needed to renew her license. From there onward at every point in time, her evaluation of our Federal and State tax liability was full of inconsistencies. The numbers she quoted at every point were different from those mentioned on previous communications. If asked, she said, "That is what the HR Block tax software system says." She seemed unclear about what could and could not be deducted from our returns or whether we should file MFS or MFJ, which coming from a supposed "tax expert" is severely alarming. Keying in the numbers into a tax software black box is essentially a clerical job; one would expect more from a paid tax consultant. At the end of several phone calls and return visits, once our tax prep was finally final, she presented us a tax prep fees of $1,000. We were shocked at the number and expressed our dissatisfaction. This was followed by some extremely unprofessional communication from Maureen insinuating that although we made a lot of money, we didn't seem to have any (we did, it must be noted, pay the fees and have H&R file our taxes). In Maureen's mind, having a lot of money presumably equates to complete disregard for fees (and fees for bad service to boot). My husband and I are stunned that a professional and reputable company like H&R Block would hire a woman who feels it is okay to email a client in this manner. We want this not to go unnoticed. To that end, we want to include an excerpt of her email to us - verbatim. "I do understand that you are frustrated that you make a very commendable salary, but seem to have no money. You may want to go to a Consumer Credit Service (find one online that does NOT charge fees) to find help. I can recommend going to the public library and asking the librarian for help in living frugally. Also, there are many websites on budgeting, saving money, living frugally, etc. that are worth studying." Frankly, we never asked the aforementioned "tax expert" for "frugality" advice and will never be going back to H&R Block with our tax papers again.
I went in the first time to ask simple questions because it was my first time getting my taxes done by H&R because I was filing taxes for my business for the first time. When I sat down with a lady, I asked her a few questions that I had and one of the question was how much it would cost me to get my taxes done. She told me $120. I was a bit surprised and thought it was expensive and then she told me, "Depending on what you bring in, I can make you a deal." A few mins later I told her I would be back another day when I had everything I needed to get my taxes done. A couple days after I called her and she told me she had to leave at noon that day for emergency reasons so she then asked me if I wanted my file given to another tax preparer. I asked her if she minded. I ask her if she received commission and she said yes. I then said to her that it's okay then I didn't wanna take that away from her since she was very helpful, so I thought. I then asked her if she able to see me now before she left the office and she told me, "Yes, if you come in now, I'll be able to see you." 15 minutes later, I get at the office and I come face to face with her and she was leaving. She then told me, "I'm sorry, I have to go but I'll have someone else look at your file with you." She brought me in the office to see another lady. She sat with me and I gave her all my papers I had which they were very organized. She didn't need to calculate anything because I had already done it. She only had to enter numbers in. All said and done and she tells me that my fee for getting my taxes done was $235. I was shocked! I explained to her what I was told and she told me I had to wait for the boss in order to adjust the fee. They did. My taxes were filed and a couple weeks later I receive a letter from CRA asking me for proof of supports I had made for spousal and other documents to support my taxes filed. I then realized H&R made a mistake when filing my taxes because I don't pay spousal; I receive it from my ex. I called the lady to explain to her she had made a mistake and she told me she would look into it and she would call me back. She calls me back and tells me, "I didn't make a mistake. Everything is good." I was confused because I don't pay spousal support; I receive it. I thought okay maybe she's right but I then looked at the letter more closely and I knew she made a mistake. Why would CRA ask me for proof for payments I made if I receive payments??? I called her back and she told me, "They're just auditing you," and not to worry about it. I read to her the letter and she reassured me that she didn't make a mistake. I wasn't satisfied with that so I had to look at my summary given by them of my taxes and it was clear to me she had definitely made a mistake. She put in my spousal support I received under allowable deduction under my income. I then called her back a third time and insisted in telling her that she had made a mistake and to have someone else look at it. She called me the next day and said to me, "You're right. I did make a mistake." She corrected my taxes and my return was reduced by $1500 which I had to pay back. I thought they guaranteed their mistake??? Only penalties and fees I was told. The boss of H&R told me they couldn't give me back my fee because they had already given me a discount for a mistake they made. I'm not impressed with H&R at all and I'm not going back and will not recommend it to anyone!
I am a fellow employee of H&R Block and am very disappointed on how they've handled a so-called benefit called "free tax prep." H&R Block employees/associates were invited to support their local branch by having our tax returns done for free. On March 7th, to my surprise, I noticed a deduction for "tax prep" on my wage statement. Apparently, they racked up fees for a 1040, schedule C, EIC, and SE forms were added to my taxable gross income. Also, to add insult to injury, the tax representative was using my tax return to help exceed sales goal of $1100 (last year's sales total for that day) for that Sunday afternoon. The coupon didn't mention that the tax fee would be counted as a bonus and H&R Block stated that they would cover the cost of this service. However, there is an asterisk at the bottom of the page that says, "Each associate will be responsible for the taxation of the benefit." There was no explanation of what this meant let alone that the benefit would be deducted from my paycheck. I feel duped! The cost of my tax return was $543.50. I was taxed 25% on the Federal, 1.45% Medicare, and 4.2% on the SSI. Based on these deductions, I lost almost half my paycheck. This was an inconvenience to me and my family. I'm barely making a little over minimum wage. I called Human Resources in Kansas City to see what can be done about my paycheck. Then I was told there was nothing they can do. They further advised me to speak with my district manager or office manager. I sent the district manager an email and her reply was: "Hello Debbie, please talk to your manager to get this resolved." When I went back to my office manager, he said I should file another business income next year to get my money back from the IRS. I am not HAPPY! Block's representatives keep blowing me off hoping I will go away. Furthermore, I keep asking for an itemized list of the fees so that I could know exactly what they charged me for. This too is vanity. It seems to fall on deaf ears. No one wants to get involved. Also, H&R Block doesn't tax clients who pay by credit card or cash for their tax preparation. Why should it be different for employees who use the coupon? Would it make a difference if I cashed my payroll check and then paid for my tax return? Oh, I forgot, Block wouldn't want that. They figured we wouldn't pay that much for a tax return. This wasn't a benefit! It was a scam!!! H&R Block didn't uphold their promise to "cover the cost of this benefit." It wasn't for free as the coupon and internal website suggested. I AM NOT HAPPY!!!
I believe I was hacked with H and R Block. I have been under a fraudulent claim with them the past 3 weeks because when I tried to use my card it was declined. When I called them and told them I was having problems with my card, the lady told me that it was because I had ordered another card. I informed her I had not ordered another card. So she put me to the fraud department and they told me that my funds was used in Florida. I told them I never order another card nor have I been to Florida this year. So after writing the fraud department disputing the charges I had to wait 21 days before I could get any answer. During the time I called H and R to make sure they received my letter of me stating that all the Florida charges was fraudulent. One of the customer service reps told me it looks like my account had been corrupted since last year when Target and a few other stores had been hacked. She asked me didn't I get a voicemail with it telling me of the situation and to get a hold of H and R Block. I told her I never got a voice message or an email. She let me know they only did voice messages which I never received. When I did hear from them, they denied my claim! Saying they found nothing fraudulent and the case would be closed. So now I'm pressing charges. I have let H and R do my taxes the past ten years and the security with this unforgivable. I'm a single parent, two kids. I save my money and for the lack of security that has been Done, I'm very hurt. I have contacted BBB to try and get any help and assistance with this matter. I don't think I'm only one too. Please help.
I have used the same CPA for over 30 years for tax return preparation. I recently retired, moved, and decided to use the local H&R Block for my 2013 Tax Return. Although the return is straightforward and not complicated, the individual doing the preparation had to seek out advice of his associate. Additionally, the lack of a copier in the office was inconvenient. The cost of the preparation, inclusive of insurance if the IRS challenged the return, was over $500, higher than I anticipated. A few days ago, I received a letter from the IRS indicating that the return was incomplete and additional forms and information was required. I called the H&R Block office, but could not reach anyone or leave a message. I attempted to call H&R Block Corporate, Consumer Affairs, and Consumer Support, but they are not reachable. I learned from another store front location that many of their offices, including the one I used, close after April 15th, and if I wanted to travel 35 miles, I could set up an appointment. H&R Block is totally unprofessional and irresponsible in terms of tax return preparation, dealing with clients and accessibility.
I phoned to determine the service and fee. H&R said they file only and would not just review. I dropped by, and with little delay was sitting with a tax preparer. The service was very efficient. They inserted the numbers accurately, then bullied me into e-filing after clearly stating I wanted to mail the return with a letter about extenuating circumstances. In hindsight, I should have paid the bill and walked away and continued to use my U-file software, as the difference was minor. I had to coach the preparer what to include and why we should include income splitting with my spouse. So as a number enterer, they are great, but their knowledge to help reduce tax is very poor. The bill was almost $500, which is about twice they estimated before I sat down. I recommend everyone to buy the software or use online software and do their own filing, as it is easier and you can do much better.
Completely happy with the tax preparation and the stressed out and frazzled representative who processed our return. We've used H and R Block to prepare our taxes for the last ten years and unfortunately, it appears this year was the last. When my husband and I came into the office this year to sign returns and pay for the service, I was absolutely floored when the receptionist tells me the bill for preparing our returns is $450! I was so shocked, I asked her to repeat the amount several times. Last year's tax returns processing amounted to just over $300 - and I thought that was outrageous at the time. I told the young receptionist to please relay my complaint to the site manager who would hopefully share our unhappiness with executives further up the line. I will not bring my business to H and R Block next year because they felt it perfectly acceptable to play the price gouging game with loyal customers and I feel betrayed by the company.
Professional, clean, friendly. Mary ** was superb! Experienced, caring, efficient, FULL OF INTEGRITY, and friendly. Saved about $150 on tax prep fee by driving from Liberty Tax office to H&R Block. I will be back next year. THANK YOU.
This is the worst experience I have ever had with a business. I went to H&R Block because I needed expert help. I did not get it; I had to tell the "expert" that she had prepared my taxes incorrectly and explain how to fix it. Now because (my mistake) I paid them instead of just walking out. I have paid almost $400 to do my own taxes. When I called the local manager to complain I never heard back. I filed a complaint and they told me that unless I can prove that they have been done wrong (yay, now I get to pay someone else to do them too!), they will not refund any money. Well here's the problem. If they were done correctly it's because I had to tell my expert what to do. I literally had to tell her what line a deduction went on and that was the difference between me owing $1700 and me owing like $75. I feel like I got duped. This seems more like a scam than a honest business. I will never use them again and I would never recommend that anyone else go here either.
So I have a horrible story to tell. I made an appointment for my boyfriend to get his old taxes done at a local H&R Block I have been going to for years and paying money to them for years now. So we go in and Eric has a seat. Alexis (my very autistic daughter) has a seat next to him and I sit next to her. And my boys play behind me. And as we sit down Lexy coughs. Not all over the place nothing horrible. The tax person (whom by the way I have gone to many, many times) says: “Hey could you not have her cough in my face.” (Very rude I might add) First off even if he was sitting in a chair and my daughter standing. She couldn't even cough in his face (tall man anyways). And she did not cough in his face! Eric Instantly, you could see was very unhappy. I said: “What?” Tax person said again, “Could you not let her cough in my face. Or take her somewhere else.” He then looked at Eric ** and said, “Looks like you want to hurt me?” Eric still in shock, angry - just looking at the man. Tax person looks at me and says: “Something wrong?” Let me point out how unbelievably rude this person was. Second she didn't even cough in his face. I said “Yes, she didn't cough in your face. She is autistic for one. She just coughed down. She did not do anything wrong. You’re rude. You’re unprofessional and in the wrong. What am I supposed to just tell her not to cough. She will not understand what I'm saying. And most importantly, she did not cough in your face.” Tax person said: “You want to see someone else.” Eric said yes. He gets someone to make a complaint. The woman he got, also rude, I couldn't believe what was going on! So upset I had a panic attack. I had to go to the doctor. I called H&R Block headquarters, explained what happened. The person on the phone, very understanding and kind, couldn't believe what I had told him. So I hope someone takes care of this very serious problem. By the way, if my daughters is not welcome there, then either am I! Don't ever tell me to take her somewhere else. She stands next to me always. And if my autistic daughter is not good enough for you H&R Block, then either is my money! Let’s see if anything really happens after my complaint. They care more about their employees treating their clients poorly. Then I will never be going back!
Wow, I wish I would have looked for reviews before going to H&R Block!! I waited until the last minute this year and after struggling through TurboTax (due to a partnership in a rental property last year), I decided I'd go to a "professional" at a local H&R Block office. This was the first time I hadn't used TurboTax but figured it was worth a couple hundred dollars (figured it would be about $200) to make sure everything was entered properly. I set up appointment #1 for Sunday 4/13... I am single, rent an apartment, part time grad student - student loans/tuition, partial owner in a rental property, have an HSA... all of my tax forms were in a nice neat pile for the woman I was meeting with; couldn't be that hard... I was immediately told they couldn't do the K-1 for the rental property (the only reason I came to them) but then after she spoke with a co-worker for several minutes, it was decided that they could - billable time to converse with co-workers?? We went through everything within an hour but due to a potential error on my W2, I had to go back the following day. Day 2 - Monday 4/14. I returned with a correction to my W2. No other adjustments needed to be made to the tax prep as she omitted the incorrect info anyway. She quickly reviewed my return... I noticed she didn't include the 2nd certificate of rent paid so she made adjustments. She flew through everything else, barely asked me any questions or to verify accuracy (figured this was how they worked?). She marked "yes" for me claiming HOPE/American Opportunity Education Credit within the past 2 years. I have always claimed the lifelong learning credit. When I questioned this, she said it didn't matter?? After reviewing my paperwork later, she claimed the lifelong learning credit for me in 2013 as well. So okay... The refund total came to about what it was showing in TurboTax at the time I got stuck so figured everything was entered correctly. Day 2 was about a 30-minute visit by the time she provided me copies of the paperwork, etc. Then came the fee conversation... $370. WHOA. This was double the amount I was expecting to pay. At that point I seriously contemplated saying no way and heading back home to try TurboTax again. With the deadline quickly approaching I figured it was better to just get it done. She then asked if I wanted to take the fee from my return... sure. After entering all of my direct deposit info, she then tells me it will be an additional $55 to take the fee from my return... Where was that information up front? I told her I would rather just pay then and save some $. She was irritated, gives me a very annoyed look and asks, "You're really going to make me go back in here and redo this?" YES, I am. I wasn't informed of additional fees when I agreed to that the first time! She then looks at my total and asks if I want to 'omit' reporting the amount paid from my HSA which would save me $30. I asked her to confirm that this was something that should be reported on taxes (my first year with an HSA). Her response was that if I was asked and the IRS found out that I omitted it, I would be charged for not reporting the amount. Um, if it needs to be reported and I just gave you the paperwork, YES please assume that I'd like to have it reported on my taxes. What kind of question was that?? After it was all said and done, I paid the ridiculous fee for tax preparation and then asked for a copy of the itemized receipt that showed all the charges leading up to this $370 total. Her response was an immediate "NO, we don't give out detailed receipts". WHAT?!? I just paid you $370 but you won't let me see what I'm paying for?? What kind of business is this?! At this point I was just shocked and irritated so left the store. After driving away a few blocks, I kept thinking more and got increasingly irritated for the lack of documentation for my latest $370 adventure with this company. I pulled my car over and called the store back to inquire if this was some kind of company policy. The woman who answered put me on hold and then the same woman who just prepared my taxes and refused to give me my receipt gets on the line. GREAT. I was again met with, "We don't give out detailed receipts." I asked a few more questions to see if it was company policy and what the reason behind this was. There was no credible answer, just that they "don't do that". Knowing I wasn't getting anywhere with this woman, I said okay and hung up the phone figuring I could file a complaint or question this on the company website. Other than the 800# there is no contact info, especially for reporting an issue or asking a question about their services... RED FLAG! So much for customer service. I then looked through the paperwork and noticed this tax specialist also used my electronic signature to sign me up for automated/pre-recorded messages from H&R Block. At the top of the form, it says "As explained by your tax professional..." Pretty sure my tax professional forgot to include me in this conversation before adding my signature to the document. Small annoyance but one of many questionable moments from this experience. So... my fault for waiting until the last minute and not doing my research beforehand. H&R Block's fault for overcharging on their services, not providing a receipt with details on these ridiculous charges, and questionable business practices by employees. NEVER AGAIN WILL I VISIT H&R BLOCK! Hopefully more people do their research and this review saves at least one person from making the same mistake.
H&R Block is a bunch of rip offs and liars... I went to Irvington, NJ branch where they all use scripts. I asked specifically; when will my return money be in!?? The rep Chiquita told me, within a week. Now, within a week means, in between 1-7 days. 7 days passed and she and her constituent then changed what they said to 7-14 days later and the old lady at desk said up to 21 days, where this time, they showed me a screen... I brought back to her attention the lie that was told to me and she and the rest of colleagues said, "Yea, they DID accept it within 7 days!" (This they said to try to clean up what was said not realizing I have it recorded)... I then told them and showed them what was said and all you see is guilt in the area room... not to mention, the rep knew I was on my way down and she then left prior to us speaking...another suspicion. It's April 14th and nothing is being said nor done... They said and I strongly quote, "Oh, the IRS let's us know what's going on with your tax refund when it's available and when they receive it!" But today, at 6:48 pm, I spoke to receptionist about this and she said (contradictively from what reps and mgr told me), "We cannot tell because IRS cannot and will not inform us about anything!"... H&R Block are a bunch of rip offs and not only am I suing for false advertisement but distress, malpractice and for additional other reasons... This experience only makes people not want to work on the books and just under table for everything since the government themselves allow this to happen!!! So what's to happen when us, the American people stop working on the books where the same crummy government takes taxes from us and causes us to struggle more?
I filed my taxes this year and paid peace of mind. Anyways did my taxes after 4 hours of listening to some lady talk about her damn kids instead of worrying about my taxes – Yes, I’m married, have 3 kids, got it lady! Anyways I’m in the military, I file my local taxes in PA even though I’m in LA. Anyways we have a form that was given to us from our local DFAs she said we need this form so we took it went to H&R and the lady says don’t need it. Mind you I have to do 3 w2s and local tax charged $450.00 and told had to wait 10 weeks longer to get our return back which still haven’t got it. Call the local district manager and she told us after she reviewed it etc. and calls my wife back and says “Hey, yes we messed up your local taxes. We are going to use your case to train our staff better.” Well ended up she tells my wife we are getting $150 back for the mistake. Ended up getting a few days later a $50 check and called all week and never got a return call back. Sent me $50 after I paid $450 to have my TAXES DONE RIGHT THE FIRST TIME. I serve my country to get screwed by a lady that lied and don’t answer phone calls nor return called the corporate office and they are investigating the case then have to wait 3 days before they figure out the issue I will get my $450 back. If anyone else has been audit and paid peace of mind, you should be entitled to what you paid for services and receive it back for their mistake not yours.
I had the great mispleasure of dealing with H&R Block. What scam artists. The guy doing my taxes refused to give me a fair estimate (required by state law) then afterwards told me the fee was 990.00. I never paid more than 300 anywhere. These morons don't realize I can make other copies or paperwork and get it done right elsewhere. They can keep my copies, roll 'em up in a nice big ball, and SHOVE them right up the dark side. DO NOT USE THESE ** EVER!!!
Waited nearly 45 minutes. My preparer spent too much time telling stories instead of getting on with the job. I am completely useless when I have to deal with tax forms. So that is why I have gone year after year to H&R Block. I used to go to a preparer Coral Gables, and I was very satisfied over several years. I will go back to him next year. However, the office I used is closer to my home. I had to wait nearly 45 minutes, even though I had an appointment. My preparer was extremely pleasant, however he seemed compelled to tell me stories about other clients, other things going on or that had gone on in his life. While I enjoyed chatting to him, I couldn't help wishing that he would just get on with the job. It could have been done in 20 minutes instead of over an hour. My circumstances had changed, to be fair, from last year, as I was laid off and had been taking freelance work. I had every single piece of paperwork needed. He didn't ask me many questions. I had to ask him, "is this something you can include in my return?" Several times, and he did include it. He told me twice, "This job is killing me." When we were done, I went to pay, and several of the tax preparers were sitting in the reception area where the receptionist takes payments, and he said to them, "She's going to fall over backwards when she sees how much she has to pay for this." Well, as my payment to the IRS was under $400, you can imagine that $519 to H&R Block was a pretty high fee to pay. Also, he did not ask me if I wanted their "Peace of Mind" additional charge. Their bill is not itemized so I don't know if I have it or not. I will not be using H&R Block's North Miami office again.
My wife and I have used H&R Block for many years and have been very satisfied with the professionalism and quality of service we received. This year was different. We arrived approximately 20 minutes before the appointment. Our surprise came when the person who was to prepare our taxes came into the office 2 minutes before the appointment. Shortly after the tax preparer got situated, by putting her items away and turning on her computer, we were escorted to the cubicle. This was well after the start of the appointment time. Upon seeing my forms identifying me as a retired serviceman and now working as an educator within our school district, the tax preparer stated, "I am a retired teacher." From this moment, the tax preparer seemed to focus more on their past than the task at hand. This caused the tax preparer to make a couple of errors. How do I know? The tax preparer admitted by saying, "We'll go back and fix it in a minute..." When the tax preparer was finished, I was told, "You owe $12,000 in taxes." Since the last of our three children left home, my wife and I have always known we would pay more taxes. Most of the time the payment owed ranged between $2-3,000. I politely asked the tax preparer to please look at it again. The tax preparer asked another tax preparer to come over and review the work prepared. This tax preparer pointed out two items: (1) the tax preparer added my earnings twice; & (2) use of the wrong format. At this point, we saw the amount of taxes owed go from $12,000 to $9,000 to $7,000. The second tax preparer seemed annoyed to have to come over and assist the co-worker. My wife and I were both disappointed by the lack of professionalism by both tax preparers and were resigned to pay the $7,000 amount. As we do each year, we purchased the Peace of Mind Extended contract. When we were leaving, the tax preparer said, "If you get called in (audited), don't call me!" I gave the tax preparer a stern look, to which the person must have known they made an error to make such a comment. The tax preparer then said, "What I mean to say is H&R Block will provide you with a tax consultant per the agreement." Several days later, we received a phone call from H&R Block, informing us of an error on their part. Instead of paying $7,000 in taxes, we would have to only pay $4,000. When I returned to sign amended copies to our 1040, I was met by a very professional and different tax preparer. The initial two tax preparers were also present. I was asked if we had sent our payment, and I told this new tax preparer we mailed a check for $7,000 to the US Treasury Dept two days after our taxes were prepared. While at H&R Block the second time, I received an immediate feeling of hostility from both of the tax preparers who were initially prepared our tax forms. Yet, I said nothing negative, nor committed any act to make them feel this way toward me. I was told by the new tax preparer to send the amended form by May 1, 2014. Sending it now would cause them (IRS) to look closely at you. I have nothing to hide. Although we are pleased someone reviewed our taxes again, we feel it should have been done right the first time. I have this feeling we may be audited, which doesn't sit well with me or my wife. I will continue to use H&R Block's services, but never will I have those two tax preparers prepare anything for us again.
So I made an appointment with H&R Block. We went and she started asking questions so I said, "How much is this going to cost?" She say about two hundred to two twenty five and it goes up with additional papers filed so we go through our stuff pretty straightforward. I asked about different ways of doing things and she was very short and her response was, "What do you want to do?" Well, I wanted to do whatever was best for us without red flags. We get through it and she says we owe three hundred and seventy dollars. I was mad. She says, "Well, you ask these questions," and with each question I guess I was charged (pissed). So I ask these questions; I ask which were normal questions, did you ask most of your clients these same questions. She says yes, so on an average, I would say the price is about three fifty SO THEY BAIT YOU AT TWO HUNDRED KNOWING IT'S OVER THREE BUT THEY'RE AFRAID YOU'LL WALK. VERY DISHONEST (SHAME).
I had the worst experience with H&R Block, the worst experience I've had with a business in a very long time. They filed my taxes in 2011. According to them, I owed $450 to state and $340 to the IRS. The IRS and the NY State reached out to them regarding errors in filing, and asked for them to refile for said year on my account. H&R Block never contacted me or alerted me to said misfile. Fast forward two year later - in fall of 2013, I receive a letter for the IRS. I was mid-move and lucky that I received the mail at all. The IRS said that I was due a refund as they had received a check for $340, but technically had no filing for me for 2011. I call H&R Block Customer Service and they quickly set me off to an appointment in-store. I get to said store and they cannot do anything to help me, to contact customer service as only they can handle the issue. I then go to the IRS office myself and only then do I find out that it was a misfile error on H&R Block's part. The IRS advises me to contact state as the error was probably on both ends. I contact NY State Tax, and lo and behold, they do not have a correct filing on record for my 2011 return. With this news, I call H&R Block Customer Service, who again tries to set me up with an in-store appointment... Sick of the Hollywood Shuffle, I ask them to file an E-claim for me regarding getting a refund of my prep fee from 2011. They said they can't issue refunds themselves but can put in a claim that will take 4-6 business weeks to process. 4... to 6 business weeks to process. For a mistake on their part, that they never notified me about. I would've lost $900 in mispayments to the government had I not received a letter from the IRS directly (there is a 3-year window to claim government refunds) - and no accountability to boot from the H&R Block team. Never, ever going back. Run. Run, as fast as you can. It turns out that H&R Block runs on a localized, commission-based system, so that practically anyone can secure a license and then do your taxes. Since the boroughs are local, H&R Block then takes no responsibility for refunds for errors in filing a consumer return, as there isn't a nationwide, systematic network for said errors. They have a "Peace of Mind" credit but the loophole for getting a refund that way is you must report documentation to them within 30 days of receiving any notification of an error - as opposed to the IRS' notification which says you have a window of 3 years. Appalling and unethical.
I filed February 21, 2014. I got it sent to my bank. Due to my mistake, it went to a closed account and returned to H&R Block. On the 6th they sent out a check to my address. I never received it. Two weeks later, I filed a client lost check so they would replace it. This being on the 28th of March. On March 31, they said they need a deposit slip and a letter directing them to deposit it and I would have it in two days - not. They then said they couldn't read the name on the bank info so I again went to my bank; had them to send it again. I called back. They then said they could not read the name on the cancelled check form. I went to the office again and had it fax from their office on the 8th of April. I called today. They try to tell me the bank officer didn't sign the deposit paper when she clearly did. Then it was back to they didn't have enough info to put it in my account, to call back in two hrs just so I have to talk to another idiot that can't read. They are holding my money for no reason. I have faxed everything they ask for. I am at my blowing point with these people. I want to file theft because they have already been paid for their services. They keep telling me it takes three to five days to send it to my bank when it only takes ten minutes to do it on computer and a check will take two to three weeks. Can anyone help me get the money I worked for?
Personal accountant vs H&R block - go to a personal accountant. I thought it would be cheaper and the same service but instead it took more time, cost more and I had to be much more involved to go to H&R block. I will never go back... In addition to the fee being the same for a far less service than a personal accountant the location I went to cannot even read/book appointments correctly. I booked an appointment for 8 pm, was called to confirm 8 pm - show up at 8 pm to be told my appointment was at 7 pm and looked at like I was the idiot. Awful experience, I now have valuable knowledge to not use H&R block because they charge a single filing individual $252 for 1.5 hours of their time. On the end screen it said I spent 4.6 hours there and that was completely false. I inquired if that affected the price and was told it did not. So $252 for 1.5 hours... I will never recommend to any friends or colleagues.
I just got a call to pick up and sign the paperwork for my taxes and was told I have to pay 380.00 for the preparation. I am in shock!!! I can't believe they told me it would be around 80.00 to 100.00. My taxes are not that complex!!! I can't pay the money so they are holding my taxes. My refund is 2.00. That is crap. They are rude and don't even offer tax advice that may help you in the future. I will never use them again.
Prices are not quoted accurately. Had the exact same forms used last year and my cost was over $100.00 higher! Last year's pricing was gouging! This year it's all out blatant robbery. $310.00 for simple taxes. That was with a $90.00 rebate!
I was the first scheduled morning appointment in the office that I visited. Even still, when I arrived, I had to wait an additional 15 minutes for the preparer to gather documents required for filing. When filing, these issues arose. STRIKE ONE: The preparer did not understand how to report my educational credits and asked me to return that afternoon for a second appointment (this should have been reason enough for me not to trust H&R Block - the expert wasn't at all an "expert"). STRIKE TWO: The filing fee, as a student, with no (what I perceived to be) complicated deductions was $295.00. STRIKE THREE: When I returned, the accountant was incredibly unprofessional and rude, stating that she had "others waiting" and hinted that I should rush through remaining paperwork. Mind you, she took all of *four* hours to get back to me/call me in for the afternoon follow-up appt. There are some decent offices out there, I'm sure, but this wasn't one of them. I am extremely disappointed with my first and only experience at H&R Block. It left a horrible taste in my mouth and I won't be soliciting their services again. Each and every employee should be trained in professionalism and be held accountable - they are, after all, representatives of a business *based in client relations*. And yes, one bad apple *does* spoil the bunch.
I commenced to work as a tax preparer in the Bronx at this company, in 2011. I started entry-level like everyone else. I once had a client that was unsatisfied with her refund for the amount of $1990.00. She was getting all she deserved on this federal refund and I explained to her why she had larger amount prior year. She adjourned by stating she was not going to pay the fee and not complete the filing. My co-worker, seven years, expertise, had just walked in and clocked in. She question the dismissal of the client, sat on my seat to revise and I told her to make sure she changes her Ptin number to hers if she decided to complete and submit anything. She replied, that she was just revising. Later, I find out she actually, alter with a fake schedule c to increase refund for the clients and submits to IRS and state with my name. I complained to district manager. We had a meeting, then my manager goes and does the same. She actually fixes a head of household refund for a male I told could not do so because he stated he was married, lived with his wife; she claimed her children as head of household and he was claiming his child as head of household. H&R Block claimed they will correct it. But these clients received checks under my name. I called IRS of which I am in good standing with and they suggested that I filed a 3439A and file complaints. I was terminated from my job being falsely accused of being dangerous to customers and clients, perhaps a conspiracy. I spoke to some clients. They denied that been truth and willing to say so. My manager was constantly telling and screaming and all she could say about Hoh filing was she had a family she loved and was never audit. I took the case to Ginarte in NJ. And they jiggle to finally say I had no case. But the IRS send a letter they will investigate.
I went to file my taxes at the Levittown, NY office and had an appointment scheduled with CATHERINE **. When I sat with her for a consultation she was very rude and told me that she didn't want to do my taxes as it would take too much work to do. I was shocked as I thought this was a reputable firm, I guess not. I would stay far away from this place. I left there and went to another franchise a mile away after I left and they completed my return in 45 minutes. I think they need to hire friendlier people or pay them more.
I just finished my taxes in person with a tax professional at H&R block, and was very surprised to find out that they were charging me $291.50! When I originally called to make the appointment I asked the person who answered the phone how much it would cost to have my taxes done in person versus dropping them off to be done. I was quoted a figure of $80-$100 total for state and federal filing as this year I could not do a 1040 EZ form because of some debt forgiveness and itemization income. After sitting there for almost an hour past my appointment time and then for 1.5 hours for the actual appointment and having done most of the legwork myself previous to the appointment to make sure I had everything organized I couldn't believe what I was charged. I was grossly misquoted, and when I questioned the fee the tax preparer said that they charge by form. She explained that she had to fill out long forms so that's why it was so expensive. I am very perplexed by this fee because other people whose taxes are much more complicated than my own pay their CPA's considerably less to do their taxes. I make less than $20,000/year, $291 is a large sum of money which I cannot even pay so they are holding my tax paperwork (including all of my W2's) until I can pay the exorbitant fee. Now I can't even have another tax preparer do my taxes for a lesser fee because I don't have any of the appropriate paperwork. H&R block should be ashamed of themselves! Furthermore I tried to give this feedback both online and by phone and could not find a place to report feedback and I couldn't even get a person on the phone, everything was automated. Clearly H&R Block does not truly care about customer service if they aren't even willing to have a place on their website to receive feedback or complaints. My positive piece of feedback is that my tax professional was exactly that she was professional and kind, she worked quickly and efficiently; unfortunately, the reason she was so late is because H&R block overbooked her (I could see her schedule clearly on her wall and was amazed that they didn't even schedule a lunch or bathroom break for her, she had clients back to back for 8+ hours). I am sure that only a small fraction of this $291.50 (that I will somehow eventually pay) will go to her and the rest will go towards paying people at H&R Block who do little to no work and probably get to take many bathroom and lunch break during the busy tax season.
I have been going to the same H&R Block for the last 5 years. The tax preparer I meet with is fine, always courteous. However, this year I was charged $287 for a simple return. The only thing I own is a small condo. That is the only additional piece over a simple tax filing. I made no improvement, can't afford to. Nothing unusual happened that required any amount of extra amount of paperwork. I live on a very limited income - I cannot afford to pick up my taxes because I don't have $287 at my disposal. I will never go back to H&R Block - Greedy, Greedy, Greedy. You should be ashamed charging such high fees for basically simple returns.
After I filed my taxes I realized from reviewing the pdf that entire sections of a form were missing from the CD. This meant that my file was incorrect and I will be reassessed. This will likely result in interest owing. When I spoke to an H&R block rep, I was told that the CD was likely defective and I should try the CD again. But once the file is submitted, you cannot resubmit until you receive the assessment statement. Do no use this software!
H&R Block Tax Software is crippled. This is the first year I filed my taxes Married Filing Separately. Since I had more withholding taken last year, I got a refund. My spouse was not going to be so fortunate so I chose to file hers closer to April 15. I found out that since we lived in a community property state, there is a form 8958 that needs to be included with our 1040. I did not panic. I just figured I would go back into the software, fill out the form and file hers with it, and file an amended return for myself. Easier said than done. There is no form 8958 in H&R Block tax software. So I got online and talked to Tax support who, after a twenty-minute wait, told me that form 8958 is not supported in their software (???). Because of their inept programming, I run the risk of getting my taxes done late, dealing with the IRS, and incurring penalties. I am at this moment trying to decide whether to use another company's software or just have this fixed by a tax pro. This is the last time I use H&R Block for anything.
Just took my 90 year old mother to get her taxes done, very simple taxes, got taken to cleaners for $288 on a taxable income of $15,000. It took him over an hour, hung the computer up, and had to ask for assistance, sure gave the impression of not being knowledgeable, just good at data input. When questioned about the charges the response was "Gee, I was surprised too." No response at all to our comments or concerns. A CPA would have charged less than H&R Block, one thing I learned is not to go to H&R Block to get your taxes done.
I went to H&R Block on Chemong Road in Peterborough, Ontario to get my taxes done. I own a rental property, and they charged me $266. Then I was told I owed the government $1,000. I was so sticker shocked I stupidly signed the waiver forms without double checking everything. When I got home a few hours later and reviewed the documents, it was $1,069 I owe (I think paying almost $300 means the rep should have been professional and told me what I owe, not rounded down). I also noticed that she spelled my street name wrong... and all in small letters. I now have to call the CRA to find out how to change the address on my file so they can find me, and I can pay them what I owe. I will never, ever go to H&R Block again and will tell all of my friends, family and work colleagues not to give them business. My rep was incompetent and soured me on the entire organization.
I just had my taxes prepared and I have been going to them for about 3 years now. The office was in the same store mall, but they opted for a smaller store front. Everyone was within elbow reach of each other and every client could hear the private "confidential" information about everyone else's business there. I did not appreciate that my financial information was being verbally shared with anyone within arm's reach. I had a return of $1,700 but after H&R explained what their form fees came to which was close to $700.00, there wasn't much left coming back to me. What H&R Block advertises with regards to putting money back into the customer's pocket actually seems to go into their pocket. With what they charge, I think that they could find more suitable office space for the clients to conduct their business. I did contact the H&R Block Complaint Escalation department, and they were unable to offer any satisfaction. The typical answer I was receiving was that I should have just walked out if I didn't like the the fee. Really? That is the best they can offer? I feel that their prices are very inflated and they did not resolve the issue. I will not be returning next year to have my tax return go to H&R Block.
When I started doing my income tax I was unsure if I had everything right (I did) so I went to see an H&R Block office in LA where I live. I explained my tax information which I brought and that I needed someone to essentially verify my work. I have used this company in the past just not here and was satisfied. When I did my taxes I was getting over $500 back. After they did it (and coming up with the same number) they charged me $236 for less than an hour’s time there. I was never given an estimate although when I called their "corporate" office I was told that I was. While each office is distinct I would caution using the one listed below: H&R Block, 4929 Wilshire Blvd, Suite 101, Los Angeles, CA 90010. Phone: 323-634-9204
I was trying to file my 2013 taxes and it was rejected because of the wrong 2012 AGI number. Well, they had me call the IRS for a pin and the IRS does not give pins out. Well H&R Block does not let you fix the file return without the pin. I was on the phone for an hour trying to get the info I needed. The representatives were uneducated and were handing out the wrong info. I spent over a month trying to file my taxes. My advice is don't even go through H&R Block. COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I was offered by the representative when I called to have a FREE review done of my current and previous three years of tax returns. At the scheduled appointment, the FREE review was confirmed and I was told it would be completed in a couple of days. After repeated calls and broken promises for a month, I was then called and told the manager wanted to charge me for the review and I told the agent that I do not want them to review my returns and I will just come and pick up my documents. I was then told she wanted to talk to her manager and just complete one year's review for free since that is what I was promised and would call me back. Messages were left and a week later, I was told that one year's taxes were reviewed and there was a charge! And that NO documents were leaving this office without the fee paid! I went to the office and was told my documents were not going to be released without signing a document stating they completed a review of my taxes. I told them I did not want their review and would not sign the document. The manager (Jill **) came up front insisting on the signing and I had to threaten requesting the police to come over in order to get my documents!
I recently had my Identity stolen... I recently last month on February 8th after receiving my last W2 went to H&R Block in person located at Hillcroft and Richmond Ave. in Houston, Texas. When the tax preparer entered in my information a screen popped up, her question was "did you start this online?" My response "NO" instead of clicking yes so she could review it. She clicked no and it cleared out of their system. She processed my information and e-filed it. It came back as already filed... What a nightmare. Two days later after filing a police report on the 10th, I received a phone call from H&R Block reject center telling me my return was accepted, a few errors were found but it was corrected and it will be in my account in 21 days. I told her, "Ma'am, that's impossible. My identity was stolen and my paperwork is still at the office waiting for me to go to the office on Thursday the 13th and finish it and pay out of pocket." The jerk responsible I found out used my old address. Apparently our information must have mixed I thought because they had my new address as well on-file. She asked me my middle name and the last four of my social it was used... Only thing different was the amount which was $6,650.00. I'm only getting 1,585.00 back. The account number they used to deposit the e-file into the date February 2nd I filed on the 8th. I didn't even have all my W2s and the phone number was different. Eureka, a bread crumb, which in I personally investigated the person who owns the number is related to a supervisor at a company I worked for. The lawsuit for the company will come later. I'm waiting on an arrest to be made but you know the laws by the book protocols... I contacted the FBI, the FTC, the SSA, the OIG, the SAG, the CREDIT BUREAU, the IRS and HOUSTON POLICE. So I ask you, is H&R Block liable for damages for letting someone go online and e-file a tax return using my personal and confidential information? They need to set up a verification procedure to make sure the person filing are who they say they are. Tell me what you think.
I got cheated as well. I went H&R Block Brooke Road, Richmond, VA. One ** by name filed my taxes, a very very rude person with less knowledge about what he is doing. He did not know what he was doing, finally after twenty minutes he charged $380. I earned only $6000 a year and my tax refund was $599. I was really at shock. When I asked him, he was blaming the head office generating the bill and they have no control over it. I wonder where on earth he will take this poor people money and die. I gave him since he was very very rude and tried to make fun, as if I was homeless person. Surely I know that God will teach him and his future family a lesson unforgotten. I will leave it in the hands of God, though at present it is a pain for me in my struggle to overcome. I have considered that I was generous to a beggar who begged before me.
The office had a sign about checking your previous returns for free so I left the past 3 years. I called intermittently about the status and the rep was working on them. Well, a year later, he was finally finished. He went over the review while I was having my 2013 taxes done. He found ~$700 due to me. I was charged $99.00 for the amended tax return. I told him I thought this was free and he said, "Oh, the review is free but completing the return is charged." It then took two visits to complete my 2013 tax return and getting no refund but paying state a lot. I am not working and only had stock sales to deal with. I was charged >$300 for this so >$400 total. I was in shock. I don't think I will ever go back.
I went with my dad to H&R Block for the last two years for his taxes. We used the same person and he was charged the same amount, $140. We went a couple of weeks ago and he told her that everything was the same as before and no changes other than his selling of a stock. My dad was charged $327. At the time he paid it and tried to shrug it off. He is 82. Now he tells me that it’s really bothering him. I called the 800 number and the guy set up an appointment for today at the same office for a review with the manager. I tried to confirm that there would be no additional charge for the review so I called the office directly. The manager wasn't available; another person did the review over the phone. This person said everything she could to confuse me. She kept throwing out form numbers with letters. I told her that all he did was sell one stock. According to his taxes in front of me there was one extra form. After five minutes of a run around I finally got it out of her that the 1040 from last year could not be used because of the sale of the stock, so they had to use a different 1040 and a form for the sale of the stock. To me this is one extra form. I told her, "so my father paid $187 for one form?", and she reluctantly said, "Yes". I was livid. How could this person charge my father like this and not let him know in advance? She defended H&R Block like a mama bear, until I had to hang up on her.
The interaction both me and my spouse had with branch manager Gordon was problematic. I would give this branch variously a 1 and a 4/5 star depending on the point and person of reference. Vicki **, the employee who worked on our returns was helpful and conscientious. In hind-sight I now see that she was not herself clear on the current stated HR Block national web campaign specifics. We were told that HR Block no longer did loans for anticipation of returns. However, this year a "return anticipation check" is offered; the web page states that the full anticipated refund amount (sans prep fees) should be deposited on an Emerald Mastercard. If the latter had been done (over 4K for this past year) we would have plenty of money now to pay as requested for past years' returns. The IRS verified a large refund but is holding the refund contingent on receipt of all past years returns. The returns are done, and an IRS tax agent is ready to push through our emergent case (pending eviction given the refund hold up). The agent was the one who told me about the anticipation check policy - but since we filed already with HR Block we are SOL since the manager Gordon did not honor company policy (or apparently apprise his own staff). We have no money and have been hanging on this return; Gordon attempted to placate us/barter with a decreased amount up front... but still hold some returns. This was not an option per the IRS and I let him know we were not able to meet even his stated "nominal" amount (I have the email). We must get our returns in for anyone to get paid for any year, and yet he seems content wasting his own employees' time without ever actually addressing the underlying issue. We were sent a caustic reply that, given my personal history with cancer survivorship was all the more demeaning. Our woes are "self-inflicted" and we were given a character assassination because we could not find family to help us out.... It seems that people in need are exactly the type HR Block states it wants to compete with the market - especially when we were more than willing to seed our entire return to them before getting a dime.... Quote: "Please do not patronize or try to intimidate me for making a sound business decision. It's a shame that in a world where people cannot pay their bills they look to pin the blame on someone else. Maybe you are writing a bad review about your landlord who is evicting you because you cannot pay your rent. Maybe you are upset at the grocer because they will not give you groceries when you tell them you have a tax refund coming to you. I empathize with your financial/tax set backs, but they are self-inflicted. In any case, understand that whatever reviews you choose to write won't hurt my feelings---it simply gives me a chance to explain in a public forum that if you don't pay, you can't play therefore stay away." It's a scary thought to know that you have several thousands of dollars in possible tax refunds coming back to you, yet you cannot find a single person willing to loan you a small portion of the money to pay for the work that has already been done..... hmmmm, what's wrong with this picture??? Wish you nothing but the best of luck in getting your tax issues resolved.
Firstly, my taxes were not filled out properly. I went to another tax professional for a second opinion and he told me my taxes weren't done right. Since I have a 1099 form some things are filled out differently. When I had gone back in to H&R to file for an amendment a girl named Erica became very verbal and rude towards me and started to claim I wasn't paying attention properly to Esperanza, the woman doing my taxes (whom also spoke very broken English). Erica started to yell at me and brought up confidential information that was between Esperanza and I. I was very uncomfortable because she knew some of the personal things I was discussing with the person who was doing my taxes. I like to think when I am getting my taxes filled out it is a confidential, not for someone to eavesdrop in on. Erica then proceeded to kick me out of the office after I told her "That's not how you treat customers and I wanted to speak with a manager." This makes me question the company in its entirety. What company hires such unprofessional people? Why were my taxes not filled out properly? It scares me to think that these people have and handle personal information of mine, acting the way they do. To the manager that hires people, hire people that are NOT out of control, treat customers in a professional manner, not hire employees that listen to confidential conversations, and hire people that can speak English properly. I called customer service, they took my information down and made a claim. I am currently waiting for a reply. I highly recommend not going here, they also overcharge. The tax professional I spoke with charges $130, H&R charged me $290.
H&R Block at Parkchester, New York located on Westchester Ave. - Absolutely terrible! They are very very unprofessional and have no idea how to do their job right. The lady ** who did our tax forms was very unprofessional, rude and disrespectful. They overcharged us and also there was a hidden fee which we had no idea about!!! There was a $35.00 bank fee which ** did not specify during our appointment and when she was confronted with this, her response was, "Just like you didn't clearly mention you didn't live in NYC for 1 full year, I didn't mention the $35.00 bank fee." Her response was childish, unprofessional and irresponsible. And just to point out we did mention that we just moved to the area and my husband and I use to live in Texas hence our W2 form clearly shows that my husband was making income in Texas!!!!!! It is common sense that if he made income last year in Texas, then obviously he was living there!!!! Before we got our refund, before we learned that we were ripped off they made a mistake with our forms and had to do an amendment. ** informed us that we will be receiving a phone call when the forms are ready for pick up. When she called she said, "Hello! I called you so many times yesterday, don't you want to pick up your forms? You don't want your refund money?" I was shocked. We did not get any calls nor messages from her. I wasn't expecting that kind of behavior at H&R Block. I actually suggested we go there instead of other tax file offices since I have done tax filing before in Manhattan where I am from. However I never thought it will come to this. I am very disappointed and furious. I am never ever going back to H&R and I have been trying to reach H&R Block main office to complain because they shouldn't have unprofessional people like ** working in such professional setting meant for well-educated professionals.
I have used H & R Block for almost 12 years. I honestly haven't paid attention to the cost but I dropped off a simple return - no dependents, rent, only a dental deduction. It cost $322. I do not remember paying so much in the past. I asked the office why it cost so much and they said that is what it costs. So I called the customer service main number to ask why is the cost is so high. I had a woman who seemed to understand and filed a RES claim, and gave me the claim number and said I would get a call between 3 - 5 days. After 5 days, no call, I called the 800 number again, and spoke with this guy who couldn't find my claim, but kept asking for my email address so I can fill out a survey how he handled the call. I asked, "what is my RES claim status you said you can't find," he says, "I found it they will get back to you." Called again yesterday, they couldn't find my claim and the rep was awful and I asked for a supervisor. Who was helpful said they couldn't find my original claim and opened a new one. I would have to wait another 3-5 days for an answer. My contact number for the last few years is my cell number. I came home last night and had a call on my home voicemail (not my cell that I asked to call) from an H and R rep, Barbara, who said to call back, referenced my original claim RES number but fumbled through the return call number and I couldn't understand the number, nor could a friend, only it started with 855 but on my phone directory the call came from the original 800 customer service I had been calling. So I called the 800 number just now, the rep was useless, I asked for Barbara and the rep said they do not connect to the claim office. I said what is the 855 number and she says, "we do not get those numbers." I gave her the original RES claim and she had it and now says I opened 2 claims and that there are 2 systems in their office so one cannot see the other claim. (I asked how come you know that but when I called yesterday, they didn't say that.) Now she goes it will be 3-5 days for a call back...I said that is now 10 days. I asked since my call back directory had the 800 number, and you are customer service how can you see the open claims, but the other customer reps couldn't and just told me there was no claim, or how can you not know the 855 call back number. Also, she says you gave your home number, I gave them my cell every time... I feel this is just a runaround in order for me to drop my question/complaint...really you work with financial information but your customer service and claim group doesn't connect with each other..and you don't know the 855 number or reps who call back. It is concerning on so many fronts, first the person who handles my taxes after a few years just told me he really isn't an accountant, he took a class to learn how to process taxes. I always drop off my form and w-2 then come back to sign when I pay, and they lost my papers and never filed. H & R Block used to be decent, now they are a rip-off and it is concerning since they have so much of everyone's financial information. I will never use them again, and I wonder if my taxes have been prepared correctly. If I do not get some sort of answer on the cost, I am filing a complaint with the better business bureau or the state attorney general office.
I did my taxes in Quesnel BC last year and year before that and the heaffer that did my taxes ran ahead on her own and had my direct deposit taken off my child tax credits (2 cheques worth $936/month) and my GST after paying her what I owed. That was already in question because every year I've done taxes. I've always received apx $400/year in tax returns the same day cash back. So when I ended up paying $100 and having over $1000/month in cheques put on hold until I could pay her the $50 I owed for last year. I was angry. I asked her if she could really do that and if it was necessary and she said yes. She could and she had to do so. So now we're getting cheques via old fashioned mail because direct deposit set up hasn't went through. Next year we will be going through the food bank to do our taxes as they are free and when we do qualify for cash back. They don't want to release the money and we had to wait anyways!! However, dealing with H&R in Ontario, I never had issues and always got my cash back the same day!! So this is likely a poorly run outlet!! When we called later and spoke with a different rep from the Quesnel location, he told us she wasn't supposed to take direct deposit off all our cheques, but standard was to put a hold on the GST, not child tax. But she did and I wasn't rude or angry, but did ask her if she had to do that… was it necessary?? And could she just do that?? And she did just go ahead with no permission of mine, called on my behalf and had direct deposit removed from all my cheques. I guess today is the first cheque back on d.d. after almost a whole year of receiving cheques by mail because of some terrible woman having a ** day and abusing her authority to toy with my finances. Never again H&R, never again!! I never received an apology, just denials. But it is what it is and she had my cheques all sent in snail mail as a perk of using her services that are costing me cash, instead of getting me a cash back return like every single other year I've done taxes!! Not cool and nothing I couldn't have done free of charge at my local food bank!!! If you're in Quesnel, I suggest steering way clear of H&R and seeking alternatives because I'm not a tax expert, just been doing my taxes for 17+ yrs and know what to expect. Three years in a row they provided crap services and that’s enough for me!! This year I'll definitely go elsewhere!!! =) happily.
I went to their office in 2010 to have our taxes filled out, paid 244.00. I received a letter from the IRS in 2013 letting me know they were never filed. Once they were filed we were told by h&R block that we owed a large amount to the irs so we paid it to South Carolina and North Carolina because my husband had worked in both states. We overpaid so we were penalized for it. I have been trying to get a refund for them doing my taxes and a refund for the fees I incurred because of them. They keep giving me the run around!!
I have had this company do my taxes for years. This year, without even mentioning anything, my cost increased almost 50%. In 2012, I paid $162.00 and this year my bill was $241.00. No explanation!! I was in shock. Are you kidding me??? I have since emailed my local agent asking why and have yet to receive a response. I will NOT be returning next year.
The agent working on our taxes this year messed up so badly not focusing on the numbers and reading that she had to get her boss to look it over and make required corrections. After the boss looked it over and they were "positive" everything was correct we mailed off the necessary documents and wait for refund. Well refund was taken by IRS because of a previous earned income tax for the year before. The agent sees where she messed up on the previous taxes but still wants to tell me that I owe them when she never told me to begin with that they were owed. She is trying to get around being an adult and fessing up that she made a mistake and pay us the money that is owed to us which is only fair when you pay for the insurance to cover these problems. WE PAY HER 340.00 FOR HER SERVICES AS A PROFESSIONAL. The reputation of H&R Block is only a scam. Do not believe them! My next phase is a lawyer because this is a winning case if they do not fix this. I now have to worry that the previous FOUR years need to be re-looked at.
I have had my taxes prepared at H&R Block for the last several years. I will definitely not be giving them my money in the future. I received a letter from the IRS stating that I did not turn in a form with my 2012 taxes and I owed $1043. My fiancée took the letter to the office I had my taxes done at and showed it to one of the employees there. The employee pulled out that specific return and stated that they didn't have a copy of the form either. My fiancée then went home and pulled out my paperwork and lo and behold, the first form that was stapled on top was the form in question. She called the local office and was told that because the "peace of mind" was not purchased, the only thing they can do is refund the preparation fee and the interest that the IRS is charging. I called the main customer service line and filed a complaint, expecting to get some satisfaction on an issue that clearly was not my fault. Again I was given the speech about the "peace of mind". Why should I pay several hundred dollars to have my taxes prepared, provide all of the necessary paperwork and then have to pay for "peace of mind". Shouldn't a company hire competent employees? Shouldn't a company be responsible for their employees negligence? Not according to H&R Block!! I now have to set up payment arrangement with the IRS because their employee couldn't be bothered to do his job. As I said at the beginning of this review, this company will not get another dollar from me.
Last year, H and R Block charged us $144 to prepare our tax return. My husband does all the preparation work ahead of time. All H and R Block had to do was insert the information into the computer. This year, we were charged $324 for the same amount of information. They said the increase was due to the amount of forms we had. We had the same amount of forms as last year. They consider a "form" as anything they enter into the computer, therefore, each W2 is an individual form, cash donations, church donations, medical bills, etc.are counted separately. I have contacted them and talked to several people, and they have all refused to give me a full or partial refund.
Charged $445 for tax preparation this year when I was only charged $99 last year.
I went to H & R Block here in Charles Town, WV Saturday, 03/08/2014 to have my taxes prepared. I've used H & R Block numerous times over the years, either online or brick and mortar. The lady was quite nice and told me the fee for me being single, no dependents, don't own a home or have a mortgage, no itemizing, made less than $50k for the year 2014, would be $115. This would include the $35 fee for direct deposit into my bank account. I could live with that. But this year was different because I had made some Stock Trades on Etrade trying to learn the Stock Market, almost all losses. A few Gains (I lost over $1800 this year in stock trades because I'm new at stock trading). The lady said for me to leave the paperwork with her, it would take at least an hour. She also stated that H & R Block charges $3-4 per stock trade, something about charging for each line that had to be filled in but she could do it a different way so that I wouldn't get charged like that. She would take care of it. Wrong! I got a call the next day, Sunday, that my taxes were complete, I'd need to come in and sign paperwork. When I got there, I was told my fees had gone up. And up they went. From $115 for a 1040EZ, which is what I've always been eligible for, to over $610 because I traded some Stocks this year. 89 trades total which means H & R Block charged me more than $5 per trade. Not the $3 or $4 the lady had stated the day before. Even if I traded the same company multiple times, I was charged for each separate trade by H & R Block. The puzzling thing about it is, she wrote all of the trades up as Short-Term trades, even though I owned some of the Stocks for years, and have paperwork to prove that. I wonder how much trouble that could cause if the IRS finds out. Etrade charges $9.99 per trade. I didn't realize H & R Block also charged per trade. The lady kept saying that she wished the IRS would allow them to just add up the losses and enter a single number for Total Gains or Total Losses for the year. But then how is H & R Block supposed to make their money? I'm sure H & R Block prefers that the IRS requires each stock transaction be separate so they can keep charging these per transaction fees. The losses I incurred through my Stock Trades would have added near $575 extra to my Refund. H & R Block took most of it. That's almost 2 car payments. I felt helpless but what could I do? The taxes had already been prepared and entered into the system. I will not recommend H & R Block to anyone, ever, nor will I be using their services again. I'm sure I can find a private CPA that will do my taxes for half of what H & R Block charged me. I may have to wait for the refund a little longer, but at least I'll be able to save some money and not feel like I've just been robbed.
I have been a satisfied customer with H&R Block, working with Billy ** at the Kirkland WA office, for the past seven years. Due to Billy's retirement and a planned relocation to the Kent area, I set up an appointment at the Kent, WA office with **. At my arrival, I was welcomed by the receptionist. Although ** was present and not engaged in any activity, she did not acknowledge my arrival or my presence. After a few minutes, she went to the computer and after a while, staring at the computer asked, "Dropping off or staying " Not knowing who she was talking to, I did not respond. She then looked up and repeated her question. After I responded, she replied after a few minutes, "Okay to come in". She also did not respond to a question from the receptionist as to whether I could bring my dog into the office and eventually responded to her with a monosyllabic "no". With the obvious lack of positive regard, negative demeanor, and a possible feeling of someone who did not want to work with me because of my appearance, I consulted with my wife and we agreed that it would be impossible to work with someone like this. I cancelled the appointment and rescheduled in the the office in Kirkland, driving the extra distance where we felt welcomed by all staff. We have had a strong working relationship with your company and will continue to do so but will not return to the Kent office. We strongly recommend additional training on office customer service for this individual. Thank You.
Went to H&R Block. My husband only had 1 of his W2s. He told the person at H&R that he would bring in the other. The person at H&R started to put in our info into the computer and then all these questions popped up: How did you feed your family? Have you ever been arrested and have you ever been arrested for drugs? Are you a gun owner? We ask what does this have to do with filing our taxes, the person at H&R said it was the IRS asking this. I have talk to other friends and family that had their taxes done, they didn't have any of these questions asked of them. So why is it that they asked us? Maybe because we have a Hispanic last name or if not, then why does the IRS need this info? Not good.
First off, I filed my tax return Feb. 4th last month. I was not too happy with the service, my tax preparer was nice but not too sharp. That's not why I'm pissed off. It's been over a month my tax return was accepted Feb 12th and said my check would be mailed within 21 days. I live in Cali so it can't take that long... or so I thought. I called H&R Block, went into the office and still no good answer as to why I haven't received my money and the IRS did their part already! The customer service rep told me my check was direct deposited into a dead account and had been sent back to H&R Block and they just remained it. Ha ha that was last week, they said it's been over 10 days nothing still... I want my money. I shouldn't have to deal with this nonsense. I paid over 400 dollars to get screwed. Thanks H&R Block for nothing. I should be reimbursed for this problem that's all H&R Block's fault.
My regular H&R Block tax preparer was taking a year off due to health issues. She was a very nice individual and for the last 10 years, I was always confident and comfortable with her. A new agent handled my taxes. Instead of getting a refund, I ended up owing about $2500.00. How can this be?!? Nothing had really changed from the previous year in my income. For four years, she had designated that I had opted out of Social Security ... which I had not. After four years worth of amended taxes, I owed almost $14,000. But, I had the Peace of Mind which means that THEY are supposed to pay for their mistakes, right? Well, that's only up to a certain amount. Once you reach that amount (which I did), YOU get the bill for the remainder of what's owed. Then, when this year's tax season rolls around, I get a 1099-MISC stating that I had additional income of almost $14,000. The explanation was that I had made this income, even though the money went directly to the IRS. Guess what THAT does to your 2013 tax return! You lose your earned income credit. You lose what would have been a refund and end up OWING about $1000. Needless to say, after you shell out a few thousand dollars of your OWN money because of THEIR mistake which could have been avoided, you are way beyond dissatisfied. You are angry! On top of that, I'm still getting letters from the IRS that I just take up to H&R Block and let them deal with it. Will this ever end with the IRS? Will I ever get to the point where I'm not owing? I certainly hope so. But, as for me and H&R Block, we have parted company. Believe it or not, I am not angry with my tax preparer. She is human and she did not intentionally make this mistake. However, I'm very upset with the company. Issuing me a 1099 for added income is wrong. I don't believe that any other insurance settlement is considered income. And, the people you deal with once you reach this level of problem talk like agents of the IRS. It is so complicated and above your head that you don't even realize that you aren't understanding what they are saying until you get that dreaded letter in the mail.
I went back and looked into how much my wife and I have been getting charged by H&R Block since 2007. To say the least, I was stunned! We have fairly simple preparation. 3 W-2s, and a K-11 (?) for oil royalties. We do not itemize, do not get the refund anticipation bs, do not get "Peace of Mind" added... Every year they have charged us roughly $600. Why did I just now decide to look into this? I feel like such an idiot! For starters, I thought about doing it myself this year, as the lady that did it every other year from H&R Block passed away last fall. So yeah... I will give it a shot myself this year. Ridiculous!
I went to H&R Block over the weekend to file my taxes. A simple return made under a thousand and they charged me $191.00. This is highway robbery. I want something to be done to these robbers and others like them. Then they claim not to have RAL anymore. If I did have a family emergency I would not have went to them. I am so disgusted. Like I had that to give them.
A single mother that I help out sometimes went to H&R Block in Hornell, NY 14895. She has gone there for years. They charge her $260.00 to do her tax return. They have all her previous returns to use for reference. She takes a W2 with her and she has no expenses to declare. This is robbery.
My wife and I went to H&R Block because she is a traveling therapist, and we wanted someone to help us understand what types of deductions she would be eligible based upon her profession. We were more than willing to have H&R Block files our taxes, but we knew that we didn't have enough information to file that day. The rep introduced herself but did not shake my wife's hand, not sure why. Within 5 minutes of sitting down, she asked if we would be filing today. I explained just what I said above, "We're not sure we have enough information to file today." We proceeded to ask a few questions about my wife's work. After 10-12 very specific questions, the representative sarcastically responds with, "I feel like I'm teaching a class. Are you doing this because you want to file on your own or are you going to file with us." Again, I respond with, "I'm not sure that we have all the info we need to file today." It's very clear she is upset that we won't be filing today and feels we are just trying to get "free info." She says, "I feel like you're just asking a bunch of questions today, and I'm ok with that, but that's not exactly how we do things." My wife says, "Obviously, you do have an issue with us asking questions." Lady backtracks and we finish the appointment shortly after. I had all intentions of using H&R Block for our taxes, but after this very rude customer service experience, you couldn't pay me to use them. I work in the financial service industry, but I don't work with a lot of person income taxes. This would be like someone coming to me for investment advice and me saying, I'm not going to give you any advice until you bring all your money to me. It's ridiculous!
I had my taxes done at the location in Lindenhurst, IL for 3 years and had no issue. However, in 2013 I had them filed at the location in Franklin Park, IL on Grand Ave. I was staying at my parents home for a few months to help a sick family member get well. The tax preparer at that location looked at my documents, which were just W-2 forms from my and my husband's employers. She asked me if I'd been there before and I said, "Not this location, but the another one for the past few years." She asked me why I was at her location, it was not close to my home. I explained that I was helping a family member and go back home on the weekends, where my husband still is. At that time she said she would not do my taxes and I would need to go to the location I had used for the past few years. I asked why and she said that my husband needs to be there to sign and he has to do so within a certain time frame. I asked if all married couples come in together to file joint taxes. She said no so I asked, "Why single me out?" She said she needed him there to make sure no fraud occurred. WHAT?!?! So, if a person wants to file their joint returns while their spouse is at work that automatically means they're trying to commit fraud? I told her to give me my documents and I'll have them completed somewhere else. She asked me to wait and went to go talk with someone, who I assumed was a supervisor. They said they would file them but my husband had to come to their office to sign them. before they close that night. I told her that wasn't possible as my husband's work was an hour and a half away and he worked till late. Another associate came to the desk at this time and asked what was going on. I explained and that person said I could file and take only the signature pages with me to have my husband sign and that they needed to be returned by a certain time the next day. I grudgingly agreed, as there were no other convenient tax preparers in that area. After finishing and charging over $200, I drove to home and waited for my husband's signature. When I returned the forms early the next day, the secretary mentioned that they didn't think I'd return.
I had my taxes done at H and R block on January 30th and was told they would let me know when they were accepted by the IRS. They told me very clearly that my RAC funds would be available within 21 days of acceptance by the IRS (it also states that on their website). After 25 days, I contacted H and R Block and was told there was nothing they could do to help me. I paid an excessive amount to have simple taxes done and now I am questioning the competency of the woman who did them. It is poor customer service at best.
The H&R Block Preparer never included my foreign income or advised me to file FBARs forms, both of which are required, even though I told them about it. Then my preparer told me wrong advice on how to fix it by them.
My college age son that lives in Houston went to the HR Block with a friend to file taxes. I have no confidence that his taxes were prepared correctly by a supposedly veteran that has been there 18 years. First, his taxes are very simple, he has nothing but student loans, has the student loan information in hand, he tells the preparer the information "I have nothing except student loans and a decent job". She never asked about any of the student loan information, then say she has many customers today and she thinks he is finished. She says go to the bank and get your routing number and come back. He says "why the routing number," she says "for your refund," he says "oh how much is it?" She says, "oh I'm sorry you owe $900.00." He thinks his taxes are filed but not sure how if he owes money. This is such an injustice for a young person. He says "that is why I hired a professional." I told him there are many standards of that word "professional". Young people please don't go to HR Block, there are professionals there I am sure but getting that person is a crap shoot.
Just got a letter from IRS saying I owe money from my 2010 tax return. Called H&R Block and they do not save return copies that far back when using free edition. Also did a mock up of this year's return on another website and there is a $600.00 difference in what my refund should have been.
My wife and I had our taxes done at H&R Block today. The person who did our taxes was completely clueless. We are a average family with a simple tax return and lady could not even figure out what to do with our kids tuition expenses. She was constantly asking for help from other people and even had trouble working the phone... seriously! They charged me $185.00 to do a simple return! Really H&R Block??? For that price I would expect service from a professional who knows what they are doing and can answer my tax questions. I have ZERO faith that my taxes were done correctly. I will NEVER go back to H&R Block and will warn all my friends and family....and everyone on Facebook. Get your billion back America.. Don't waste your money at H&R Block, get your taxes done by a real CPA.
Went to H&R Block for the first time under the assumption it would cost only $80 for tax service. Boy was I wrong, I have a simple ( state $160 FED $1600.00) EZ return and after the girl was finished she handed me the receipt after putting it on my charge card, "$202.50". I almost passed out! I asked why so much? and she said it would have been only $80 but because I have an HSA (Health savings account) that's why it's so much. She said see you next year! I said "no you wont". I have not in all my research after the fact, found anyone who has paid only $80 for their tax service from H&R Block, they simply do not exist! MY ADVICE TO ALL IS "AVOID H&R BLOCK"!
I had the same experience as Valerie of Chula Vista CA, here in Albany NY, with H&R Block. I filled out the emailed survey. My only criticism was the pricey preparation fee for a simple 20 minutes preparation, noting that this fee has crept up every year for the 18 years that I patronized H&R Block and that perhaps I will consider doing my own prep or looking for a less pricey taxes preparatory. H&R Block notified me that my review was rejected because “Unfortunately your review did not meet our guidelines for posting on our site.” It is very disingenuous to ask for input and then cherry-picking what they will post. What a sham!
I have the Emerald Card and have had it for several years. They locked my account today stating that it was fraud associated with it and I am unable to access any of my money... I was told four different stories and at this point I will not be able to get to my money until Monday... I have no gas in my car and no money in my pocket and I have a sick parent and six children... I was told I must wait until they sort things out to get my money.... My daughter will not be able to participate in Cat in The Hat day. My son will not be able to go to football practice. My son is sick and I do not have the meds I need for him... On top of all of that I was unable to shop for groceries... H&R Block is a horrible company. I will never trust another company again with my money... This is a nightmare. I cannot believe this is happening to my family... The worst part is they can go back six years and look in my account. I am pretty consistent on my charges. I am not buying outrageous things, I am paying my bills and school lunch, grocery store, etc. Normal everyday things... This company has done a terrible wrong and has placed my family under and even more terrible situation. This is the scariest thing ever to have no money... no gas... with a sick parent and six children for three days or more. I hope no one else ever has to go through this.
My wife and I had our taxes done by a Senior Tax Advisor at H&R Block in Highlands Ranch (9559 S. University). We were in the market for someone closer to Highlands Ranch. Our experience was terrible. Prior to visiting we had asked for an estimated price for a simple tax return. They couldn't provide an estimate which seemed very shady (anyone you do business with can do this). The consultation area is a cube farm with low walls. You can hear every conversation around you and they can hear your business including social security numbers and bank account/routing numbers. We were very unnerved by the lack of confidentiality. You might as well have been at Walmart getting your taxes done. Prior to our visit we did not receive a typical letter reminding us about the typical forms to bring in. As a result, I had to run back home and return with a few simple forms we had forgotten. In the end we had to schedule a follow up appointment. I received 9 phone calls with a 1 week time frame to set up a follow up appointment (which I had already scheduled). This was very frustrating, it made it seem as if they didn't have their act together. The lack of security for our files was a joke. They had a small cabinet that was unlocked. Imagine all your social security and tax info easily accessible to anyone. In the end we were charged 2x more for our simple tax return than we had paid the previous 2 years. We will never return to H&R block and I would not recommend them to anyone.
Sticker shock. Never paid closed to $250 for 1040. Last year I paid $160. I thought they all were pretty much the same... Boy was I wrong... I will never go back to them again. Buyer beware... Ask upfront what the fees are.
I've been a Block customer for ten years now. I am self-employed and my husband is employed. I know this sounds bad, but I never have paid attention to the fees charged by Block before today. I have learned that Block uses a scale to decide what charges they will charge. It depends on the amount of your refund primarily. For example, in 2010, I paid $511 plus bank fees for Block services. In 2011 I paid $543 plus bank fees, in 2012 I paid $570 plus bank fees. Thing is, my return in 2012 was over $900 less than previous year and I had a higher fee not to mention I paid $20 more in bank fees than previous years. That got my attention as I read other reviews on Consumer Affairs. I will be going to get my taxes done tomorrow and before we get started, I am demanding a run down of charges and fees. Reminds me of the utility companies. They charge erroneous fees to everyone and only those of us who catch it and dispute it, get away with not paying it. Go figure. Nothing like good ol' Uncle Sam.
I received an email request to submit a survey after H&R Block did my taxes last week. I mentioned some positive points and some constructive criticism. After submitting the survey, I was stunned to get a reply that my survey was "not accepted" because it didn't meet their "guidelines". I mentioned that I was quite happy with the person who did my taxes, but not with the cost, and that when I asked to see a breakdown of the cost, I was told it was against company policy. I left a message with H&R customer service but never received a call back. In addition, an appointment was scheduled by mistake right next to mine and the poor guy had to wait for a half hour. It made me feel rushed that he was being kept waiting.
For the last couple of years I have filed my daughter's income tax return and had the money put into my and my husband’s checking account because my daughter did not have a checking account. Had no problem. This year the refund was deposited in our account. Checked my account the day after H&R block notified me that the money was deposited. Went into my account and was startled to see the money was being returned to H&R Block. Called H&R Block and they had no idea why this was being done. Then called my bank to question why the return was going back and without me giving my name or account number the girl told me that it is being returned because my daughter's name was not on the account. Seems as though they have had a lot of calls like mine. I then called H&R Block back to tell them what had happened and the lady I talked to this time was aware of the problem because they were getting a lot calls like mine. I blame H&R Block, the banks and the IRS for not notifying their customers of this change. Now we have to wait for the bank to send back the money to H&R Block and then they will send my daughter a paper check for the money. Until then I am out of the money, because I wrote my daughter a check for the amount minus some money she owed me. We still had to pay the fees for direct deposit.
I went to this office in Ruidoso NM on Thursday 2/13 and had my taxes prepared by Barbara **, she did an acceptable job. I had a very simple return. When I left I paid by check - $171.63. They ran the check, gave it back to me with a receipt and I left. Friday 2/14 I received a call stating that my check for $171.63 did not run and I needed to come back and pay for services again. I went that very afternoon at 3:00 pm and put it on my debit card $171.63 again. I asked for assurance that the check was not going to be hitting my bank and the office manager Stephanie assured me that it did not work and would not be hitting my bank. Tuesday I see that the check did indeed hit my bank and so did the debit transaction... I went yesterday (Tuesday 2/18) and tried to get my money back and the condescending office manager would not give me my money back, stating that it could take a week. Or she could mail it to me. I'm furious about this!! I don't know how she got the job of office manager, but it is my opinion that she has NO business in that role. I'm still trying to get my money back and will do anything I can to let everyone I run across, that this location is run by an inexperienced "office manager". If the office manager doesn't know how their payment system works then she probably doesn't need to be administering it. But in a condescending tone she does understand why I might be upset. She refused to give me the phone number of the owner of that branch (or her boss) only giving me an email address, as she stated "he doesn't like to have his phone number given out." HR Block has done my taxes for 35 years, but I will never set foot in that office again! Get my Billion back??? Great commercial, however, I'm just trying to get my $171.63 double billed back! And I'm having great difficulty in doing so. I'm checking into a website to get my experience at this location known by all that are considering this location for their tax needs. Hopefully I can spare them the same ridiculous condescending treatment.
Went in to HR to file 2013 Taxes. I was told the fee would be $100-$200 which is already I could not afford being laid off last year and having bills to pay for having children that I am financially responsible for, I should got up and left, the reason being no set fees. Taxes were filed, refund amount was shown $3644 and then the fees $333.50 and a bank fee for $34.95 for having it directly deposit in to my bank account. I will be calling my bank to ask if that fee in fact was from the bank branch. My Taxes were already filed. I felt so used it was unbelievable all they say was $$$! I had brought along a friend to also have her Taxes filed after my Taxes were filed. No way we left, she and I agreed that was Wrong! I felt scammed, my friend also felt that I was just scammed! Also now thinking back they never asked about child care, nor charity donations, medical expenses, expenses in General. Was emailed to take a survey. I was unable to submit I believe the reason was I give them the rating they deserved.
Used H and R Block at home product. Won't ever again. Tried to call them and every time I'm on hold for more than 20 minutes then I get transferred all over the place from one department to another. Never in this life time will I use them again.
Last yr I filed taxes for both my wife and I and got fairly decent returns. This past yr my wife and I relocated same state different counties, however my return was okay not a great return but I didn't owe. On the other hand my wife had a more complex return. She has multiple W2 college loan interest, unemployment, etc. Well I tried filing for my wife again online and saw things getting complicated saying she owed state and fed. She was nervous and wanted to consult a tax professional. I'm not saying the tax rep that helped us wasn't pleasant. It's the fact no fees were discussed prior to filing. Last yr she was able to get college loan interest filing married single guess tax laws changed for this yr anyway... H&R Block came up with the same numbers I did filing online for my wife and they still charged her over $200 to file. I'm just very angry and annoyed H&R Block doesn't have a flat fee for preparation especially when one comes up owing both state and fed... Say $75 or even $100 something reasonable. The entire ordeal took no longer than 30 mins to file. I honestly feel H&R Block sells an insurance policy to protect themselves for any mistakes the tax preparers make. I fabricated that conclusion based on how the tax rep kept saying it's our guarantee how H&R Block will pay any fees, etc. if there's any inaccuracies in the claim. Afterwards a window opened on the computer screen asking if we wanted addition guarantee services for another $35-$40, I don't exactly remember. Please if any others feel as I do write your complaint, maybe I'm fabricating this belief in my head my wife and I were victimized.
I will never go to H&R Block again. I got charged $268 for ten mins of their time and still haven't gotten my taxes back. It's been weeks. Every time I call to talk to a manager they tell me it takes 21 days. But when I filed the lady who did them told me 8-14 days. This is the first year I've had problems with them and I will never go thru them again. I will gladly go to Jackson Hewitt from now on. My friend has gone there for years, always gets the best service and her taxes always come in on time or in the time frame they give her.
Inexperienced Tax preparer left out information and entered my banking information incorrectly, I paid for their service and asked to be refunded for the service that has too many ignorant mistakes and was hung up on and was refused service.
I have been a loyal customer of H&R Block for the past 3 years without incident except one time where I was not told about the difference between filing jointly (married) as opposed to filing separately as head of house. In turn, my now ex husband's bills were tacked onto my account and without. I had to go through a tax advocate to get everything rectified through an injured spouse's form. I decided to use H&R Block again this year. Problem is, my worker entered my account number to my bank wrong. I wanted my money directly deposited into my own bank's account instead of getting the Emerald Card because of the insanely high fees. I don't know what to do. I've been waiting on my money for the last 2 days and finally decided to call H&R Block today to see what the deal was. I asked her to verify the routing and account number with me and come to find out the account number was ALL KIND OF WRONG! I checked those numbers 3 times before I gave them to her and I actually GAVE her the paper I'd printed out from my bank's online website. SHE WAS LOOKING DIRECTLY AT THE NUMBERS AND STILL GOT IT WRONG. I am going to Turbo Tax next year and will be doing my own taxes. If this company does not offer me some of the 500 bucks I paid them to do my taxes (and I'm not talking about a 5 or 25 dollar coupon either) I will be talking to a lawyer and sue them. I don't like people messing with my money. I worked too hard for it and I can't afford these kinds of errors. DO NOT GO TO H&R BLOCK!!!! Their so-called peace of mind feature is a joke! Extremely angry!
I have been using H&R Block tax program since 1998. I have a tax business. This year I have tried to file 8 people's return all of whom use the program last year. All were rejected! I called and no one in tech support can tell me why. I was told I couldn't use H&R tax program and to file through the mail or take it to an H&R center. I use Turbo Tax for the first and guess what - they all went thru. These people have different email and direct deposit accounts so I do know why H&R is tripping. The audit checked is clear and I ran everyone straight up no deductions. Tech collect personal info but can't tell me they are rejecting. I use two different programs on two different computers - same results.
I went in to have my taxes done at H&R Block because I bought a house in 2013 and wanted to make sure I completed my taxes correctly. I had used the H&R Block online system the past two years & was satisfied with it. The gentleman who helped me was pleasant & professional, but he had to look just about everything up, had to ask a colleague for several answers, didn't know how to deduct my mortgage points (and didn't), had trouble with the HSA form, didn't ask me if I had had a theft in the past year (I had - turns out it's a line item and deductible - found THAT out from my Mother) and didn't write off the preparer's fees (again, had to find out you could do that from my Mom). Even though I had 7 months of mortgage interest and various fees to add to this year's taxes, my refund was only about $400 more than last year and I had to pay $235 for the service. In my opinion, paying 25% of your total refund in preparation fees to someone who I do not believe got me the maximum refund was a waste of my time and money. For this reason, I will not go back next year nor would I ever refer anyone to H&R Block for tax preparation services.
My son-in-law had his income taxes prepared last week by an H&R Block office located in the Rivertown Crossing Mall in Grandville, Mi. $19,000.00 in income, (1) W2, (1) child and (EIC) form to fill out. Total time with H&R Block was less than twenty minutes. Total charge was $402.00 or about $20.00 per minute. Wow, what a rip off! You will notice that they won't tell you what their fee structure is anywhere. They say, "we don't know until we do you taxes."
I was first told that the refund anticipation check meant that I would receive my refund faster, but in actuality it means my money goes to their account first then mine. Also I had mine prepared before the 31st of January but it didn't go in until I contacted them asking why mine doesn't show to be received by the IRS.
I made an online appointment to file my taxes with the H&R Block near me. The H&R Block office I went to is 4020 W. North Ave in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. When I arrived for my appointment there wasn't any front desk person to greet or give guidance, and all of the tax professionals seemed busy with other customers. Nobody said a word to me. I was ignored like I never even came in the branch. I waited for about ten minutes and I asked one of the tax people if the person I had an appointment with was there. He said that she was not scheduled for that day. My question is, why wasn't I called about the schedule change? Why was her name on my appointment email if she wasn't scheduled that day? He had no answers for me and didn't even bother to apologize. What a waste of time! I left and nobody even apologized for wasting my time. I'm going to another tax service, this was my first and last experience with H&R Block.
Don't use these people. Never had any problems with my taxes until I started using HR Block. Now I'm force to pay $800 for 2010 back owe and 2012 saying owe $1900. They screws up and they should be force to pay these amounts. I will never ever used these people again. Douglas, GA and Hazlehurst, GA, don't used them.
Charged me $396 for reg W2, had $14000 in income,, then to direct deposit an extra $35. What a scam.
My family has been using H&R Block for so many years and we have been satisfied through all of them. I've read the reviews on this site and I honestly think the majority of the problems people are having with H&R Block are their own fault. I guarantee the tax pros go through enormous amounts of training in order to serve you and make sure they know what they're talking about. I see reviews stating that the Piece of Mind service is no good because it didn't do anything, and it's obviously not true. They're not going to offer a service if it doesn't do anything, and I've seen many clients saved from large charges because Block ADMITS their mistakes. Also to the idiots saying you were charged too much and had no choice but to pay it, it's their policy that if you're unsatisfied with any part of the return (including the price) you don't have to continue, therefore you can get up and walk out at any time. You do not have to pay any fee you don't want to. Educate yourself before you try to complain.
Because they are filing the backload first and since it’s a weekend, they aren't even sending my taxes to the IRS until Monday which is 4 days after I filed!!!
To be clear, this is not finished, but I do want to share what I believe to be a serious problem and how it has not been handled so far. I'll update as events transpire. I've used H&R Block for the last 4 years without difficulty. This year something weird is going on. Their on-line program is not capturing the federal taxes withheld. I have called several times and tried on-line chat with no resolution so far. Of course I can't file the return as it is. This is kind of hard to explain. There is a flag that indicates the amount owed that changes as you go through the steps. This number is about $150 more than was withheld. In the checklist in the taxes section, the taxes due is stated as about $150 less than I paid. A little odd, but, moving on. Getting to the finish line the only question is whether I want them to calculate the penalty because of serious under withholding. Whoa! My documents indicate my withholding was within $150 plus or minus of the taxes owed. Set aside the amount of taxes owed is different in the two places in their program, the flag and the checklist, the program isn't picking up on the withholding already paid. There is a place to enter an amount of withholding not reported elsewhere. The instruction says not to enter amounts from W-2's, they'll calculate that separately. Except it seems they don't because stopping just short of filing still indicates withholding has not been calculated, and their little program that goes back looking for missing information says everything is just fine! So... in response to chat instructions I have cleared cookies and cache twice. Still not fixed. I have called twice trying to talk to a person. They have this automated robot that you are supposed to be able to speak to as if it were a person. This robot was not able to understand my question at all and finally put me in a queue to talk to a person. After waiting for about 10 minutes, the call dropped. So I went through the robot again, got put back in the queue again, and after about 30 minutes the call dropped again. I was calling from a landline so I don't think the problem is on my end.
I filed a Peace of Mind Claim with H & R Block for my 2011 taxes because the IRS indicated that the preparer (H & R Block) had made an error in filling out my return and calculating what I owed. H & R Block refused to reimburse me the additional amount I owed despite the fact that I paid extra for the Peace of Mind coverage and they admitted themselves that they had made an error on my tax return. I have filed a grievance with the Better Business Bureau but my advice to consumers is do not use H & R Block to do your taxes.
I began to fill in the information for my free Federal filing and when I reached the unemployment section I was immediately forced to be bumped up to the basic which charged me $14.99. When I then filed I thought this would be removed. It was not. Then I attempted to fill in the information for the State filing and was informed, prior to processing, that it would require $36.99. It was not filed. I then went to another very well known site and went through the same process and provided the same information and received a statement informing me that there would be no charge to file my Federal and no charge to file my State. I could have filed both at no charge. I then contacted H&R Block by phone and after a lengthy phone call where one of their reps had to keep putting me on hold to ask a supervisor for various things the result was that the charge for the Federal was removed. The rep. kept telling me I was charged because of the unemployment which required a Sch. C. This is not accurate. Now my concern is that I have filed the Federal on H&R Block but cannot afford to file the State with them due to the cost. The first cost was $36.99 and the supervisor reduced that to $27.99 which was still an issue because I could have filed both free of charge. I would like to know how this is legally possible? How can one company charge fees and another one not when the same identical information is used? They are going to be reported to everyone I can possibly report them to. This is wrong and needs to be stopped.
I have completed and filed my own taxes for years using different online tax services including Turbo Tax and H&R Block. In 2010, I was laid off of my job and while looking for a job for several months was forced to go on unemployment. In order to be able to sustain off of less than $1000.00 per month unemployment benefits I was forced to take money out of my 401k to pay off any debts I had above living expenses such as rent, utilities, food, etc. I was having difficulty finding employment due to the job market and the fact that my pay before being laid off was higher than the average employer in my field wanted to pay for an employee starting over. Becoming frustrated that I couldn't find employment I decided to enroll in school at a local junior college to acquire a higher education level and hopefully improve my chances of getting back into the job market. Once I notified the state where I reside that I had enrolled in school on my weekly update required to continue to receive my weekly benefits, I was notified that I no longer qualified for benefits. I once again had to dip into my 401k to have money to live off of until I secure employment. The company that handles my 401k notified me upon withdrawing funds that the 20% taxes would be cut but the 10% penalty would not and that would be my responsibility to pay. In January of 2011 when I filed my federal taxes, I was prepared to owe some money to the IRS for that penalty. I did as I had done for several years which was access H&R Blocks free file site and proceeded to put in my information. Originally I started out using the regular 1040 form but after completing an online questionnaire regarding my deductions, the site recommended that I use the 1040EZ form. I changed the information over to the recommended form and completed my return which included the 1099 from the investment firm managing my 401k funds. I put in everything on the form and filed. I was notified that I owed the amount of $369.00 which was less than what I expected but I assumed that it was correct and that due to the fact that I went from making over $50,000.00 a year to nothing that my tax liability had dropped as well. In December of 2012, one week shy of 2 years after filing that return I received a notice from the IRS that I owed over $2000.00 in back taxes for the 10% penalty on the funds withdrawal, plus an extra $684.00 in penalty for not reporting and paying that penalty in early 2011 when I filed the 1040EZ form for 2010. I went to my local IRS office and talked with them about the issue. What I was told was that there should have been a place on the form to put in a "code" that would notify the IRS that the 10% penalty was not paid when the funds were withdrawn therefore giving them legal opportunity to charge me an additional penalty for omitting that code. When the gentleman at the IRS reviewed my forms he said that I should have used the 1040 form because the 1040EZ form does not have a space to enter that code nor does it prompt the filer that the code is necessary. I was furious as had I stuck with the original form I started with instead of following H&R Block's program recommendation, I would have been able to enter that information and therefore would have received the proper amount I should have paid. I was out of work for over 2 years before securing employment and my wages are a little more than half of what they were when I lost my job. Now I'm getting certified letters from the IRS demanding payment. It is more than I can afford to pay right now with trying to get back on my feet and of course there is still interest mounting. I've tried to seek help from a tax lawyer but unfortunately none in my area want to discuss the matter because I don't owe more than $10,000.00. I live with the fear that my wages will be attached in a garnishment and I have no recourse. I contacted one of my local H&R Block offices when they started advertising "We can help you get more back on any return". I was told they would have someone contact me back and that has been over a year ago. Needless to say I've heard nothing!
I filed last year... Come to find out this year I didn't receive everything that I was entitled to due to the fact that the employee was fairly new! What?! Are you kidding me. Not only did she screw up my taxes but she harassed me. She got my phone number and called me repeatedly about a job offer in some other company she was working for after I told her that I WAS NOT INTERESTED! Left me voice messages and text me all the time! I should sue the company! But I decided to go to a different location this year instead of dealing with a bigger hassle. Better experience but something didn't feel right. I called the office that I filed in last year to ask a few question. Not only do they hire stalkers I see but also VERY RUDE employees. No thank you. Not filing with H&R again. I've had a fill with you.
I am a Certified Tax Preparer. I worked for H & R Block in 1986. After leaving their organization, I started my own practice. I have been preparing income tax returns for 28 years. During the past 6 or 7 years, I have obtained new clients who have previously had their returns prepared by the "Block-Heads". I have found numerous mistakes on Block-prepared returns and have saved my new clients quite a bit of money by amending their returns. Also, Block charges exorbitant fees for simple returns (which I can prepare in less than 1 hour). Please, folks, do not believe everything this company spouts. Their newest ad campaign rambles on about the $1 Billion that people who prepare their own returns left 'on the table' last year. In reality, Block wants over half of that $1 billion to be paid to them in their outrageous fees for amended returns. Stay away from Block and their national chain counterparts. If you want an honest tax preparer, please ask your family and friends and find someone who will charge far less than the national outfits, will represent you in any dispute with the IRS, and will do an honest job for you for an honest fee. Ask around before succumbing to advertising.
Two years ago, I moved near my mother and elderly grandmother to keep an eye on their well-being. I have been preparing my own tax return for the past 10 years. In light of my mother's and grandmother's fixed and limited incomes, I asked who they usually go to for tax preparation and they said H&R Block. They both informed me that they are each charged $200 to prepare their returns, and my mother usually receives approximately $200 in tax refund money, while my grandmother receives approximately $1,000 back, each year they filed with H&R Block. When I asked what type of forms were being filed, they said they both used a 1040EZ form. My mother and grandmother do not make even $20,000 per year in combined income, and I was quite outraged to hear what H&R Block charged for a simple 1040 EZ, especially since their refunds were quite small. I offered to prepare their taxes for free and I would pay the cost of the state tax return (federal filing online is free and the state return costed approximately $10 per return to file). I gathered all their documents, and being that they do not have much income and no investments, there was very little documentation to gather. Went to my computer and easily completed both returns in under 30 minutes, using the 1040 form. After I prepared and filed their tax documents, they both received a refund - my mother's being $350 and my grandmother's being $1,800. I examined their previous returns and noted that not only were they charged $200 for each filing, but that H&R Block failed to take the home heating credit into account for my grandmother (State of Michigan) and also failed to take some other basic deductions and credits available to her. My biggest complaint with H&R Block is that I truly believe that they are taking advantage of the elderly and those without tax knowledge, such as my mother and grandmother. Elderly and low to middle income people look to H&R Block because they believe that a big name professional service will do the right thing and get them the maximum amount owed back from the government. In reality, it appears that H&R Block does the bare minimum of work while charging exorbitant fees. My mother and grandmother were stunned when they saw the difference in the amount of money they were due back, and even more stunned that I only had to pay about $20 in online filing fees. (I am computer savvy and do everything online. It would have been free if I had chose to mail it in, but I was happy to eat the small cost for my family and it expedited their refund checks.) They had their refunds direct deposited less than 2 weeks after I did the e-filing - something H&R Block told them would cost extra if done through their service. I would never recommend H&R Block to anyone due to their outrageous fees and lack of attention to detail for their clients and would advise someone to go to a CPA or a knowledgeable close friend or family member to prepare their taxes before even considering H&R Block.
When finishing up my 2013 tax filing (federal and state), the usual consent/agreement screens came up and I went through them. One caught my attention "HR Block refund deposit account fee", I clicked agree, when I got to the last page I saw (besides the $19 state filing fee) a $35 HR Block refund deposit account fee... WTF?? So I did a quick Google and it is not necessary (for me anyway) because I am doing direct deposit and in no hurry for my return. So I went back to the HR Block refund deposit account fee page, unchecked the box and selected "I disagree "... the program took me back to where I had to agree to the $19 state filing fee, fill in a few blanks and " Presto"... all is well. What tick me off is that this HR Block refund deposit account fee, right at the very beginning instead of being legal mumbo jumbo, it should have been a very short paragraph in plain English as to what it is and the additional fee...
H&R Block did our taxes for 3 years. They were incorrect and we had to pay for their mistakes. Delay the process working with the IRS, in this way they said that they can cover for their mistakes and what it comes with it. My husband and I need to take time off work to solve our issues with IRS and Department of Treasury of Puerto Rico. This company doesn't comply with what they offer and what the charge us and other people. I call this agency and you guys told me to investigate you need more cases. Looking at this website, sadly there are other with similar issues. We don't have a lot of money and we got in to a lot of debt because going to them for a service which they didn't do it right and won't cover their mistakes. I want justice. The government should evaluate this company. I have a log of events and communication between us and H&R Block since the beginning until now.
Back in the beginning of 2013, I filed for my 2012 taxes. I am a military member and went to the tax booth they had set-up on base. My tax preparer was very old, which didn't bother me at the time, until he started saying things such as: "We don't need to go over this" and "If you don't know it, we'll just skip it entirely". He ended up making me owe money to H&R Block as the return couldn't even cover the enormous bill to "prepare" my taxes. I have since gone back and checked over my taxes myself (I have no experience at all with taxes or anything of the sort) and I should have at least received a enough to cover the "preparation" and some. I will never use H&R Block products or services again.
I received notice today from the State of Arizona DOR that there was an error in my reported income for tax year 2009. Well, I knew for a fact the AZ DOR was wrong because Angelia **, Tax Associate for H&R BLOCK prepared my return. With indignant posture, I stomped into my office to find my tax return for 2009 ready to give the DOR a lesson in mathematics. Much to my dismay, I found the error was mine, or rather Angela **. A 1099 showed $2955, but she only reported $555 on my return. There was ONLY ONE 1099 and it had ONLY ONE amount on the page. No calculation was even needed. It wasn't even a transposition of the digits. It was just plain poor quality work. Luckily I had purchased their PEACE OF MIND EXTENDED SERVICE PLAN for whatever that got me. It was only good for 3 years. I can't help but wonder if H&R BLOCK knows it takes the DOR 4 years to find the error and send the notice. I won't be going back to them for sure. I can probably get better quality out of the kid that mows my lawn. He always mows every blade of grass. He doesn't miss 2400 of them.
Went to store to purchase some items & card was declined. Didn't understand why because I just got paid the day before. I checked my transactions and see at least 5 transactions from another state that I was unaware of... The bank CLAIMED they did an investigation but I seriously doubt it. I only had one card (which I still had) and nobody knows my pin. They denied my claim and I had to take a $600 loss. They sent me another card which had the same account number. I closed the account and moved to another bank. I WILL NEVER DO BUSINESS WITH THEM AGAIN. NOT EVEN MY TAXES ANYMORE. I can't afford to take another loss like that. They may specialize in taxes, but they should leave banking to someone else.
I have had a terrible experience with this company. Their "peace of mind" coverage covers nothing. After having my taxes filed incorrectly by one of their agents, I was told that H&R Block was not accountable for this. I am still paying IRS fees from 2011. This company takes advantage of young female adults who come to them in expectation that their taxes will be done correctly. I am highly disappointed and will never use this company again, and I hope that the general public won't.
On Oct 11th through 13th, 2013 - I dealt w/ 2 so-called tax experts at a local Nashville H&R Block tax office. The 1st one was literally so ignorant of the tax laws and procedures that it was staggering. She did not know many things - things of which I would consider very basic. For instance, she did not know that there was a late filing penalty for returns submitted after October 15, 2013. She said that "There is no late penalty if the IRS owes you a refund". She went on to say that there "would only be a penalty if the taxpayer owed the IRS money, but not if the IRS owed the taxpayer a refund". I told her that I didn't think this was true, but she actually continued to argue the point with me, until I was compelled to ask her to ask her supervisor. Her supervisor then said that the penalty IS due no matter if a refund is owed or not. The next issue was this so-called tax expert was not familiar with the per diem expense amounts allowed by the IRS for out of town travel. The IRS indeed allows a daily per diem (a daily amount for meal expenses, one for meals and one for motel fees). These per diems vary in amount from city to city, depending upon the cost of living in those various cities. For the town that I was traveling to, the meal per diem was $59.00. But the H&R tax preparer said that's "too much, that the IRS would never allow that", and that "You can eat for $25 a day". WOW! I thought. She then said that if it is $59 a day, that would include the motel fees. I was flabbergasted! Her manager had to again correct her on both of these issues. The next day, I reviewed my tax return in entirety, and found an error (my error, a $600 expense that was put in there - should have been put in the next year's taxes). Still, it had to be corrected, so I asked them to delete that $600 expense, to recalculate my return and print new copies; however the manager said "Oh, don't worry about it, it would only mean about a $3 difference in your return." I advised her that I didn't care if it reduced my refund by several hundred dollars, that I still wanted my tax return to be correct. But she continued to argue the point with me, and did not redo my taxes. I had to then call their home office and complain, and only then did the tax return get redone. I will NEVER again use H&R Block to prepare my taxes. And if you ever decide to utilize their services, be very very wary.
I recently completed my tax returns for the last nine years using Quick Tax by Intuit and tallied my projected return without officially filing. I then called H&R Block and several local chartered accountants to issue a challenge of sorts. If you can beat the return I've gotten for myself using inexpensive software, I will gladly become a lifelong customer and never file my own taxes again. The two chartered accountants accepted, being confident in their abilities as tax specialists. H&R Block, on the other hand, wanted 900 dollars up front before they would lift a finger and would not guarantee that they could beat TurboTax. The clear loser here is H&R Block and I wouldn't recommend using them until they gain a little more confidence in what they do.
I called H&R Block back in April about a quote on how much it will cost me to file my taxes. I spoke with a lady named Jennifer ** and she had quoted me around $400 and so I asked what it will cost to file an extension since I did not have $400. She then stated that if I came in that same day and signed, it will inky be $14 since they had coupon codes that they needed to use. I took the offer since $14 was hard to refuse. I rushed my husband out of work so that we could meet and sign for to get the taxes filed. However since there was an error on one of my forms so I had to request a corrected form. So I have been back and forth on getting the corrected form. Until this day, I'm still trying to get the corrected form and so I decided to just go forth on filling and I will amend it later. So I had my husband rush in again to sign so we can file it and he called me and stated that we would have to pay them $305 to file. I am so upset that I was lied to about this. Now I can't finish up filing my taxes because they won't honor their promise. I will end up being penalized and on top have to pay them the $305. What a bunch of liars. I will be sure that this gets published so that no one uses them.
Duvall, WA H&R office missed the mortgage interest deduction on my 2010 return. In 2012, I paid to have my 2010 return redone and was able to get another $1000 back. My attempts for over a year to have anyone at H&R speak to me have been rebuffed. The accountant I use now charges me less than H&R Block and I am more confident that they know what they are doing. What a crappy company.
I submitted a written complaint during May 2013. The complaint addressed the history of my tax processing which was not simply delayed by untimely completed because of incompetence. I brought my original source documents to an office of Chicago Ave. The receptionist did not inform me that that the particular office was a seasonal. I did not hear from anyone for over a week and no one could account for the whereabouts of my documents. I received an email from and H&R representative who stated that she was about of the submit my income tax prior to the end of the month. The income tax forms were finally submitted 3 weeks after the deadline. I received a call today from an H&R Block representative (October 2, 2013) who stated that 1. my complaint was minor, 2. that a decision was made and I had been informed by 2 other representatives previously. I stated him that I never spoke to a rep named Pablo or another representative to conclude my complaint. He insisted that I was informed and therefore, implying that I am lying. DON'T USE H&R BLOCK. THEY ARE INCOMPETENT, LIE, AND HIDE BEHIND THEIR OWN WORDS TO AVOID RESPONSIBILITY.
A couple weeks ago, I got a call from Jennifer at H&R Block here in Anderson, MO telling me that if we come pay the filing fee, there was a refund check of $1400. Well we go to pay it and find out that nothing has been filed and there was no check... Fine. At that point, we were told the refund would be 8 to 10 days... So on call this morning on September 19th approximately 10:30 am to then find out that it's 3 to 5 weeks and because I was upset that they had lied to me they hung up on me 3 times... and while I was on the speakerphone the owner of this particular store decides to call me an "ass" not knowing I could hear her... Very poor service and very unprofessional. I will never use this H&R Block.
I have used H&R Block for years. H&R Block made a mistake several years ago and I had to pay more to the State Tax. So I started paying extra for the Peace of Mind policy. Last year H&R Block made a $2,200.00 mistake on my State return. I filed a claim and 7 weeks have gone by and they will not send my money. I have been told that I cannot have the phone number to Peace of Mind department and that the claim is being worked on. I have been also told that I cannot e-mail them and that the claim department can't help me!!! I want my money and I am pissed off! You want Peace of Mind? Don't use H&R BLOCK!!!!
I had my taxes done by the so called "professionals" for 2011. I just received a notice from the IRS saying I owe them almost 3,000 dollars because of unclaimed income. I will NEVER use this service again.
I paid to have my taxes done by these "professionals". The lady who did them told me I might not get a state refund because it was a very small amount. When I never received it I decided to call and make sure they were filed. They weren't! When I went back to have it corrected the last was very rude and told me it wasn't their fault! I will NEVER use H&R again!
Don't bother to go to H&R Block. Their math skills are worse than a one-year old. They wanted to charge me $400 for 3mins. worth of work and $1,200 was my total tax return. I did my own taxes with IRS help and I got back almost $6,000. Never go to H&R Block. Do it yourself with IRS help. This place is located in Long Island, NY.
I filed my taxes but I did not have my account number with me to have my tax return deposited into my checking account, so I went to Chase and asked to be given my account number. Little did I know, the stupid man who helped me at Chase gave me an account number of another woman with the same name as me and all my tax return was deposited into that account. I've called H&R Block to try to get my money to my account and they keep telling me it's the IRS who I need to deal with. Then I called the IRS and they told me that H&R Block needs to help me. Then I went to the bank and they told me H&R Block needs to recall that money back so they can deposit it to my account. I called them again and they keep telling me that I can just go to the bank and get my money. This stupid company is useless! I'm so upset. They are nothing but a piece of crap company who doesn't help.
H&R Block failed to e-file my State Tax return when they filed my Federal Taxes. I did not know until I contacted them, almost 2 months later, questioning where my State refund was, only to be told it was never e-filed... What??? I contacted our tax preparer we have had for the last 26 years, at her home phone number, to try to find out what happened. She had left the office early this year, and had no idea our taxes were not filed. This caused extra penalties and interest in paying our Federal taxes, for we were going to use our State refund to pay our Federal Taxes owed. We had paid over $320.00 to have our taxes prepared and then incurred another $150.00 in penalties and interest on our Federal Taxes. I pursued this error with a formal written complaint to H&R Block on June 3, 2013. I was informed it would be 3 to 5 business days before I would hear from H&R Block. It has now been 16 business days, and every time I call to try to speak to a supervisor about my complaint, I get the runaround. I have yet to speak to anyone who can resolve my complaint. This is ridiculous :(
Location is 337 US Hwy 46, Parsippany, NJ (973) 882-6554. I had this H&R Block "tax professional" complete my 2011 Tax returns for Federal, NJ State, and NY State. I ended up paying $1460 federal, $483 NJ, and $311 for NY at that time. I also paid $398.75 to H&R Block for their "services". Frankly, I would've been better off doing my own taxes, and I've never done taxes myself before. Flash forward to 6/2013 and I got audited by the IRS saying I owe $4,375 for my 2011 tax return. I had to hire a CPA, and pay him more money to get my 2011 taxes redone. I am currently shuffling through paperwork to find all of my deductions. I found out they did not include simple tax deductions such as my yearly income taxes on schedule A. The woman who did my taxes was a "representative". The office had 2 people who knew how to do taxes. The rest were just paid "interns" as I call it that had more questions for the others than anything else. I had to walk her through all of my deductions that I knew about; the rest I would hope she would work in my favor. But clearly this wasn't the case. I am now fighting with them to get my "fees" back that I paid to them in 2012. AVOID THIS PLACE AT ANY COST. They are very, very BAD!
I originally started using H&R Block in 2006. The professional I met with was good, and I felt confident using their online eFile option for years...until this year. I'm currently an enrolled college student, and I just found out last week that not only did they screw up my 2012 return, the IRS said they also somehow messed up every eFile return I ever sent using their software. I was never notified by the IRS, the State, etc., about any issues; I found out on my own after I noticed they're having a problem with the 8863 education credits. I had to go to a CPA and refile EVERYTHING for the last few years, thanks to these clowns! Luckily for me, my returns are only for refunds from simple W2 withholding, but what a nightmare.
On February 7th, I went to the Countryside location to do my taxes on my own for the first time with my W2s from 2011 and 2012. I just turned 18 at the end of last year and never filed in 2011, so I was looking for quite a bit of information from the adviser, Beverly **. I explained to her that I did not file the year before, and though I still lived at home with my mother and my two younger siblings, I was eager to file my tax returns, but I was uneducated when it came to this topic. She told me that my returns would be simple because I was only working part-time, since I was a full-time student. Though my appointment lasted about an hour, I was surprised when I wasn't asked many questions or explained to me any of the forms she was filling out. I was given paperwork stating that I would receive a federal refund of $433.00 and a state refund of $15.00 for the year 2012, and a federal refund of $499.00 and a state refund of $21.00 for 2011. I was pleased to hear that I would be receiving this amount, even though I wasn't satisfied with the customer service I received. Yesterday, my mother went to file her tax return and was surprised to hear that she couldn't claim me because I had already claimed myself. She was very angry, and I wasn't even aware that I had done this. It was suggested to her that I amend my return as soon as possible. I called the Countryside location and explained my situation to an unknown man, who agreed with the suggestion my mother received and told me that it would cost $235.00+ to correct my returns. I was in awe that I had to pay hundreds of dollars to fix a mistake that I did not make. I specially informed Ms. ** that I lived at home and my mother claimed me, and she filed the paperwork stating that I had no dependents. I wish I would have gotten this man's name, because he wasn't very helpful and said that I needed to contact Ms. ** with any of my concerns because she did the returns. Since I was frustrated and lost, I called the Lyons location and spoke with Pamela **. I explained my entire situation and asked for advice as to how I should continue, because I didn't want to penalize my mother for someone else's mistake. She was kind and seemed genuinely interested in helping me. She apologized that I had to make an extra trip and that I wasn't satisfied with my first encounter with H&R Block. She fixed the issues with my returns and explained every step of the way. She answered all of my questions and even stayed past closing time to finish helping me. Unfortunately, I now have to pay a balance of $382.00 for federal and $102.00 for state fees, and that is only from my 2012 return. It is extremely aggravating that I now have to work backwards and send back more money than I received because my returns were done incorrectly. My concerns were that my mother will be looked into or penalized because not only did I claim myself for 2011, she also claimed me. She will also have to file by mail, because it will take up to six weeks for the changes to process, instead of paying the money she would owe if she couldn't claim me, and then receiving the money back later. I am amazed at how much chaos can be caused by Ms. **'s mistake. I was given contact information for the district manager and location manager, but after countless emails, I never heard back. Since I still needed to amend my 2011 return, I went back for my third visit, and they said they would have to charge me $200+ to fix the return, which was outrageous because it was their mistake! I called the customer service hotline, and they set up another appointment about a week or so later so that I could get them fixed for free, which the office refused to do. I filed claims for the $250.00 I paid, and they still haven't been approved. Not only did their errors affect me and my mother, my school is also withholding my financial aid because my filed taxes don't match my mothers! Horrible experience that I am still dealing with five months later!
This has been resolved.
I recently had my first and last experience with H&R Block. I thought it would be good to have my info on file for future needs. I usually use Turbo Tax which costs me around 80 dollars with everything included (and have never had any problem). At their office, it cost me 160 dollars and their so-called "Tax Experts" put the wrong account number on my direct deposit. Now my money is in someone else's account. They have horrible customer service and basically acted like it was my fault for not double checking the 75-page packet I left there with. I gave them a check to take the number from so I figured the "Tax Expert" should know how to read. Now I am just waiting until they get my money back from the incorrect account and deposit it in mine. I feel they should be paying me right away and they should be the one waiting for the money back from their mistake. I really hope no one else has to go through what I am going through now because of them. I am financially in serious trouble because of this. Please do not use this company for your taxes and especially not this office. I am going to do my best to make sure that I or anyone I know will never use H&R Block again. I have been leaving a review on a new web site every day and will continue to do so until I cannot find any more.
After filing my taxes, and purchasing a "Peace of Mind" policy, I received a Certified Letter from the IRS, and immediately went to H & R Block where I submitted the letter to ** prior to April 15th, 2013. I re-visited the H & R office to speak with him approximately 2 weeks later, and he stated that he was still very busy, and once the tax season ended, he would take care of this matter. I again received a Certified Letter that contained the breakdown of fines and taxes due, and it included a waiver to sign. I immediately went to the office located at 1850 41st Ave., Capitola, CA. and it was closed since tax season ended. I have called repeatedly at 831-462-1685 and left my number and requested he return my call, along with sending him e-mails. They have not returned any calls or email responses to my inquiries. This is basic refusal to communicate or act upon the "Peace of Mind" policy, or assisting in the IRS Audit appeal procedure that they are required to assist with. I am 63 years old, and am extremely stressed over their lack of support and refusal to cooperate in the filing of an appeal for the IRS Audit. I believed in their services, and now believe they have hung me out to dry! What fraudulent practices, and preying upon us that they are a professional and honorable corporation! I am going to make an appointment and demand the assistance they promised me!
I had my taxes done by H&R Block, and they wrote down the wrong amount for my income for the year which put me in a higher tax rate. I have to pay them $803 for their mistake. And because I didn't pay them more money for satisfaction guarantee, I get screwed. The reason why I go to these people is so I don't screw up on them. So in the meantime, they get my $374 to get them done and don't have to refund me at least that money is wrong! I know I’m not the only person having these issues with H&R Block. So when is someone going to do something about this? They don't have a problem going after the IRS when they are in the headlines.
I bought the H&R Block software because it was cheaper than their competitors with the rebate from Office Depot, turned in the UPC label, form, and a copy of my Office Depot receipt. They invalidated my rebate because of "an invalid vendor" - it had to be from Office Depot and the receipt was from Office Depot! Also, I had problems with their buggy software and ended up having to amend the return by hand. Obviously, you can't trust H&R Block to do the right thing. I would not advise using them or their software.
On 3/4/12, I went to an agent to have taxes done. I had a foreclosure last year which had to be put in the taxes. The agent figured my taxes but stated something looked wrong and she was going to have someone else look it over. I called the next day and was told to sign and pick up my copies. That is when they informed me that I would get $4,800 from feds but had to pay state $5,600, so I had to come up with around $800. I closed out my savings account and sold some stuff to get money. I sent the state their check but knew something was wrong. I looked over the return and found a mistake. I had several people look over the return and agreed that it was a mistake. I call the agent's office and had to wait until she returned from her time off. When she returned, I called several times to be told she is looking it over. I even told them where the mistake was. (I had a loss from my foreclosure of over $100,000 on the fed return they put in as a loss, on the state they put it in as profit, makes a big difference.) The agent had to work with several other agents to figure this out and finally made my amended return. I get my $5,600 I sent to state along with $860 I already paid. Now the fun starts. They sent my amended return through regular mail, not electronic filing which the state does allow. I have to wait 6-8 weeks, if I'm lucky to get my refund. I put a complaint into H&R Block and after about 7-8 calls, I finally had someone call me to only state that there is nothing they can do. They made the mistake. I had to close out my savings account, sell some of my stuff to make this payment, and now I have to try and get a loan to get repairs to house done. They asked what I wanted done and I told them to give me my refund and when check comes, I will sign over to them. I was told that will never happen. I asked about interest on the money. I have to take load out to cover their mistake. They can't do that. They stated they will try to get me part of money I had to pay to have taxes done, but it was not official. I don't think I will ever go back to them. I have had them do taxes for last several years. What else did they goof up?
I have a TVA pension which is tax exempt under Bailey exclusion. I have been using H & R to file my taxes since 2009. The preparer had no idea about the exemption and added it to my income. I just found out and filed amended returns for 2009-2011. My refund $6000. I also received my TVA settlement in 2006. My refund for 2006-2008 could be around $10000. Does anybody have any suggestions?
I work part-time and am a student, so I have always have an easy tax return every year. For the last three, I have used H&R Block to do my taxes. The first two times were somewhat pleasant, although I always thought that $130 was a little pricey. Boy, was I in for a surprise this year. The only difference in my tax return between this year and the last three were this year, I also tutored and received some income through a tutoring agency and thus had to fill out one additional 1040 to deduct gas mileage. Little did I know that this one small change would make their fee jump from $130 to $350. The lady I used this year was old and no idea how to use the computer, which made my appointment last way too long. Usually, we are done in 20 minutes. This year I spent almost 2 hours sitting there as she fumbled around on the computer.
I did not think twice about going to H&R Block to have my taxes done. They have been around for as long as I can remember, so why should I worry that I would not be treated fairly? I sat down in the cubicle and the preparer started to ask me questions. He then repeated the answers out loud, including my social security number. There is no way the person in the next cubicle did not hear him. After we finished he told me that the cost was 3 times what I had been paying a CPA for the past 3 years. He asked me why I had not gone back to the CPA to have my taxes done this year and that I was free to file a complaint with H&R Block, which I did. I was told that the complaint would be processed and I would hear from someone within 5-7 days. They also had the preparer call me. He called to tell me he was too busy to speak with me. Then he called me Andrea. My name is Sharron. I waited for someone to call me back. When I followed up, I was told that my complaint had been assigned and I would hear from someone very soon. 4 days later I got an e-mail saying they had tried to contact me but could not reach me. That is an out and out lie. Nobody contacted me and I told them so. No reply. A couple of hours later, I got another e-mail with a satisfaction survey attached asking if I was satisfied with the way my situation had been handled. These people do not give a damn.
I have banked with H&R Block bank and used the emerald line of credit for over 3 years. Taxes were done with them for at least the last 6 years. As of today, they have lost all my business. They absolutely screw you on the amount they charge for tax services. But today, after paying off my emerald line of credit, they decided to charge me $5.07 interest for the time it took for my check to clear. I called and tried to resolve this, but after talking with 3 different employees (which is what you have to do every time you call) and them making the decision to lose my business over $5.07, I am done doing business with them. I am so fed up with big companies thinking they can screw everyone over and nickle and dime you out of every possible cent they can that I will enjoy when you call me to set appointment to do my taxes and I can tell H&R to go ** yourself!
I have been using the HRB online tax filing (both Federal and State) services for over 10 years. In March 2013, when I attempted to log-on to complete and file both my Federal and State 2012 Tax Returns, much to my surprise, my log-on would not work. Thinking that I may have entered an incorrect password, I entered my email address in an effort to reset the password. To my utter dismay, HRB responded with a message indicating that my email address was not recognized. I tried everything I could to reset both my ID and password and in every case, I was not recognized in their system. I called their support hotline and was routed to a technical support area, and I explained the log-on situation with them. Their response back to me was unbelievable. This is what they said to me (i.e., a customer): "Your account is no longer on our system! Your historical data is no longer on our system! We do not know how, when or why it was deleted! There is nothing we can do!" I was absolutely appalled at this response! As an IT professional, I was stunned not only by their responses, but more importantly to their total indifference and lack of concern for the loss of sensitive financial customer data, the fact that they could lose data and be totally indifferent in their concern for this loss and the total lack of concern for the customer. I was absolutely stunned at their response. Finally, like many corporations, they have defined and published corporate standards regarding the ethics of their work environment, the importance of customer relationships and principles of doing the right thing. Based upon my experience, HRB has violated their own principles and standards on customer relationships and principles of doing the right. Fundamentally, they have proven to themselves that they cannot be trusted and have absolutely no business integrity in their IT Operations. My recommendation to anyone that reads this posting: If you are a current online user of HRB, download your historical data immediately. Remove your account from HRB. Find and use a more reputable online tax filing company that has a higher standard of ethics and integrity. If you are considering using HRB for the first time to file online, I recommend that you also find another solution. Just remember this important point that by HRB's own admission that they lost my historical tax data and that they do not know how, why or who deleted it, there is a very strong possibility that this data was either stolen and/or carelessly lost by HRB. By their actions and own admission, they have put both myself and my wife at risk for identity theft and loss of financial resources. You do not want this to happen to you!
My wife and I are 35 years old and we have done our own taxes through college and grad school. This year, things got a little more complicated because we lived in multiple states and started fellowships for which taxes were not withheld. We thought the responsible thing to do would be to get a "professional" to do our taxes to make sure we didn't make any mistakes. In the end, we spent $400 and far more time and stress to teach an unqualified "tax expert" how to do our taxes. We started going to H&R Block in November to make sure we were way ahead of the game, but our taxes finally got filed on April 15th only with a lot of pressure from us in person, in email, and on the phone. Our H&R Block guy was very confident and seemed to know what he was talking about. However, we had to meet with him 3 times over 5 months to keep bringing more forms (or the same forms) and refreshing his memory about things we told him several times in person and in emails. Every time we spoke with him it was as if we were starting from scratch. We basically sat there, held his hand, and gave him each number he needed to fill in on the H&R Block tax site. Each time we met with him (or emailed him) he said he would finish up soon, but needed to do a little more research on our fellowships to see how they would be taxed. On April 15th, we ended up taking a day off from work to stay home and call him several times; each time he would "call us right back", which never happened, and then we would call him again an hour later. There was no urgency on his part despite us knowing we owed Federal and state taxes. We finally got everything filed by the end of the day, but we will be going to a real professional to have it all looked over in the next month. This experience was ridiculous. We could have done this ourselves (and we basically did) in far less time, and it wouldn't have cost us $400 and a couple of days off from work. What a scam.
I have had H&R Block do my taxes for the past five years. In 2011, I paid $568 for my return and today I paid over $800! I was flabbergasted, to say the least. I was told that I completed less forms than last year, but since I waited until today, there was a surcharge. I wish I would have been informed prior to my appointment. Nothing was mentioned about increased charges, much less a surcharge. There was nothing I could do but pay!
I amended my 2nd W2 the day before the deadline & I called & called at least 10x or more just to get my refund process correct! And these people are so very helpless! They ain't worth a ** & no good for answering or resolving customer's tax errors. On the scale 1-10, I rate it at a ten negative & it's still going on today & I have not gotten a thing resolved at all. I've been hung up on numerous times; I call back & there is a 45-minute wait or longer & I still cannot get a right answer. I either keep getting transferred to another department or hung up on. After I get my amended tax refund resolved (if I ever do), I am deleting my acct. with H&R Block & I don't want anything to do with them ever again to this day forward. So that is why I don't recommend H&R Block to anybody to do their taxes & other important things at all.
Last year, our charges were $172 at the same office where we had this year's taxes done for a total of $242. Always ask what the fee will be before you ask them to complete your taxes. I will never go to H&R Block again. Totally a ripoff for the time they spend with you.
I went in to have my taxes done. After 20 minutes of the tax professional typing in numbers, she then tells me that my fee is $250! I was outraged. Not only do I owe, I always do, but they charged me all of that for 20 minutes! I then left and they called and offered me deductions! I am outraged. I pay my taxes, plus some! There are people that sit home and make more money than I do, and I am being punished for working for my family.
I made an appointment at an H&R Block in NYC weeks ago for today, April 13th, for a free second look. My original tax guy way overestimated what I owe for my quarterlies and I want a second opinion. I called this morning to confirm my appointment and they told me it was cancelled. They didn't even call me on their own. I had to call to find out it is cancelled. They said someone else in the office could see me, but I specifically made an appointment with a senior tax advisor with 15 years of experience and who specializes in what I need. I have very specific needs as a self-employed/freelancer to discuss with someone experienced not just any tax associate, specialist or advisor. Taxes are due in 2 days and I waited three weeks for this appointment. They advised me to wait and see the woman I originally made an appointment with after the tax season. I now have to pay my way overestimated quarterly, then make a new appointment and get it all annulled. Thanks a lot, H&R block. It could have all been settled today before the 15th. They're very unprofessional and I will not be going to them.
I made an appointment with H&R Block in Shawnee, Oklahoma for 9am. I arrived and they said, "What appointment?" The lady named Rhonda is very rude. We are sitting here still waiting and we are looking on the internet for another person to do our taxes. I am just disgusted by their customer service! They made me feel like they are doing me a favor by being at their presence!
I went to a H&R Block tax professional to file my tax returns online. Mine is a simple case with no complications. That person did it online and asked me to approve online but their online system has some technical problem and it is not allowing me to approve. It keeps asking for spouse's PIN and spouse's 2011 AGI even though I am filing it as "Married filing separately". It does not provide any box to enter spouse details. I tried to call their support desk on the same number they have given on their website. They are so pathetic. Every time I call, they keep transferring to different places telling they are bank or digital or online, etc. The tax professional who filed my return wrote a very simple mail telling she cannot help me in any way. This is the kind of service despite of paying $410 as fees? Definitely, I expected a professional service. The tax return deadline is approaching but I don't know what to do.
I have used H&R Block for several years. I recently moved from one side of town to the other and decided to use the location closest to me. It was a big mistake! It was the same paperwork, the same job and they charged me $150 more, almost $500! The tax preparer was horrible and did not know the software, did not ask any questions, did not help in any way and then to insult me with a $500 bill? It's horrible. Even worse, when I spoke with the manager, he completely ignored the fact that other locations only charge $292 for the same forms! He refused to do anything about it. I will never set foot in an H&R Block again and neither should you!
After my father passed away in January, I took over the financial details of my parent's estate. I took the 2012 taxes to the local H&R Block office to the "professional" who had done their taxes for years. For convenience, I had the agent do my taxes as well. Both taxes were done in timely fashion - brought my widowed mother to sign her return and I signed mine. We're told we would get our refunds in about 3-4 weeks and paid $470 for the two returns. My mother got her return back in about 3 weeks, which was great. After one month, I still haven't received mine and went to H&R Block's "Where's My Refund?" to check. I plugged in my name, SSN, birth date and refund amount. A message came up "refund not found." I called H&R Block's corporate and they told me my birthday was entered as **. Again, **? This is 17 years off my real birth date. So I called up the H&R Block agent who did the taxes and ask him about this. He told me, "I didn't know what your birthdate was when I filed your taxes, so I just arbitrarily made up a date." So now the IRS is holding my taxes for review and God only knows when I am getting my refund. Meanwhile, I am having to draw off of my savings to pay bills, where this refund amount of over $1,500 is supposed to go! Who the hell makes up a birthdate for legal papers?
I had to do an amendment on my taxes for my student loan, and the employee did not do it right. He didn't send the papers in there that was needed to send to IRS. They shouldn't be handling taxes for people if they do not know what they are doing. I am so sick of these people it isn't the first time. A while back, someone sent me something about a lawsuit but I ignored it. I was going to give them the benefit of the doubt, but I am done with them people. This happened in Lancaster Ohio 43130. My name is Sharon ** and I was depending on that check. Now, I have to wait more time because IRS sent it back to me and I had to get the proper papers. I paid them good money to do my taxes. Now do something about them. If a lawsuit comes up, I want to be included in it.
I purchased the H&R Block Premium software. At the end of the e-filing, it states: "E-filing your federal return is free with your key code, which you can use up to 5 times. Otherwise, it costs $9.95 (sales tax might apply)." Upon me e-filing the sixth return, the software would not allow me to e-file and pay the $9.95. I feel that is false advertisement!
I've had a hold put on my debit card which also contains my weekly payroll. No one will let me know anything nor will they even make an attempt to call me back.
I had H&R do my taxes a few years ago. It was a disaster. I'm going to make this short and sweet. They do not file retired federal employees, who are also on disability taxes, correctly. I sat and did my taxes with the lady at H&R. When I got home and realized how much my refund was off, I ended up going back to the office and literally sitting and doing my taxes with the lady two different times. Then after all that, they still didn't want to refund my money for doing my taxes wrong. Here's a big free hint: I contacted the head of the marketing department with H&R and I got my money back within a day. Anyway, this year I just tried another tax site (other than the one I normally use) just to see what the refund would be. They had the same error as H&R in calculating my refund. So by this time, I'm thinking my taxes had been done wrong for the last few years and I could be in trouble. So I went directly to the source and actually read the IRS publication on retirement wages and disability. Guess what? H&R was still wrong. If you would like for me to look over your taxes, email me at **. I don't want any personal info, just the pertinent figures used for all your tax info. We can see if maybe other people had their taxes done wrong too.
It took me one minute to get a live person to talk to about how to correct my state refund. The software was not right. Of course, Manager Barry ** kept filling my state refund. All was needed was the page 4 to be faxed. He said he cannot get in touch with them. I took out my phone and the lady told me to fax page 4 for the car tax. I went through weeks of this and they offered me half off next year. All I want is a $15 or $20 gift.
I went to H&R because my taxes for 2012 were somewhat complicated, I thought. I went and talked to a "tax professional" who knew absolutely nothing and he was like talking to a blank wall. My income from 2012 was less than $10,000, and he quoted $634 to file my taxes. Obviously it was a short visit to that office. I went home and used TurboTax and paid $89.99 for the Federal and State. I'll never bother with H&R Block again. They should be known as Huge Rip-off Blockheads!
I filed my taxes this year in February and was supposed to be claimed as a dependent since I am a college student living with my family but was instead listed as claiming myself after telling the guy that I was being claimed by my dad. I took the returns to be amended and was told I owe around $84 and that was it. Naturally, I assumed that was what I owed to the IRS because I have never had to pay taxes, but instead I had to pay for their fees even though they messed up on their end and I have to pay a lot more to the IRS which was never specified to me. I called the office I went to and after being passed on to three different people there, I never got an answer as to why I am paying that $84. I have never had problems with this company in the past, but they just lost my business with their incompetence.
I am contacting you because of a serious data security, privacy breach and due to invasion of my personal information and I’m unable to sleep or stay focused on my job. The breach of data and privacy began when the tax preparer gave my tax information to another customer. The information breached contained my bank account information, social security number, and many other documents. My consumer rights have been violated. I was told by the office manager of the tax company that they couldn’t find my tax documents. Within a few minutes, I was told by the office manager that my personal information was in the car of the tax preparer but her niece had her car. Within the same evening, I was told that my information was given to another customer - my former husband and his wife. I saw the doctor today because I can’t get the privacy issues out of my mind. I haven’t had any anxiety/depression issues for over a year; I’m unable to sleep or focus on my job. The history between my former husband and his wife has been bad blood for many years. My daughter called me last night that her stepsister asked her about some of my personal information.
In 2008 I went to my local H&R Block to file my 2007 taxes because I had recently withdrew some retirement/ESOP money from my old company and had put it in an IRA. There was a lot to be done with the taxes and I went to H&R Block because this was out of my realm of knowledge. After a few days of having my taxes, the guy said I am ready to pick them up and I got a very sizable refund, because he told me I had paid too much taxes on the money which the investor had told me it was better to overpay than not enough. So I thought okay, great. I went on my merry way and even purchased that "piece of mind" stuff with H&R Block just in case the IRS came back. Sure enough, in 2011 I got a letter from the IRS stating I owe them seventy seven and some odd thousand dollars for my 2007 taxes and my state for over 20 grand. I called up H&R Block and took the letter in to them. Turns out it was filed wrong and I wasn't supposed to get a refund. Now because of this, I owe the IRS. The piece of mind crap? Only good so many dollars. I haven't seen one red cent of that yet. I sent a letter to their headquarters to no avail. I just want my tax bills caused by their errors paid off!
I e-filed on February 7, 2013. It's April 1 and I still have no federal or state refund. First, when I filed, I got an email saying that there was a problem and to call. So I called and they said they would research. Two weeks later, they say I can't file with them and apologized. Well, I already filed so I can't just go use Turbo Tax. So I called back and it went to research again. Then they told me that it was on administrative hold. I asked what that meant and they didn't know. So it was back to research. Finally, it went through and I am still waiting. I got laid off on February 18 and I don't go back to work until April 17. I have no money and I have bills to pay. They royally screwed me. They never admitted what the problem was but I will never use them again. It's April and there is still no refund. You've got to be kidding me!
I decided to go to H&R Block because of the advertised refund anticipation loan check. I filed my taxes and paid them almost $200 for their services. I got the RAL check minus the $200 and was told that I didn't have to worry about anything else and that my refund from the IRS would go to them. Months later I received a bill from H&R Block for the same $200 amount that they took out of my refund check. To top it off, I found out that I owe the IRS $300, which was taken out of my pay checks! How did that happen? Why did H&R Block charge me twice for their services? What did they do to my taxes that made me end up owing the IRS $300?! What the hell are these people doing over there? I tried to contact H&R Block about the duplicate charge and got nothing but the runaround. The person who filed for me no longer worked there and the 3 or 4 people that I spoke to were not helpful at all! I ended up having to pay all that money because I couldn't get it fixed! H&R Block employees are nothing but idiots who are simply there for a paycheck and know nothing about taxes as the company is just a scam for money! I never returned and told everyone I know to stay away!
I filed my taxes through H&R Block on 1/23/13. They told me I would receive my refund in 21 days or less. It is now 3/28/13 and still no refund because H&R Block who states on their website that they will hold all returns until the IRS accepts certain forms (8863) sent my return in 3 weeks early anyways. The IRS stated on their website that those forms would not be accepted until Feb. 14th, because they were still in the process of updating their systems. The IRS received mine on 1/25! Because H&R Block ignored the IRS and sent my return to the IRS three weeks before they were accepting them and used the old software, some of the answers to the questions on my return were left blank. H&R Block promises to be up to date on all of its software and promises 100% satisfaction guarantee. H&R Block does not honor the satisfaction guarantee or the up to date on software guarantee. I have asked for my prep fees back several times and have been denied each time. I am now working with the BBB. I have used H&R Block for 30 years and they have lost me as a customer because of this. I am 100% unsatisfied and will never be satisfied. Sixty four days after I filed with H&R Block, I am still waiting and waiting and waiting!
I called in to a local H&R Block office and explained to the lady that I needed to file taxes for 2011 and 2012. I made it clear to the lady that I spoke with that my taxes were not complicated and that I would only need a standard 1040 and Itemized Deduction sheet for federal and a basic state return, all of which I would normally do myself. But since I needed two years of taxes files, I needed assistance in understanding how to go about dealing with the IRS, calculating interest and penalties, setting up a payment plan, etc. When I asked how much the charges tend to run, I was told that it's based on the number of forms required to file and that she would go over all of that with me after looking at my tax situation. She did say that simple returns can be as little as $45 and some returns could be as much as $500 but again, she'll go over all of that with me in the office. When I arrived in the office, I sat down and began to review with her my tax situation and was told that we should go through everything first. So I handed her my 2011 forms. She spent 15 minutes typing/copying the numbers into a computer program and then proceeded to tell me that my current charges for my 2011 taxes were $232! I asked her to please explain exactly what I was receiving for the $232. She said that I now owed her and she said that her goal was to get me the maximum refund possible and that she had gone through and located all of possible deductions for me. What happened was that I handed her copies of my mortgage interest statement and ad valorem tax (which I brought because I already knew they were deductible) and copied those into a program and called it locating all of my deductions. When I asked her if my 2012 taxes were going to be just as expensive, she told me that she wouldn't know until the forms were filed. Now when she was selling me on H&R Block, she told me that she had worked there full time for 26 years but she can't estimate what a simple 2 form tax return would cost? I don't work at H&R Block, and I could tell that I was going to be looking somewhere in the $500 range for her to take 30 minutes to fill out 2 simple tax returns and I was still not getting the assistance or services I had explained I was looking for. I asked her to please flat out explain to me how this was helping me handle my tax situation with the IRS. Her response was that "You have to file your taxes first and then the IRS will contact you and you deal directly with them." I reminded her that while I knew she would be preparing my taxes that I had explained to her that it was the logistics that I really needed assistance with and that I was led to believe a simple tax return would be in the neighborhood of $100. Her response, "Well sir, we're a tax preparation service and you need your taxes filed. You have to deal with the IRS to handle your payments." She also led me to believe that I owed her the $232 for filing my taxes even though I never gave her authorization to file them for me and she never went over the charges with me as she had promised. I told her there was no chance I was paying her $232 for what she had just done, asked for my paperwork back and walked out. An ethical business would have told me when I called up and explained that I was very comfortable preparing my own taxes, but I did not know how to go about setting up payments and resolutions with the IRS that I simply needed to file my returns as normal and wait for the IRS to contact me. They would not have been getting paid ridiculous amounts of money to fill out paperwork, but I would have left the conversation with a positive feeling about the company and would have told others that they seemed ethical. Rather, they felt that there was a possibility to take advantage of the situation assuming they would have me locked in to a $500 bill for 30 minutes of work before I knew what hit me. Absolutely misleading and deceptive business practices are not what you want to see in any business but especially not one that is asking you to trust your finances with them.
This is the first and last time that I will ever use H&R Block to do my taxes! I filed my taxes with them on February 18, 2013 and was supposed to have my refund e-filed with my return going directly into my bank account. It is now March 27th and I have yet to see my refund! Apparently, their software wasn't correct when doing the child credit portion, which I had to find out through the news rather than them! When I contacted the office that I had used and was questioning them as to when I would possibly receive my refund, I was told that I would need to contact the IRS, that they could not help me, and then she hung up on me! I find the people working for them to be rude and incapable of doing taxes properly! I think that H&R should be held responsible for their mistakes and refund everyone's fees for tax preparation, plus the interest that they have lost out on due to their mistake!
I have been doing my own taxes for years and had a great accountant prior to that. (Still be with him, but he passed away - taught me a lot!) We had a situation this year with a simple 1099-A on a second house we had to give back to the bank. I did them myself and came up with a decent refund, but I wanted a professional to take a second look as I was a little uneasy about it being a first time situation. After 3 weeks of calling to see if they were ready, he finally said we could come back. (We didn't want drop off service as we usually sit down with a "real" accountant and be done and filed in an hour. We didn't have an option nor asked for one.) We were then informed we owed the IRS $250.00. We argued and said that was impossible and was no way. He wanted to know how I came up with my figures. He wanted us to file and pay then we would figure it out. After an hour of telling him absolutely not, he said he would talk to one of his consultants who specialized in this and he thought something could be off (of course we were taking our taxes and leaving for a second opinion when he made the offer). I would think you would have done the consultation prior to calling your clients in to tell them they owe, knowing they expected a substantially different amount in the tune of a refund - $5,000.00 difference. Really! So almost 4 weeks into this with little or no time to find a real accountant, we take the new refund he came up with ($84 more than my original amount done on my own with TaxAct). No apology for the almost financially devastating $5,000.00 error he made, taking us from a $75,000 gain to a negative income. He then proceeds to file and send everything exile to the IRS. We were then informed we owed them a $600.00 filing fee. I was like "you are kidding right?!" I would expect a "satisfaction guarantee" discount. Yeah right. He gave us a $25.00 of coupon. OMG. You have got to be kidding. We took our stuff and left. We called the corporate office to complain and get a "satisfaction guarantee” claim and no one there knew anything or could do anything. What joke this whole operation is. They are sad and rip-off artists! Do not waste your time and money. We are going to take the taxes and have them looked at by a real accountant, and I bet we get $2,000.00 more. They are clueless and charge 3 times what a top CPA would charge to have it done in 2 hours as compared to almost 4 weeks with these unknowledgeable excuses for tax experts!
I've used H&R Block tax software for about 15 years and have encountered several issues through the years, but this is the worst yet! After completing the 2012 interview process, the software showed "no errors", so I e-Filed my federal return. It was rejected by H&R Block. I followed the instructions ... Start at Welcome and go through the entire interview process. Again, I had no errors. I e-Filed a second time. Again, H&R Block rejected my filing. I called and a representative told me that there was a software problem. He escalated my case, gave me a case number and told me I would receive a call within 72 hours. After a week with no response, I called and was told that it was good I called because I would not have received a call back! The representative instructed me to delete and re-enter any entry in Schedule A, line 28, and we disconnected. After checking, I found line 28 to be a zero so I called back, and another representative had me on the line for about an hour while I answered questions and tried the e-filing two more times. Then we waited for a supervisor to approve another escalation. Why was a second approval required? In the end, the representative gave me a new case number and told me I would be contacted within 72 hours. It has been two weeks, and I still have not been given a contact. I will now follow his last "last resort" suggestion ... print out and mail my filing! But the lack of follow through by H&R Block leaves a bitter taste! I tried placing this review on their website but they rejected it twice. They will only publish a good review!
My dad, my sister and I went to H&R Block on the 16th of Feb. 2013. They have messed up on my sister's taxes and my dad's. This has cost us money we just don't have and this has cost us great harm. We have to get a new ticket for the car for one more year of service and bills we have to pay with that money. We have been denied 3 times because of their screw-up! There was one for my sister and now today, 3/23/13 at 12:35 pm, my dad has been denied for the second time! This has caused my family so much harm that I need to find a job within a couple of weeks at night so we can barely get by. I will work nights and go to school in the morning with naps in between. This is just so bad and my sister has 2 jobs which have helped. They owe us at least 500 dollars and without our tax returned back, they owe us $3500 at least! My dad has been with H&R Block around 34 years since he was a teenager. Honestly, I don't know what to do or how I will pay off my loan. I have just learned that the loan for my college might have been screwed up too so, at this point, I have no idea what to do and it is killing my family. I hope there is a lawyer out there that can help all of us (on the forum) out so we can get all this money back. I'm 19 years of age, my sister is 20 and my dad is 54 and we will never be back to an H&R block building ever. Let's hope we can do something about this because this is just plain nonsense.
I did the H&R Block Online free version for my federal and was able to submit them on February 14th. Due to them transmitting a blank college credit form, which delayed my return, I just got it back today but unfortunately, it was $537 short (that is after the $60 they charged in state filing fees.). I called them and they asked me if I had an Emerald Card which I never have had. They said they took it for that. Then the lady said, "Wait it shows your card number as NA." I don't have a card. I have never applied for or received a loan from H&R Block ever. Now, they are referring it to another department and they have not fixed it. They took this money without my consent, unauthorized and now they have to take however long to process it and give it back. This is complete fraud and totally unacceptable. I need help getting my money returned to me. I also want the $60 in filing fees returned after this huge nightmare. I will never do my taxes with them or their software ever again.
My only experience with this H&R Block was over the phone, which was unpleasant enough for me to decide not to do my taxes through this company. I asked for an estimate of what a basic tax return would cost, and the lady wouldn't give me an answer. I explained that I was only looking for an estimate, and she said very firmly, rudely, and slowly, as though I were getting out of hand or I were stupid, "Ma'am, I cannot give you an amount over the phone." I'm not sure if this is their policy, or if this lady was just being difficult. Either way, I'm going somewhere else to do my taxes.
I went to a franchise of HandR Block at 6913 Cullen. I still haven't received my check. The preparers are rude. The preparers bring their kids to work with them; you cannot hear because the kids are hollering and playing. You can even hear them in the background when you call. There is one preparer who has a son that she has no control of. He is always in the preparer's face while you are trying to do your return and she has a baby that she is always trying to get somebody to hold. This location is not a good example of HandR Block. I don't recommend this location for business. It is a good location if you don't want your business taken care of professionally.
I went in to our little H&R Block in Collinsville, OK and they did two returns for me, for 2010 and 2012. We simply had a couple of different W2s and a 20% percent off preparation coupon from our local newspaper. While the accountant was figuring our taxes, we asked several times how much it would be for the overall costs, but she wouldn't give us an answer until the very end of the process (when we had already filed electronically and it had been sent). Then we were finally told it would be $550 and that was with a 20% coupon figured in supposedly - and that was for 2 simple 1040 forms to be filled out. So I guess the whole total would have been over $600 if it weren't for my coupon that saved me so much - not! That's not too bad for a total of 1 hrs worth of work. I later talked to another H&R rep and was told that they would have charged $400 and even that was very expensive. What's the deal, H&R Block? Why is there no set pricing? I thought you guys were the best, but you have only managed to ruin a lot of people's opinions of your company by overcharging for an hour's worth of work and bad business practices. It will be Turbo Tax next year or I'll just do it myself. It was very disappointing.
On February 18, 2013, my wife and I arrived at the H&R Block office in Hollywood, Florida. We provided their tax representative all bank statements, receipts, and related documents to prepare my 1040 for the year 2012. H&R Block electronically filed my return and to my disbelief, I was informed 5 weeks later by the IRS that our tax return would not be sent to our account due to an error made by their tax representative. I took my return back to H&R block and my wife and I found out that an error of combining both our son's college financial credits where done in error. This error caused not only a delay of my tax refund but a variance of $597 due the IRS. This is not a computer error. The IRS defines this as human error. I will not see my tax return for months. This delay will cause me and my wife great harm. My property taxes are due at the end of March of this year. H&R Block amended my return at no charge! But the damage is done. I paid $313 to have my return done properly and called H&R Block home office, in which they stated the district manager would contact me. I never received a call. I am not only 1 of 600,000 to whom H&R Block has caused great harm. The importance of having the job done right the first time is very important. If any attorneys are monitoring all these complaints, I would suggest class action litigation. I will never use H&R Block ever again after being a client since the age of 16 years old when I started my first job. After 32 years of using their service, you have been terminated as a tax preparer. Your employees are not qualified to represent the many that you have damaged. From students to parents from north to south and east to west, we say you're fired.
This was a total waste of my Saturday. I spent 2 1/2 hours with a tax professional, only to be told when we were winding up that the fee would exceed $600 plus additional fees for amending after a late K-1 from an investment became available. A fairly simple return for my minor child who had passive income would be more. How much more, she wouldn't say. As I told her, the guy I'd used for the past 28 years who just retired charged me $400 for everything including the amended return. This is highway robbery. When I got a call from their office to find out when I wanted to come back to finalize the return, I told them that not only was I not coming back in, but they ought to pay me for my wasted time. I'm sure when all is said and done, between my return and my minor child's and the amendment for the K-1 still not available, the fees would come out to over $1,000. Totally unacceptable. The only thing that makes me feel better about the waste of my Saturday was that their tax preparer essentially wasted her time as well. And since time is money, at least it cost H&R Block their time and unrealized fees.
I'll make this brief! H&R Block was terrible. I paid $361.50 to have my taxes filed by professionals. I waited over a half hour to be seen after setting up an appointment (walk-ins coming and going). I didn't see the woman I made the appointment with. My federal was filed, but they couldn't finish my taxes (state) because the girl didn't know how to file a Montana tax return. I had to file an amendment (to the federal return I had just filed!). I had to call them to see if it was ready (9 days later). I was given an amount of $2,552.00 for a federal refund. Then told it was $450.00. Then told the $2,552.00 was a refund for the original federal return and the $450.00 for the amended. I wasn't given a copy of the original federal return. I had to go get it and still waiting for a refund as of today 3/19/13. I called H&R and they blamed the IRS. I was not told about the problem with the education credit form (which I filed). I too paid for "peace of mind" crap! Just plain horrible process! I want a partial refund. I tried to be simple in explaining it and it's confusing, but never again.
Apparently, H&R Block's e-file system did not submit all of the answers on the Education Credit Form 8863 this year. This causes the IRS to send a notice asking for the answers and causes a delay in processing a return by 4-6 weeks. Not only did H&R Block's system fail to do its intended job of submitting all of my return to the IRS, but they have failed to acknowledge their issue. Take some ownership H&R Block!
My husband and I went in to the Covington office on Saturday to have our taxes done by Liliya. We were both very disappointed in her lack of knowledge regarding claiming a vehicle purchased from a private seller. We also did not appreciate her not adding the receipts we brought in for work expenses. My husband and I are both quite upset and questioning why we are paying to have our taxes done when the customer service was so poor. Thankfully, we had to return on Sunday to finish our taxes and worked with another agent. She was pleasant and more knowledgeable. We were able to file taxes on our privately sold vehicle with her. Due to the poor service, both my husband and I are very hesitant to return for our next year's tax return.
I have used H&R Block for 12 years more for the tax preparation security, but their prices are outrageous and they have made a major error this year with my taxes. Last year I paid nearly $400 for unemployment, a dependent, and education. I went back this year because they have reduced prices. Needless to say, it still cost me $350, which I paid cash with the understanding that I would have my taxes in 21 days the latest. Let me also add, in addition to paying for your tax fees, they also tell you to pay for an additional "peace of mind" for another $39.99, and if you want direct deposit, it’s another $39.99 (outrageous). Now it has been a month and I have not received my refund and now I am being told it will be an additional 6 weeks because of a software error with the IRS. I am expecting a full refund on my tax preparation fees since my taxes will take in total almost 3 months because of their error. I could have completed my taxes on Turbo Tax and had them already. I have called the district manager to discuss my refund and I have received no return phone call and no response from them. They are unprofessional, too expensive, unreliable, and irresponsible. I will never use them again. A total nightmare.
I have been a customer of H&R Block for several years. I've always gone to the same tax preparer in the same office for years. I was very satisfied with the work done on my tax returns until this year. I noticed that my tax preparer liked to talk throughout the tax preparation process. At the end of the day, I was billed an exorbitant fee because he took so long getting the tax return finished. He chatted and was running the meter. The "shop talk" my tax preparer was making made the clock hours increase; thus, making it look like he was working all that time. He had done so well in the past that I was willing to give him a break, but I did mention that it was very expensive sitting while he made small talk. Silently, I said I would be doing my taxes myself or going to a CPA next year. Now H&R Block has an error that causes a delay in tax returns being processed. I called the H&R Block office to ask about the nationwide delay due to H&R Block's tax form errors in software. I was told to disregard the letter from the IRS, because H&R Block was working to resolve the error and the IRS was processing tax returns as they came in. I am so upset. H&R Block won't see me again. Next time, I'm going to a certified public accountant. H&R Block is too expensive and they are full of blarney.
I have used this company for years and never had a problem. Last tax season, I had a horrible experience but decided to give them another shot because my mom had referred me to her "tax professional." Before we started, I explained to her that I do not have the money to pay upfront and I needed the cost to file taken out of my return. She said, "Okay, no problem." By the end of our appointment, she hadn't filed anything because she had someone waiting. She told us to give her a couple days and she would have everything filed. 3 1/2 weeks later, she still hadn't filed them. Finally, after relentless calling, she said she had found the time to do them and I could pick up my papers. I was under the impression everything was filed. When I walked in, she handed me a bunch of paper forms and told me that I needed to mail everything in, and she was unable to file online but didn't realize it until a month later. Then she told me to pay upfront, 300 bucks, that I told her a month ago I didn't have. So she suggested to pay half; she would give me my state returns. I could mail those, wait 4-6 weeks, get my refund and use that to pay for my federal form and mail that in. So I wouldn't even see my return until July. I was very unhappy with this. I called the customer service line. I explained all of this to them. I was to get a call from a manager in 5 days. 8 days later, I finally got a call. She told me that the woman probably just forgot that she couldn't file a certain form online and she wanted to know what I wanted them to do for me. I said I wanted my taxes filed, and I'd have no problem paying; it just needed to be taken from my return. They told me too bad, that it was not their fault that the "tax professional" messed up. I was told that I'd have to pay upfront and there wasn't anything they could do. She then told me that if I couldn't pay, I should get my W-2 forms and go somewhere else. I decided to call my "tax professional" and explained that I needed my W-2 forms because I refuse to pay for something that I could have done on Turbo Tax. She instantly got an attitude and said, "Fine, they're at the front desk." But she had the nerve to tell me to call her next year so I could come back. This has been the worst experience ever. That's almost two months of wasted time because these people have no idea what they're doing. Their customer service is absolutely useless. I will never use H&R Block again, ever. I have told everyone I know to avoid this nightmare. I really wish their HQ would take complaints seriously instead of blaming the customers for something their employees messed up.
I have gone to H&R Block for several years now to have my taxes done. I never had a problem other than poor customer service and way too expensive fees. This year, I had taxes done on January 26. The lady who did my taxes electronically signed some of my paper work while I was trying to find my Emerald card for her to see. On top of this, she reordered me a new card. I didn't need a new card; I already had one. I had education credits that I had receipts for tuition and books. She added the book receipts and omitted the tuition. When I asked if that amount included the tuition, she said, "Oh yes." A few days later, she called me, “I need your permission to pull your taxes back from the IRS. They are not going to accept education until middle or end of February. I know you told me you need your money ASAP.” I said, “Ok, go ahead.” Two weeks went by, her picture disappeared off the "My Account" with H&R Block website. I called the office, a foreign man answered, and told me to go onto “Where's My Refund.com.” I explained to him, “I can't because I don't have the exact dollar amount that she refilled with after taking off my education.” He said he couldn't help me. The next day, I'm pissed, so I went by the store. I was quickly whisked to the back of the office, where they explained that the lady who did my taxes no longer worked there and could they help me. I explained what had happened up to this point. They told me they fired her because she signed other people’s paper work, and they had complained. They rechecked my return; she had not submitted my tuition, only books. It is now March 7; I still have not gotten my refund. The manager at the H&R Block will not return my call like she said she would. I called IRS directly; the man told me there was an error with my taxes, and a letter had been mailed. I must give the information that the letter asked for and mail back. He could not tell me what the error was. I am a single mom, I'm struggling to keep my car, keep the lights on, and pay other bills that are already behind. I have to pay my mom's property taxes because I'm the executor of her estate. I'm pissed as hell. What am I supposed to do? Bill collectors won't stop calling me. Maybe I should forward their calls to the manager at the H&R Block office. I bet she would get off her ass then.
I filed using the at-home software by an H&R Block employee on the 3rd of February, and my refund has been pending since the 15th of February. The representative that did my taxes couldn’t tell me why it's pending. I then contacted customer service who then transferred me to another team who then took my info and sent it to their team in Kansas City, and no one can tell me why my refund is on an admin hold. I’ve been tossed back and forth from one place to another, and my refund has not even been sent to the IRS. I'm counting on that refund because I'm using it to put down a deposit on my first home. I feel that no one cares at this community. And this is the first time I've used H&R Block and this will be my last time.
I have gotten my taxes done at my local H&R Block for about two years now. Initially, I was attracted by the ease and convenience considering how local they are to me and how quickly I receive my return (I was planning a vacation from NY to Florida and received my return in one week on a debit type card). This year 2013, I returned to them knowing all my info was on file and figured why not? At the time, I was working 7 days a week so I scheduled an evening appointment and went in one night after work. The so called "tax professional" was uncharacteristically nervous and indecisive. I was prepared with all my paper work; however, he kept returning and re-returning to previously completed forms and "correcting" them. Keep in mind that my signature is electronically added to each of these forms, and he is returning and altering them. Is this even legal I asked? He seemed to lack the confidence and assertiveness to answer or even reassure me. He left his office multiple times to check with other "tax professionals" to ensure he was doing my taxes correctly. Eventually I was told my return was done accurately and correctly, and I was handed an envelope with my tax return paperwork including a card where my refund would be deposited and a voucher to mail in the money I owed for the state. Finally, I’m all done and nothing more to worry about, right? Of course not, an hour after I arrived home, I got a phone call from "Frank", my "tax professional" at H&R Block. He informed me there was a mistake and that he corrected it. He instructed me to return to the office during the week and pick up my corrected tax refund. Well again, having no days off, I returned a few days later to pick up my corrected return. However, the manager and receptionist couldn't find the paper work. So about an hour and a half later, they decided to call Frank. Sure enough Frank tells them he decided to mail the paperwork to my home address without ever giving me or the office a heads up. Thanks Frank, just what I want to do with the little free time I have, drive back and forth for absolutely no reason. A few days later, I received the "corrected" return. It turns out I now have two returns, two debit cards, and two state return vouchers. On top of that, there are still errors on the return, and I was charged five times the average cost that a true tax professional or accountant would charge. Keep in mind I am in my early twenties, live at home, make under 25K a year, am single and unmarried, live home with my parents and claim nothing. My still incorrect "corrected return" is now less than originally calculated, and I now owe more. There are still mistakes. I just spoke to a branch manager at their corporate office in Kansas City, and she couldn't answer the simplest of questions. She provided me with no solution and was absolutely dumbfounded. She told me I can expect a return call in 24-72 hours. So I replied, “Okay so if I don’t hear from you in three days, is there a number I can call?” She replies, “There is no number to call and not three days, but 72 hours...” Really, really, are you serious? H&R Block, never again.
She struggled with the computer program, which took two visits and then charged me over $400. This was more than I paid a CPA! This cut a chunk out of my refund check. Highway robbery!
We were given an estimate of $159 to have our taxes done. We sat for 2 hours with a tax specialist to have them completed. She was no more a tax specialist than I am! She had to keep getting up to ask other people questions during the process. She would read questions to us and if we didn't understand them, she couldn't further explain them so she would just mark no. It ended up costing us $440. We have yet to be given any explanation as to why there was so much of a cost difference. Very disappointed with this company. We called the 1800 number for further explanation and they told us we must go back to the location that did it! Then they hung up on us! We will never use H&R Block again! Their commercials are very misleading.
I have been going through H&R Block for 16 years now and sad to say, this will be my last year. They do not give you correct information. I had my taxes done on February 4 and still haven't got them. I called the office first, was told it was directly deposited in my checking account. The funny thing is, I don't have one and I had gotten the Emerald card. I got the early loan for Christmas and was told I would be getting back a refund of $799 after H&R fees and the Emerald Advance was taken out. Then today, I got told no, I must have misunderstood. The office manager is rude and just wants to blame clients and not her staff. Explain things better or get a new job. Turbo Tax will get my business next year. The last 2 years have been the worst ever at this office.
The software is giving you wrong information about form 8863. It considers the tuition and college expenses as part of your deduction if your income is under $80,000 if head of household and $160,000 if married. This is wrong. It should be $90,000 and $180,000. I found this out and called their 1-800 number. After one hour going back and forth, they said they will fix it within 72 hours. I never heard back from them. I called them back and their response was they still have not gotten to this issue, considering this is a bug in their software and is impacting a lot of people.
Easy 1040a file ended up costing me over $400.00. Time fees were added. I had two EIC and one W2 form. Turbo tax would have cost me $10.00 just for state and federal would have been free. Never again. Outrageous. It's a sin to charge that. Then they wanted to charge my 2 college aged kids over $100 for their taxes. Really? They did Turbo for $9.95.
On 2/20/13, it was discovered that someone at an H&R block office in a different state used my husband’s SS# but attached it to a different name to open a line of credit. Therefore, our tax return was shorted by $363. I was told we would hear back on 2/21/13 and we should be able to get our money back right away. Nothing. I called on 2/22/13 and was told 3-5 days and the gentleman on the end of the line confirmed that it was a "system" error. I got a phone call today and was told that I need to fill an incident report out at an office to start an investigation! My husband and I were under the impression that started on the 20th. H & R Block stole money from us and is sending me in circles trying to get what is mine, back! I want my fees ($91.70) and interest paid on the $363 reimbursed immediately. I did my taxes online and do not wish to keep wasting my time on an error that H&R Block caused. I do not wish to go to an office with 2 small kids, spend more time telling someone what happened for a 7th time, and possibly have to write it down. Their error has been costly - over 100 cell phone minutes wasted, 8 pages of online chat, my time, time away from my kids, potentially money will be spent on gas, and of course the stress of it all. Hopefully someone competent will see this and help immediately!
My tax preparer had told me not to put my $$$ in my checking acct. because I still had my emerald card from last year, that it would be free to just swipe it into my bank acct. & that H&R Block would not charge me. That’s a lie. I was charged $25.00. I also was told that H&R Block wouldn’t charge me for using the ATM. Again, they lied; I was charged $6.00 each time. I understand the bank charges you, but I was informed that H&R Block would not charge me & they did, $2.50 each time I used the ATM. I wasn’t even going to say anything until H&R Block charged me $25.00 to put the $$ in my bank acct. Also, I had an advance on my taxes, like 3 weeks before I received my tax $$ & I was approved for $500.00, they put $400.00 on the card & I was told that they charged $45.00 & that I would have the other $55.00 on Feb. 15th. I never got my $55.00 so they ended up making $435.00 off of me. Crazy. Due to them not crediting me my $55.00 plus my $35.00, this is what they get me, posting reviews on all websites for H&R Block & they will not be getting my business or anyone I know in the future. I’m glad I was able to stop 4 people from going there this year. If you choose to go to H&R Block, make sure you read all 50 pages before you sign. I really hope they go out of business. I’ve heard Turbo Tax is $15.00. That’s where I’ll be next year. Good luck to all!
We have gone to H&R Block for several years for tax preparation. They closed the office in our town so we started going to my husband’s cousin, who is a CPA in 2012. The question arose this year on the education credits and what we had taken in the past. I brought the prior years tax info to our accountant. Upon his review of our prior returns, H & R failed to give us the education credit, which was due to us on the 2009 return. They also omitted my contributions to my HSA (Health Savings Account). The 2010 return had the Form 8863 filled out for the education credit, but they failed to put in on the tax return! I was taxed on funds from my HSA account, which were used for medical expenses and also penalized for using the funds! Our accountant has filled out the Amended Return form for both years. We should be receiving close to $6000 that was due to us. H & R apparently hire just anyone and they are certainly not trained. The 2009 we may not be able to collect on because of the statue of limitations of three years. They will never receive any business from my family. It appears they don't stand by their so-called "Guarantees" by posts I have read here today! People are crazy to go there! They are so expensive! Go to a CPA. They are educated!
I work for the City of New York and was given a coupon for our taxes to be done by H&R Block for $49.00. When I called the office of H&R Block, I was told there was a cap for the taxes to be done for $49.00. When the department of consumer affairs gave out the coupons on site at Breezy Point, we were told to ignore the cap and that this was not true. But as I said, when I called the Rego Park office in Queens, I was told unless the coupon stated this information, they would not honor. I just would like to confirm if information I was given is correct and if there is another coupon out there, how do I get one?
I have used H&R Block for over 10 years and this year, I'm very upset. I filed this year with Form 8863 the education credit form. H&R Block was informed on 1/8/2013 that the IRS would not be processing returns with this form until mid-February - no date was given at that time. I filed my return on January 30, 2013 when the IRS opened for processing and was never told by H&R Block that the Form 8863 was delayed in processing. If I had been told, I could have just filed an amendment. However, not only did H&R Block not tell me about the delay in processing until after I filed my return, they also sent my return to the IRS to early. My return was not supposed to go to the IRS until they notified H&R Block of the date they would begin processing that form, because my return was submitted 15 days early by H&R Block even before the IRS announced a date to begin filing. My return was sent to an Error Resolution Department at the IRS, with a reason code stating it was submitted too early. Since my return is in this department, it has to expire from this department. It is being held without processing for no less than 32 days. H&R Block is refusing to take any responsibility for submitting my return early. As a matter of a fact, I placed two telephone calls to H&R Block on February 14th, and was told the IRS already processed my return. I would have my direct deposit in 3-5 days. I then called back on February 16th and was told that I was given incorrect information - that H&R Block had just submitted my return to the IRS between the 14th and the 15th but they were not certain of the date. It was sent out in a batch because H&R Block didn't want to overwhelm the IRS. As it turns out, that information was incorrect as well. After speaking with the IRS for over 2 hours, I was informed that the IRS did have my return and they have it since February 1st. However, it was sent to the Error Resolution Department where it will be held for 32 days (it has to expire from this department). I feel that since this wasn't my mistake that H&R Block should take some responsibility in this. My return is being delayed due to deceit on the part of H&R Block and I will never be using this company again! H&R Block would not even offer me a loan against my refund. They only told me some more deceitful information - that my return is being processed and I would have it by February 20th. I had to inform the representative that today's date was February 22nd.
I got a quote from H&R Block for my tax return, which was about $220. But after it was done, they charged me $438.75. I asked him to print out the price break down by forms. They charged all the work sheet, which were never given to me. Probably they never exist. For example, capital loss carryover, he just punched in the number, which was on my last year's return, but he still charged me $22.50. What a rip off! Never again will I use H&R Block.
I had my taxes done for the very first time at H&R Block. Before I even had my taxes done, they told me a rate to have them filed. After they got all my info and seen how much refund I got back, the price tripled and they also charged me another $25.00 to get the money on a card or $35.00 for direct deposit. They gave me no choice but to put it on a card and told me my card will arrive within 7 days. My card never was received in 2 weeks. They had to call their bank after I told them I never received the card, not yet. This is 3 weeks later and still no money back. They promise people a refund within 2 weeks after filing. After 3 weeks, I had to call them a total of 20 times and still don’t have my taxes back like promised. All I received was a text to my cell stating: “H&R Block services active on your card. This is not a funding msg. Refund timing at irs.gov.” So I called the GM at the store and she gave me the district manager’s cell number. She told me for all my trouble, she will refund my $189.00 fees back within 7 to 10 days. No problem, right? Wrong. It’s past the 10 days and still no refund like promised. I called her back again. She told me she will call me back within 24 hours with info about my refund and refund fees. She promised me a call by 9pm. I had to call her since I did not receive a call like promised. All she had to say: “I was busy.” No sorry and still no info about my taxes or return on fees. This will be my last time ever at H&R Block. I even told the GM and district manager that I have it posted all over the internet. They both replied, “So what?” Is that a way to treat customers?
I went there to fill my tax and I was eligible for a $29.00 low income tax. The guy did everything. He charged me with $290.98 for H&R Block and $54.00 for bank fees because I chose the check - without explaining anything to me. I was supposed to pay $29.00 with the coupon instead of $290.98. I will never ever go to H&R Block again.
I will never use H&R Block again. When I had a problem, I went in to the store. I was nice till the lady put her hand in my husband's face, told him to sit down and shut up and listen to her; she was talking. What a way to treat someone who just paid good money to get taxes done! Everybody, stay far, far away from H&R Block!
I filed our tax online for the first time and we used H&R Block. I tried 5 times and kept on receiving e-mail from them that our federal tax had been rejected. After 5 times being rejected and paid the fee of $114.90, we tried a different place to file our tax. And of course after not even 30 minutes, our problem was solved! So just a few minutes ago, I called H&R block to let them know that we filed our tax to Taxcarepro and got no problem. I am requesting to get our money to pay the fee to be refunded. The guy refused to get our money back; he said that we already used their software. But as my understanding from their email, “Until you correct and resubmit your return, your refund or balance due will remain unprocessed.” So this is not final and we can still get our payment back. H&R Block, we will never use you or recommend you to anyone. Thank you for wasting our time and to the customer service over the phone, he was a very helpless person.
I decided to go into HR Block to have my tax return filed - big mistake! I usually get charged $75 to file at another tax preparer. I decided to use HR Block for the first time because it seemed like a reputable company. I was astonished to find out that the charge for filing with them was $285 plus $35 to have it taken out of my return. There is no price given until the process is finished! What a rip off! I can have the same service done at another preparer for $75 with no fee to take it from the return. Never again will I use HR Block.
Having had my taxes done at H&R Block in Petaluma for the past 6 years, I was appalled and shocked to have the head office manager put the wrong checking account number into the IRS for e-file. I found out when there was no money in my account even though the IRS website said they deposited into my account, and the H&R Block computer emailed me a check deposit alert. My bank says nothing is there. I come find out why and it is due to the wrong account number. I called H&R Block to tell them about it, and the manager didn't even come to the office (it’s Saturday of the President's holiday). She let me wait for her for 1.5 hours. After that, I went home; she called me to say I would have to take care of this myself. I was the client. No apologies, just rudeness and excuses. I haven't had any company treat me so rudely. They snapped their fee before it went into the non-existent bank account. I'm supposed to track it down myself? I thought that's what I was paying H&R Block to do.
I am a single (widowed) mother of 5 children. My federal return was $338.00. I only got $42.05 of that after H&R Block took out their $261 fee, and another $34.95 fee for direct deposit. The lady preparing my return never told me what I was getting back, or what the fee was until the very end after I had signed. She couldn't get the computer to work correctly so I never really got to see anything until she printed the pages. I'm so angry! All my money that I deserved to get back is gone. I will never go back, and I will never recommend them to anyone!
Tax cut 2012: Are you kidding me? You can't copy text from the interview narrative and paste into Google to search on it. That is asinine and annoying. What jerks! Who designed that "control" into the software?
I went to H&R Block to have my taxes done. The women didn't know anything about being a new widow, and what death benefits maybe out there for me. She got up from her desk at least 3 times to ask people questions about my paperwork. I paid a lot of money to walk out of there wondering if all my taxes were done right. Did she skip something? She didn't even speak English well. Frustration. Did I really get all that's coming to me? The advertisement on TV gives you the impression these people are top of the line. Yeah, top of the discount line. Never again!
H&R Block obviously messed something up on my taxes. I have 2 Kids, and have bills just like everyone else, so this is the last thing we need - for someone I'm paying a couple of hundred dollars to, to mess up my info, especially when it only took them 30 minutes! I did my taxes 01/28/2013. Today, 02/16/2013, I got a letter saying it would be 6-8 weeks and they needed more info? By the way, H&R Block gave my check to someone else a few years back, too, and I had to wait for another one to be processed, so this isn't a first bad experience I have had with them. By the way, a big thanks to the IRS who waited till the 18th day to send me this letter. Good luck to you all.
I went to H and R Block today to get my taxes done. I'm single with no dependents and only one job, but they charged me $157! This is highway robbery. I went to them because I felt like they were a good company and always did good by me. But with all of the other places around that charge much less or many for free, this was a big slap in the face. I could have done my taxes online for free. Needless to say I will never ever go to H and R Block again and will advise everyone that I know to not go there either. Stay away from H and R Block. I hope they go under for this kind of price gouging behavior.
Agent sent wrong paperwork for garnishment to sender. Now, sender won't release the funds until other case is closed, 120 days ago. Why didn't H&R Block close other case when debt was paid in full? Have I learned lesson from their mistake? Never trust account agent from any firm. Do your own.
I went to H&R Block at Flower Mound, Texas. The lady was really nice up until the end. I was supposed to get a return of a little over $600, but the fee was $375. Really? I told her I was not going to pay over 50% of my return just to have them file it when I can go home and do it myself. She told me some stupid excuse about how I won't get as much back and even paying the $375 I will still get more back if I filed through them instead of online. I told her I would take my chances and left. I got home and filed on Tax Act Online and got over $1700 in return! You kind of dropped the ball on that one, didn't you, H&R Block?! Not only did I get almost three times as much as H&R Block said, but I only had to pay $9 for the online fee. I will always do my taxes through Tax Act Online from now on.
Stay away from H&R Block. They claim that the 1040EZ is free. Because I qualified for the EITC (Earned Income Tax Credit), it cost me $40.00. How is that free? I guess I should consider myself extremely lucky after reading the horrible and costly experiences others have had with H&R.
Scully from Carson City, NV - I too was suckered into the Free Filing by Feb. 15th - bait and switch by Feb. 15th. I submitted two W-2's to the employee which completed the EZ Form in less than 15 minutes. She then presented me with a bill of $105. The employee then explained the second W-2 being filed cannot exceed $20,000 or fees apply. This isn't mentioned in their advertising I've read. I requested my original W-2's back in order to file myself and was denied them. The filing is being held hostage until I return with 105 bucks.
I normally do our taxes myself but this year, we moved and needed a part-year return for Missouri and Arizona, and my husband is now self-employed so that creates a whole other can of worms with a home office. I tried the online program from H&R Block, but it was confusing on how to break out the Missouri/Arizona income and the section on home office deductions could definitely use more details. Anyway, like most of the other posters here, I spoon-fed all the information to my tax expert and even corrected some of her typos, including my SSN. She wasn't really sure how to do a part-year return for Missouri and originally had me owing over $700. When I told her the H&R Block online form lets me remove the income that was earned in Arizona, she fumbled around and finally found the right box to check. When it was all said and done, I owed H&R Block $521 for about an hour and fifteen minutes worth of work. When I said wow, she removed the blank estimated 2013 tax forms that she was so kindly giving me and the price dropped to $487. Congratulations, H&R Block. You lost another repeat customer because I really didn't get what I paid for. If you are going to charge these prices, you might want to at least have a staff that knows how to run the computer program!
On Jan. 24, 2013, I went to the office in Compton, CA located at 159-A Compton Blvd. after seeing the promo online regarding free federal filing. I called to inquire if this could also be done in the office for free and was told yes. My tax preparer never discussed any fees with me. He asked if I wanted Peace of Mind which cost extra and I declined. No other fees were discussed. It was just after 9 pm (closing time) and he was rushing to leave. I was also sick and needed to bring back EIN info for the fees I paid for childcare the following day. He stated everything was done and it would be finalized once I came back. I returned the following day and re-signed the forms electronically (again, no fees were explained to me). He printed my completed paperwork, placed it into a folder and said everything was done. I then asked him to see my papers. That was when I noticed I paid almost $300 in preparation fees and direct deposit fee. I inquired and he showed me tax returns bought back from clients that were done at other companies and showed me where they paid substantially more. A few days later, once I was feeling a little better, I called the toll free # and complained. I was then explained the federal free filing is only for persons claiming single w/o dependents. This was the first time I heard of this. Since the fees were not disclosed upon filing, and after speaking to more than one person regarding the Free Federal Filing, there was no need to think I was being charged. I was advised to contact the office again. I called and spoke with the manager on Jan. 26, 2013. I expressed my complaint and a meeting was set up for Monday, Jan 28,2013. She had another associate go over my taxes to make sure they were done correctly. She also explained the fees. She attempted to apply a $50 discount; however, since my return was already completed, it wasn't able to be done. I was satisfied with that at that point. The manager stated she would be meeting with her District manager the next day and assured me she would see what options could be done. She asked me to call her after 1 pm, which I did. She was unavailable so I left her a voice mail. I have yet to receive a call back. I called this evening and was advised she was in the office and was transferred to the person who prepared my taxes that I complained about. I called the toll free number and spoke with Ariana and was advised she could file a complaint. However, it would take another 3-5 business days for someone to call me. I asked for a District Manager's name for the office I used and was advised she did not have that info. H&R Block is misleading customers and not performing aspects of their jobs by disclosing fees prior to completing taxes. I did not have an opportunity to decline the service, inquire about lower cost, or have the free federal filing promo clearly explained.
Last year I went and had my taxes prepared at H&R Block. I was having problems with the federal and state taxes. H&R Block resubmitted federal and state taxes for the previous few years. The lady did a superb job, worked on my taxes for over 4 hours and I was only charged $158.00, and cleared up my problems with federal and state. Wow, they had just made a believer out of me. Then last week, I went back to H&R Block and had them file my federal and state taxes. The lady did my taxes in under a half hour (I'm retired, so they were quite simple) and she charged me $185.00 to do this year's taxes. Needless to say, I was shocked! The charge was 75% of my piddling little refund. Make no mistake. H&R Block will never prepare my taxes again!
My husband and I have always filed separately because I pay child support and we have custody of my husband's daughter. In 2010, I had forgotten to file a W-2 for 2009 taxes and needed to file it. I made an appointment with H&R Block. I was told that we could receive a much bigger refund by filing an amended joint return. We explained filing separately and that my husband got to claim his daughter. We couldn't risk having it intercepted. The woman explained the injured spouse form and charged us $100 to file an amended joint return for our 2009 taxes. The $100 fee had to be paid upfront before they could do it. We were assured that we would receive our full refund if we paid the $100 to file an amended joint return and injured spouse form. We borrowed the money from a friend believing it would be beneficial and that we would be receiving more than enough to pay it back. All of the forms were printed as well as signed and dated at H&R Block, and placed in an envelope for us to mail. We were told this was the procedure for all amended returns. We were told the injured spouse form was filed and that our refund would be mailed to our home 8-12 weeks from the day we mailed it. We mailed the envelope that very day. After a few weeks, we were hoping to receive our refund check. Instead, we received a letter from the IRS explaining that our return was not signed. We were mistakenly given the wrong copy to mail to the IRS and H&R Block had the signed copy. We signed the return and sent it back to the IRS. H&R Block's mistake had set us back to the beginning of the whole process. This meant we would have to wait another 8-12 weeks or more before getting our refund. We signed the return and mailed it for the second time. For the next few months we called the IRS to check the status and kept getting no information. All we ever received was another letter telling us that our entire refund had been intercepted. After calling the IRS, we discovered that H&R Block did not file the injured spouse form. My ex says he still has not received the money and the child support office has not given me credit from our refund. We are waiting to receive a letter to submit to the child support office in order to get credit for our refund. Because they were very apologetic, we didn't complain that we found out they had given us the wrong return to send to the IRS. We only stressed to them again that we could not afford to lose my husband's portion of our refund because he would be claiming his daughter. They still failed to file the injured spouse form. Although I am truly disgusted with this situation, I will say that we have never had any problems with H&R Block until this happened, but I can also say without a doubt that we will not be back.
No one can tell you the cost before you begin, around $199? That's the answer I got. Imagine to my surprise when all was said and done, I was charged $564 for filing, $26.95 for federal to be put on emerald card which is an H&R Block card and $13 for my state to be put on there (I had to do this because I could not pay $564 that day). This is a total rip off. On top of it, I had to tell the "tax professional" how to enter things. Where I used to live, a small town accountant did mine every year for 95 dollars. If she weren't 3 hrs away, I would have definitely gone there. I know this; I will never use H&R Block again. It should be illegal to charge that much.
I had my taxes done on Jan. 31st. Then on Feb. 8th, I received an envelope from them with my W2 and some other lady's form. Of course, I called and returned it today. So I drove 12 miles, one way, with the gas at $3.64. This is the first time I have used H&R in about 15 years. All in all, pretty disappointed.
I went to H&R Block for the first time. One family member with a 1040EZ, oh yes, this was free. However, my daughter took in a W2 and what she paid out for daycare and of course claiming my grandson. By the time it was over (less than 15 minutes), it was a 1040A form and was charged $277 for the fee. Highway robbery! There was no warning for the cost, just the bill after it was done. Never again. I have a CPA and he charges less than that and I have a business! Ripping off 24-year old kids should be a crime!
I can't believe the free online option is endorsed by the IRS! My sister earns less that $57,000, so I helped her use the "free" online route through the IRS link. H&R Block noted several times that it was free for those earning less than $57,000. It asked my sister her age early on in the process. Three hours later after she struggled with their overly arduous system and was submitted her finished return, it said it wasn't free because she was over 52 years of age (by a few months). It didn't say anything about an age limit prior to the full completion of her return. They then wanted $19.95. Next page, over $21.00 with tax, etc. This is what I call a scam. She didn't pay it. Also, I discovered later it never asked her about mortgage insurance. I later found she could deduct that. When she does her taxes on really free and easy paper forms and mails them to the IRS, she gets hundreds more back.
I walked and, of course, my run-in was with a retired police officer! He told me I shouldn't be walking in here smelling like that! I am I hardworking man coming to file my taxes and what I do on my free time has nothing to do with them! He then proceeded to tell me that I shouldn't smell that way, I said, "Like what?" And he said "Like weed!" I said to the man, "You don't work for the police officer," and he said, "I'm a retired police officer and I have police officer friends!" That made me so mad I told him that he works for H&R Block and not the police department and things became very heated! He then told me if I still wanted him to do my taxes. I said yes but not from him. The next lady told me she couldn't do it and that I had to leave! I guess it should be a crime for every stinking person who comes in there! If he wanted to harass people about those types of things, maybe he should stayed on the field but I came, like every other person, trying to file their taxes! Thanks for nothing, H&R Block; I will never file again with you guys!
I went into H&R block because I got something in the mail from them saying I could get my refund back faster. I walked into the Hicone Rd. office in Greensboro, NC and there's only one woman there. The woman took me to the desk and started filling in information. She seemed like she was unsure of what she was doing and I had to keep helping her. When we got to my 1099, she was completely lost and kept saying, "I never did one of these before." Finally an older man came in and she asked for help. Next thing I knew, she told him to just do the whole thing and she'd just watch. All I had was one W2 and a 1099 from freelance work I had done. I also have 3 children. When he finally finished an hour and a half later, he said it would be $399 to file my taxes. I was so pissed, I came up with the same refund at home but went there because I thought I would get my refund faster, only to find out I still had to wait the same amount of time. A few weeks later, I called the office to check on my refund since the IRS site said it was approved and the receptionist was so rude. She kept putting me on hold and when I tried to ask her about the RAC, she hung up on me. I called back 3 times and she kept hanging up. So I called on my house phone and she picked up, so I asked why she hung up on me, and she started laughing and repeating what I said to someone in the background. I asked for a manager and she started laughing even harder and said hold on. The manager got on the phone and apologized for her behavior then answered my question. I have never dealt with such rudeness and unprofessionalism in my life. I will be doing my own taxes from now on.
On 1-25-13, I filed my e-file AZ state taxes with H&R Block at the local office. On 2-2-13, I contacted the AZ state Department of Revenue to see where my refund was. I found out that H&R block had a problem with their software and that no e-files were being accepted by the AZ DOR. I was told by the AZ DOR to contact my local office of H&R Block and have them upgrade their software to facilitate e-files to AZ DOR. So I did. I was told that H&R Block was aware of the problem and was working on them, and I would be fixed by 2-5-13. On 2-5-13, I called AZ DOR and they said it was not fixed by H&R Block. No e-files were being accepted from them. I called my local H&R Block office and they said they were working on it. I was promised that it would be solved by 2-8-13. On 2-8-13, once again I called the AZ DOR about my refund. Guess what? No e-files again from H&R Block offices in AZ. I called my local H&R Block office and got the same old runaround I have received all week. H&R Block, I believe, is not working on the problem. As business standpoint, they do not care about you or your taxes as long as they got paid for their services upfront. With your money in their pocket, I do not believe you and I will receive a timely tax return or filing in Arizona. The Safford office I filed in is good at giving you the runaround and blaming H&R corporate for the delays. These statements are the truth. You're welcome to call them at your local H&R block office and verify my statements. Bottom line, beware. You can give my local H&R Block office a call if you wish. They're at 972-428-3748. But I believe you'll get the same runaround I have received.
H&R Block puts all California returns in a pending status. I called FTB to find out why my return was not being accepted and was told by the FTB that it hasn't been submitted yet and to call H&R Block to have them resubmit my taxes. Representatives from H&R Block refused to resubmit my e-file and yet could not tell me why. I paid for this lousy service and will never do it again. Caution to anyone using H&R Block. Don't pay for their service. It is not worth the wait.
This was my first time filing for H&R Block. I went in the office and nobody was there. The lady who was working just walked out without telling her co-workers. At first, I was getting a little worried but continued on. The lady just told me to come in to the office and when I asked her how much it will cost, she said it will be free as long as it's a 1040ez form. I was excited and went on with it. But then, along the way, it became a complex form and I asked the price but she ignored me. By the time it was done, she finally showed me the price of $175, but it was already too late since it was the end of the process of signing my money away. I'm never going to H&R scam artist. Go online and do it yourself; it's much cheaper!
I have filed with H&R Block for ten years. This year I wanted to file my returns myself since I hear simple return filing is free or at a low cost of $60. Anyway, I decided to go with H&R Block since I was in the system. I had a gross income of only $5,000 in 2012 because I came off maternity leave. So I'm thinking filing taxes shouldn't cost $300-$500 like they normally charge me with dependents. So I went down there and did a rough draft. The representative wanted to charge me $184.00 on a return of $2,000. Meanwhile, the advertisement on the office board says $39.00 for a simple return. I asked the manager, "How can I qualify for that rate? Especially because my info is in the system already and all you had to do was review it and update a few questions?" The manager said, "I don't know why they send the advertising board. It's not accurate. We charge people by the forms our company uses." Crazy. The corporate can even advertise a flat out lie. Not to mention the customers don't get accommodations for returning or a decrease in fee because of making less gross income. They have lost a longtime customer and I will not be back! I was blinded all the years, because my return was a great amount and I thought their fee amount was standard, but it's not.
Worst place I have ever been! I went in to have my 1040 EZ done (for free as advertised) and underwent the worst experience of my life! The woman who helped me, although minoring in accounting, missed 2 separate opportunities to get me a tax break that I had to remind her and walk her through the process of placing my request. I also had to correct her multiple times for address mistakes, incorrectly typed numbers and answering yes when the answer was no. Then after the two hour long process of filing my form and signing off on the return, she informed me that it would cost $300 to file my tax return - when I did all of the work and she did not even mention the additional costs! Had I known it would cost that, I would have done it myself. I practically did anyways. So much for their maximum return guarantee. Only true if that means me knowing the taxation system better than they do. It is a con scheme and a ridiculous excuse to do minimal work and take people's money.
Last year, I went to H&R Block. I was notified by a dim-witted tax "professional" that I owed several thousand dollars to the IRS. Of course, I had to pay several hundred dollars to be notified of this. I went back to the H&R specialists showing them my W4 form so that a similar thing wouldn't happen again this year. They approved the changes. It turns out that they totally didn't see that I was not being taxed for the state in which I reside. Granted, this mistake is partially because of the ineptitude of my payroll department and some would even say me, but that's why I went to so-called professionals in the first place. I went to a real accountant today and his assistant immediately noticed the discrepancy before I even spoke to him. H&R Block failed me and cost me thousands of dollars. As long as I have breath, I will yell my dissatisfaction to all willing to listen in any and all forums available to me.
During 2012, my wife did her civic duty and went for jury duty. For this, she was paid $40. On 2-1-2013, she went to H & R Block to take advantage of their offer to do the EZ 1040 for free. Instead of free, they charged $173 stating that the $40 was considered a second income and therefore we weren't eligible for the EZ 1040. You have to wonder how they sleep at night! Bottom line is, my wife, a grandmother of 7, was penalized for doing her civic duty. If we were aware of this, she would have done jury duty for free.
I consulted with an H&R Block employee to prepare my taxes this year. From the start, I was told that they charge based on the amount of schedules they have to prepare. This sounded reasonable. I am a single person, that has a home I'm renting out for the first time, and I borrowed against my 401K, etc. It sounded a little more complicated than usual. However, I am not sure how many additional schedules that would have added to the file. They didn't say. I was also charged Federal income tax for the 401K money, but when I got my 1099-R, it showed that I already paid taxes on that. Also, I bought my house in 2008, and I took advantage of the tax credit loan and was paying back $500 a month. Well, since it's not my principal home anymore, he said I should pay the entire balance, which is $6,000. The IRS web site states there are certain circumstances in which you don't have to pay right away. I hope he's looking into it since he has a lot of time because then, I was told, I could not file until February or March now. He said the IRS is holding back on certain taxes, and lucky me, I am one of them. Before that, he said I'd have to wait anyway because the IRS was not completely set up to receive taxes. What? I know people that are already getting returns. Lastly, they are charging me $364, and my return is only $600. I think that H&R block should give people a baseline figure, say $150 and maybe, of $20 for each additional schedule - just a thought. I am going to say that I'm not satisfied with the service, and I want to see if I can file the taxes myself.
The commercials on TV and radio claim free federal tax preparations prior to February 15th. I went in today and sat with a woman to do my taxes. I don't have any dependents, nor could I claim anything as I don't own property. The only thing that I could add was the donations that I gave to my church during the fiscal year. They charged me $198.49. Their sign says that the price is for complex tax returns; there was nothing complex about mine. I don't think they should advertise something and do the extreme opposite.
For the past 5 years we have been completing our taxes ourselves using online services and have never had an issue. This year we bought a house so we thought we should probably have our taxes done professionally. So we made an appointment to see a tax specialist at H&R Block. They originally stated that the return would cost between $49.99-$199.99. We were okay with this figuring that my return would be processed for free as I had no need to itemize anything. We get there and wait about 30 minutes to see our "tax specialist". We sit with her and she starts entering information into the system and gets stuck because we lived 6 months in one state and 6 months in another. She was constantly asking for assistance from the other tax professionals in the office. I really started to become concerned as this should be something that should be completed with ease. Once she had gone through the hour long process, she told me I owed them $302; and I almost fell out of my chair. I was like “for what exactly?” Now, there were two state returns that needed to be completed, but no way was I expecting it to cost $300! Prior to the appointment, my fiance went online and did a dummy return for me to have an idea as to what my refund would be. Now H&R Block was able to get me more money from my return but with their fees, I was back to what my fiance was figuring my return to be! My fiance was livid, but I said “We're here, let's just get this done.” The women then went through his information. There was more than one time when my fiance actually had to guide her to what information to enter where on her screen. It was absolutely absurd to me. All in all we were there for 3.5 hours and in the hole by $650 at the end of it all. Honestly it was not worth it to me, especially when the person who is completing your return seems to have no idea what they are doing. We will never use H&R Block again, ever.
I've been using the H&R Block free file through this IRS for years and have never had a problem until now. I get to the end and when I went to email my return, they want to charge me $53.95! I contacted my local H&R Block office and no one has called me back. Surprise, surprise. There is nowhere on the website that says Contact Us, Support, nothing. Open and honest, yeah right. I absolutely will not pay this fee. They can sue me for it if they want it that badly. It's the principle of the thing. How are they allowed to get away with this? It's deceptive and downright despicable. In fact, I'm thinking about filing a complaint with the Attorney General's office, the BBB and the IRS. That probably won't do much good because we all know whose side they're on. But it'll make me feel better.
I had an appointment and I sat down and was told to drop off my taxes instead and I would be called by the end of the business day. I was never called. Then I called the office around 5:30 pm since they closed at 10 pm and the professional had left! I was told by the manager that they were very busy. Fine, I figured I will wait until tomorrow. I called early morning to make another appointment with the tax professional. The tax professional was not even due to come in the next day when I called the following morning. I spoke to the manager again, and she began to angrily tell me that she told me yesterday they were busy before I could even tell her I just wanted my paperwork back, but it was not about what she had told me. It was about what the tax professional had promised to do, complete it by the end of the day and the following day I could come back in and discuss it. I was always taught that in quality customer service, you need to apologize for the mistake to calm the customer down and then accommodate them or neutralize the situation somehow.
I used H&R Block to file at home. The reason is when I was unemployed for around two years without even unemployment, I got burned by other tax software. H&R has been good with the software, but this year, when I bought the state with the federal, it was a bum wrap. It does not transfer what you are taxed for from the federal tax. It takes all that you have earned and taxes you straight up with that. There are no deductions, then it says you owe no money at all. Really?! It's a waste of my time and money, especially since I am going the easy way. I should have just gone to the library and got the forms and filed them from paper. Live and learn. Just keep yourself from being burnt. I am not paying $20 to ask them why it is this way. I already paid for the software. Save your money and go somewhere else for a state return.
I was at the Pensacola HR Block yesterday wanting to file my taxes. I was told that being military, I was able to file them for free and that I would only need to pay $39.99 to file my state taxes. I was already surprised it was that much. I got to the appointment early and waited a good 30 minutes until after I was scheduled to be finally seen. It was an elderly gentleman. He sat me down, asked me some questions and when we got started, he said I wasn't able to file for a 1040 ez and I needed a 1040 regular form because I had a retirement plan. And that form was going to charge me an additional $115. Then he said I could just leave that portion out of my taxes and that the IRS was probably not going to notice. What kind of company hires someone like that? Get it done right. Anyways, he continues to put my numbers in and told me that I would only be getting back $500 and that my state taxes I was going to get $106 which last year was double that. So I looked at him confused and asked him why that was. He told me it was because I made more money this year and some other beat around the bush answer. He then continued on wanting me to sign something so he could charge me the $115 + $39.99. I thought about it and nothing but red flags were popping up for me. I told him no, thank you and said I would be doing them myself. I got home and filled them myself on TurboTax and what happens? I get over $1,000 back compared to the only $700 minus the fees H&R was going to charge me. I think they are a big rip-off and scammers. Do not go there.
My dad and mom are on a fixed income. My mom is battling cancer. My dad has been filling taxes through H&R in Belvedere, IL and he was informed he owes $2,600 to the IRS. So now, mom is worried and dad is mad. He has been trying to contact the office, but they're only open during tax season. So he contacted the office in Rockford and they told him they can't help him because apparently, the peace of mind insurance only covers the main part of the mistake, but not the penalty or interest it has accumulated. Now my mom is all worried and dad is furious.
In January of 2012, we were living in Florida after moving there from Texas a few months prior. I had 3 W-2s (2 from Texas, 1 from Florida) that needed filed in addition to about $200 worth of moving expenses. I went to H&R Block and was seated with their "Head Tax Expert - 25+ years experience." He was elderly to say the least, which felt like a red flag but we proceeded anyways. Two of my returns were from serving and one was from my Human Resources salaried job. He looked at my serving W-2s and immediately told me he could not file the returns, as I hadn't been taxed the entire year on my claimed tips or hourly wages. I knew this was totally inaccurate, since I worked in Human Resources for the very same company, 3 feet down the hall from Accounting. I stepped out and called my company's head accounting gal and she laughed and told me that of course, I had been taxed, that he didn't know how to read the forms and to take my stuff and get out. I returned to his desk and politely told him there must be some mistake, as I'd just spoken to Accounting who assured me my forms were in order. He told me, "She must not know what she's talking about," and that he had 30+ years experience, etc. I told him I'd like to go home and research the situation more (aka get the heck out and find another place) so I thanked him and left. I went straight to another franchise and handed them my forms and that person told me I was missing the torn-off W-2 pieces he needed. Without my knowledge, the man back at H&R Block had torn off pieces of my forms and had not given them to me with the rest of my paperwork when I left. I went home and was very upset. My better half was even more upset and demanded we get in the car and go straight to H&R Block to get my forms back. Upon our arrival, we walked in and as I approached the associates desk, he said, "Oh good, you're back" and I responded nicely, something to the effect of not being ready to file and realized I had "forgotten" my torn off pieces of W-2 and had returned for them. He smiled at me and said, "Yes, I have those in a file for you. You'll get them back when you file." I said, "Well, I need them back now. I still want to figure this all out." He replied, "No, I'll just hang onto them for you until you're ready." At that point my boyfriend stepped in and quite firmly told him to give us back the forms immediately, that we had no interest in filing with him. He all but threw them at me and said, "Well, they can't be filed anywhere, so good luck." At that point, I was frustrated to tears and felt like no one could help me. I ended up going to a private accountant who charged me an arm and a leg, but was somehow able to file my "un-filable" tax return. Not only was the H&R Block associate's level of knowledge terrifying, but I was mortified by his removing pieces of my W-2 and intentionally holding them hostage. I found that, coupled with him trying to intimidate me into filing with him, to be downright sneaky. I have half a mind to chalk his actions up to being senile, because the alternative doesn't cast him in a very good light.
I paid over $350; however, I was supposed to pay less. I noticed an information was incorrect and by fixing it, the price would be less than $300. But they covered and made me pay the same amount. After I complained and talked to different people like Veronica from the complaint office, Josephy and Janeeth ** from the Astoria office, we all agreed that I will receive a check for $130 after a few days. It has been more than a year and what did I receive? A brochure for 100 credit toward my next income tax preparation. Do you think I would do my taxes with these kind of business/persons? No, I will never trust someone, especially whom has access to my personal info. Don't trust this company.
My 2009, 2010, and 2011 taxes were never filed by enrolled agent, Patricia ** (the EA here in San Francisco), even though I paid $200 for '09 and '10. I was willfully defrauded of this money, and I want H&R Block to know what has happened and take responsibility for her actions in this matter. I do have the cancelled checks she cashed for both years and IRS verification that no taxes were filed on my behalf. Please respond asap. Thank you.
Employee not trained properly - I have worked for H&R block for 12 years. In the last 6 years, I have seen many issues that cause errors in tax preparation; district managers having affairs with co-workers; hiring people without experience and by this, they refuse to hire employees that have many years of experience and go and hire folks that can't even speak English. Nonetheless, they don't go through training. Instead, someone does the training and saves the answers for the new ones. How unfair to the ones that really do the training.
My husband received a letter from the IRS stating that we could possibly owe $942 from 2010. I received the letter in September of 2012. I immediately began calling H&R Block offices because this is where we filed our taxes. I first called the office closest to our home, which was forwarded to the main corporate number who gave me the number of an office in an area a couple of miles from our home. I called that number, explained what was going on and was told to fax the letter and completed tax forms to them. So, I did. I waited about a week (maybe more), then called back and was told that office was closed and was given a number for an office about 15 minutes from our home. I called that number, but I could only call on Monday because that's the only day they are open (mind you, at this point it is past the response date and we still have no answers as to what we should do about this and we have contacted 3 offices). I spoke with a representative at that office who again asked me to fax all of the information to them. I was driving and could not write down the number but she said she would text me the number so I could get that done immediately. So I waited, called and the office was closed until the next Monday (still no text). I called the following Monday, got the number, faxed the information, and waited for the next Monday for a response. There was no response! I called again and got the main office who then forwarded me to another office about 45 minutes away from our home (because that office is closed). At this point, we were well past our IRS response date and concerned. I called the last office (#4) and spoke with a representative who told me to fax the information to her. I did so, heard nothing after 1 week and called back. I was again connected to the main office, who then escalated the issue. I received a callback, got a voice mail, called them back and they told me that we have to make an appointment to physically go into the office with IDs and speak to someone (Could someone have said that 2 months ago?)! After our personal information had been blasted all over 2 states on random fax machines, they would not discuss the case with me, the person who has all of the information they are requesting and with whom they have been talking to and receiving faxes from all along! It is now 1-1/2 months past the deadline from the IRS, 2-1/2 months I have been contacting H&R Block to help us. To top it all off, upon arrival at our appointment time in 2010, the preparer (** , Hagerstown, MD Valley Mall office) stopped my husband before introducing herself and asked to use his cellphone to find her cellphone. When he said he was not comfortable with that, she asked him to follow her to her car and call it so she could find it. Then after we sat down, her phone began to ring (loud dog barking noises), and she answered it! Apparently, she was selling a donkey and was yelling at her family member to take care of it. She then began preparing the taxes and receives another call, answered it (still about the donkey), and then went into a big long story about it (we did not care). We're not real sure she was paying attention to our taxes. She then confused our paperwork, misplaced items, stapled his things to mine, and when I corrected her, she got angry ... oh but not before she answered yet another phone call from the buyer of the donkey! So, 2 years later, we receive a notice (should we really be surprised?) that something was wrong on the forms and we need to respond or owe over $900.
I have used H&R Block for my taxes for several years. Even though they are extremely expensive, they have always been friendly and never had any problems until now. In December 2011, I received an inquiry regarding my 2010 return. I wasn't worried because I knew I had the documentation and purchased the Peace of Mind contract. I made an appointment, brought my paperwork in and voila, all was taken care of, or so I thought. In October 2012, I received another inquiry that included five items - one being the item I thought Block cleared in December 2011! So, I made another appointment and went back to the office. This time, the tax professional was extremely rude and accused me of losing paperwork! She thinks she finally found the issue and of course, it was Block's error but wants someone else to check it. She went on to make a big deal about how filing a Peace of Mind claim was such a process and a lengthy ordeal. That was four days ago and after multiple calls, emails and messages, I haven't heard from her. Once this mess is cleared up, I won't be back.
H&R Block filed my taxes wrong 3 times and I missed the deadline. I was going through a divorce. I filled separately head of house hold. H&R Block said I would get $1,800 back in 2008. They had to do amend twice because they forgot to put head of house and then something else. Bottom line, the store closed did not tell me. I had to hunt my taxes down by calling the nearest city. I found my taxes but the gentlemen took them home and were on vacation. By the time I got my taxes 2 months later and turned them in, I lost my refund. H&R Block told me they did not care.
My daughter had her income tax return done by H&R Block in Lynnwood, Washington at the mall since it was close to her work on April 13th, 2012. The tax preparer added two years together, 2010 and 2011, and when my daughter questioned her about adding two years together, the tax preparer's response was, "I know what I'm doing. I have over 10 years experience." Hmm, I have over 30 years experience and know not to add years together. It took taking her return to another H & R Block that I used to work at to get them fixed and it took them 6 weeks to actually do them - something that could be done in 10 to 20 minutes. I'm like floored about this whole mess. Because she added the two years together, my daughter ended up owing ... So after we picked up her income taxes from H & R Block, we took it straight to the IRS office in Everett. That was 8 weeks ago on June 16th, 2012. I went online today to look at where her refund is and one has been added to the refund amount she doesn't owe from H&R Block's mistake and the amended takes up to 6 weeks longer to get processed so it hasn't been processed. As far as I'm concerned, H&R Block should be refunding my daughter her money and waiting it out with this mess they have put her in. She will never take her taxes to them again and I told her to either bring me her taxes or go through Liberty. They are free during certain months.
On Friday, September 14, 2012, I had my taxes completed for 2011 by H&R Block at 2931 Wilshire Blvd in Santa Monica. All went well until I found out that they charged me twice once electronically and then physically deposited the payment to them in the bank. Both checks cleared my account and I cannot get a refund from them. It was $326 x 2. They are very difficult to deal with, have somewhat bait and switched me regarding the refund. I received an email from the district manager who told me that a check was being overnighted to me on 9/19 and I would receive it on 9/20. No check. Be careful dealing with them if they make an error whether inadvertent or not. Please post this. They have put me through hell.
I have gone to H&R Block for two years; 2010 and 2011 tax years. This year, I went in to do my taxes and found that I owed $8,000, which by the way I did not owe last year. Our income increased $1,000 but no other changes. I could not understand what happened. I researched and found that the tax preparer did not add one of my W-2 incomes for retirement in 2010. I brought it to his attention and he said let’s just wait to see if the IRS catches it. They did the minute I filed the 2011 taxes. H&R Block did pay the Peace of Mind however, requested me to request an abatement for the interest and penalty portion, which by the way is not a part of the POM agreement. It is the standard guarantee everyone gets. Because of the error in 2010 mistake which I was not made aware of, I continued with the same exceptions and made no adjustments for the 2011 taxes. I thought we were okay because we initially had no liability. Now after the error was found, I owe 2010-$9,100.00 and $8,000.00 for 2010. Had I known of the situation in 2010, I would have adjusted accordingly. By the way, we are not even talking about the state taxes and the penalties and interest on that. I am stilling waiting approval on the amendment which was done for state to get that bill. I have been calling them (H&R) and the corporate office every day for two months and will continue to call them until they honor the standard guarantee. I will, if need be, go through arbitration and continue to call both the corporate office and local office and visit them on a daily basis. Does anyone know if I can sue for damages? I am willing to go to court based on principal and guarantees that was sold to me when going to H&R Block (terrible service and response from H&R Block). I will do what I need to get the word out. Bottom line is I owe over $20,000.00 in back taxes that I understand is my liability however if the error was not made in 2010, I would have made necessary adjustments for 2011 and would not be in this position. I made lifestyle changes that would have not been done had I known of the error.
Upon investigation, I found out that my taxes were never filed because the H&R Block representative forgot to hit the "enter" button and send it out. I went early in March to be sure they would be done in time, because I cashed out some TSA's I owed money, which was fine I had taken that into account. However, I wasn't aware that they weren't submitted and when they found that it hadn't been sent, I was told that they were sorry and would pay any penalty/late fees when they arrived. When I called to say I had late fees and penalties for $6,000, I was told I had to pay and they would reimburse me within 3 weeks. Now I'm told that they want me to file an abatement form. In the meantime, the cost of the fees is increasing. I told them I'll pay the fees and just want my reimbursement filed, but now I have a voice mail telling me that they want to wait until after the abatement letter is completed and sent to the IRS. I feel like I'm getting the runaround, and none of this matches their guarantee which is posted online saying they're responsible!
I dropped out of the class because: 1. "Teacher" does not speak English. If she does, I do not understand her pronunciation. 2. When I registered by phone, the representative told me that I can pay 50 dollars today and the due before end of the class. In the first class, the "teacher" announced that the company policy is to pay full in advance. Who was the responsible for such a big mistake? 3. The class was not prepared and the "teacher looks" lost. 4. H&R Block announced with advertising classes in Spanish, but the truth is the classes are in English and the "teacher" will translate if a student doesn't understand the topic or idea, but many people do not understand anything the first day because the class is in English. Who is responsible for that? The location where all this happened is 7693 S University Dr., Davie, Florida.
H&R Block is the worst place to file your tax. I took H&R Block’s service to file my tax in March 2011. They took $163 for submitting the tax returns. After waiting three months, I did not get my return. I called H&R Block and they told me to contact the IRS and said that they have already filed it. I called IRS and come to know that my file had never been sent to IRS. I called back H&R Block, and after 9 attempts, I find out that they lost my information and paperwork. This is July, I am still waiting. However, the good thing is that they returned my $163 that they took for applying.
I was sent there from one of the other offices because the lady who had done my taxes said their office was not equipped to do corporations. The man who did my taxes informed me that they were due that day, so we filed an extension. That was in February 2010. Since I had not heard anything, I started calling in June. I could not get a hold of anyone at that office, so I called the other offices. Finally, I spoke to a lady who said she would get a hold of them for me. I never heard anything back. So in July, I called again and the lady I spoke to then was very nice. She called them and called me back, and told me that she spoke to a lady from that office and they would relay the message. A few days later, I got a call from the gentleman who had done my taxes and he told me they were done and the cost was $450. I did tell him that was very high since I did most of the work for him and had it all broke down in categories, all he had to do was fill in the blanks. He said that is what they charge. I told him I would be there when I get into town. You see, I drive a semi-truck so I was gone a lot. When I did get in, it was then the end of September. I called to see if there was any way they could work with me on the price, but the receptionist told me he was gone on vacation and would not be back for two weeks and that those taxes were due in August. I was very upset over this because if this was the case, why did he not call me when they were done in the first place? Why did he not mention this to me in July? I have not been able to come up with this kind of money. Times have been rough, but it's sad that no one has tried to call or send me anything in the mail to help me work this out. I'm thinking that I should go get them and try doing my filing on the computer. H&R Block used to be a good place. So now, this is 2012 and my taxes have not been filed.
I went to H&R Block in 2011 to file my taxes. Linda, the tax preparer, showed me on her screen two options on how to file: one with my unemployment and other without. Then, she told me I would get more money not claiming my unemployment. So I did not claim it; she never informed me it was fraud. This year, I received a letter from IRS stating I owed $4,000. I contacted H&R Block at the beginning and it took the manger at least one month to get me in touch with the right person to handle the claim. The lady from Block informed me to bring my tax packet and I did. The receptionist made copies and it took a month or longer to hear back from them. My claim was denied and the reason I was told was that I didn't bring my packet in, so I went back to H&R and asked her why she would file a claim without proper documents. She had said nothing so I left and called customer service. I was told to go back to the same location to file another claim, which was denied. Then, I spoke to a phone rep and was told that the lady who handled my claim noted that I wasn't providing proper paper work and when I did, it wasn't in a timely manner - when they were the ones who were not being business-like. So now, I have been trying to get in touch with the other location. I spoke with someone in that location 7 weeks ago and was told they are only open on Mondays and by appointments on other days. Since then, I call every Monday but my call always goes to 800 extension. Then, I asked them to email someone to call me but no one returns my calls. Then, I started asking for the management to return my calls, to no avail. I believe that they have dummies working there. I also feel that since the IRS takes our tax dollars, they should do more investigating when taxes are done wrong.
My husband and I took our tax information to H&R Block in March. This is mid-July and they are still not done. I have complained three times and the first time, I was told they needed more information. I took it to them right away. Several weeks went by and no contact so I called back. I was told the person who was doing my taxes had a sick family member, but was almost done with them. She needed to ask a few more questions to my husband. She promised to call the next day. She never did. A few more weeks went by and no contact, so I called and complained again. I was again told she needed to ask my husband a few more questions and would call back next day. She did not. A few more weeks went by and no phone call so we called back. We explained our difficulties and frustration and was told the person who was doing our taxes was out on an 8-week leave? We were told they would call her and call us back. They did and said "Your taxes are done, there must have been a misunderstanding." I questioned this because if she really needed to ask some questions, how did she finish? Did she just guess? We were told she would call this person and find out what she needed to know and call us back. She did not. We were told to come that day to pick them up, but we were on our way to a funeral. We were told to call as soon as the funeral was over to make arrangements to pick them up. We did call and left a message. We called again today and still have not had a returned call. We asked for a meeting so we could go over this. We feel that this is very unprofessional!
Last year, we had our income tax filed out with HR Block. They didn't file the form outright and we paid in a lot of money so we had extra taxes taken out this last year and guess what, we had to pay even more. So I told them to forget it. We went somewhere else and we found out your tax preparer was wrong and we got back the money. So they looked at last year's and guess what!? Your people had filed it out wrong. Last year, we had to borrow money and pay interests on it, so when I asked them about the guarantee, they all but laughed in my face. "Sorry," they said, "it doesn't apply to this case." I figure that you would lie! We had to pay extra money to get last year taxes redone and we had to pay interest on money we weren't supposed to owe. So if you think I will ever go back to HR Block, forget it and I am telling everyone that will listen about your lies!
Duplicate mortgage interest entries on CA State Tax 2008 - I got a notice of assessment from the state of California in 2012 for the 2008 taxes that I filed using the online software. The online software calculated in my mortgage interest multiple times on the state form, twice. Three years later, I am being contacted by the state for an error that the software made. This is the responsibility of H&R Block and the reason why one would pay to have taxes done (so that you don't have to read fine print). I know of another person who this happened to in the exact same year and was also notified recently.
I traveled 30 miles and made 3 trips to get my 2011 taxes filed. After the third trip on March 3, my taxes were finally finished. The tax professional informed me that my taxes were e-filed. The tax preparer informed me it would take two to three weeks to get my refund mailed to me. I paid the cashier $427.00. After two weeks, I checked with the IRS to see when to expect my refund. There was no record of my taxes being filed. I called the office to talk to the person that prepared my returns. I was told to leave my number and she would get back to me. I was never contacted. I made several attempts to contact that person. I contacted the H&R Block’s head office and I was informed that they would send an investigator to see what had happened to my return. I was informed then that I would get a full refund for my tax preparation fee. On April 14, I called the H&R Block office again. I was told to leave my number again. I refused to give my number and told the person that I would stay on the line until I talked to the manager of that office about my tax return. The manager was contacted. I was told that the manager said she was with a customer and could not take my call. I then said that I am also a customer, I have paid for service that I did not get, and I would not get off the phone until I get some answers. The manager finally came to the phone. She was irritated and asked me to leave my number. She said that she did not have time to see what the problem was because she was working 18 hours a day and she would get back to me. I told her I would not leave my number. If she was going to look into the matter, she would see my phone number. Later that night a person called me and I was informed that my taxes had been filed and I would get a $15 gift certificate for my troubles. On Tuesday, April 17, I went online again to check the status of my returns. Still, there was no record of my taxes being filed. I contacted IRS. I was told that I should get my returns from H&R Block and file them myself before the deadline. I made another 30-mile trip to the H&R Block office to pick up my returns. After waiting for more than 30 minutes, I was told they could not find my returns. I was very upset. I asked them to call their head office so I could talk to someone there about my situation. They refused to dial the number. I then used my cell phone to call H&R Block’s head office. I was on the phone for about 30 more minutes before I was told that they had mailed them to me. I asked when they were mailed. I was told on Monday the 16th and I should get them at the end of the week. When I received the package for that office, it was postmarked April 17th, the day I was in that office. After that time, H&R Block contacted me and said I should have not been told that I would get a full refund. That was a mistake. H&R Block does not stand behind its promises of guaranteed satisfaction.
Taxes at H&R Block - I left tax info with preparer. They had it for four weeks, lost paperwork; not in IRS database, unable to file. I had to pull any info left there and go to another tax place.
I filed my taxes on February 8, 2012 with the Fayetteville, GA H&R Block tax office. The filer told me she was new. However, she assured me that she knew what she was doing. After waiting 4 months and constantly calling the IRS to check the status, I finally received my taxes on May 3, 2012. Apparently, due to the first-time home buyer's policy 3 years ago, there was additional info that should have been filled out. I am not a tax expert; therefore, I did not know that. And now, I am out almost $400 for preparation fees.
I went to file my taxes with H&R Block as usual. Because I had cashed in an account that had some stock involved, they had to use a more complicated form, but for the young lady who does my taxes, I know it was not that difficult. Then I found out that when they filed my taxes electronically, someone else who had stolen my social security number had already filed. So the money they charged me for filing electronically went back into my checking account which by the way was 3 times more than my refund was. I think the fees they charge for filing are outrageous! I had to go down to the IRS and re-file a paper form. I think H & R Block should have refunded me the electronic filing fee since it did not go through. The next day, they took the money back out of my account. When I questioned them, they said very sarcastically, "Well, it's not our fault your social security number was stolen, we did our part." Is there no such thing in this world as being compassionate? I really feel they should have given me all or at least part of the fee back because it did not go through.
I saw on the internet that H&R Block would do small taxes starting at $275. So since I had a small business, I would try them. My bookkeeper had all the information laid out and went with me to clarify any questions. I was told it was a simple return and had a loss carryover and would owe no taxes. She filed for an extension and apparently laid it aside to take care of others. When it was finished, she billed me $745; $80 for Form 1120, $90 for Form 4562 and $275 for stat Form 600. Since all she did was plug in the numbers from the bookkeeper (and she failed to do a correction that the bookkeeper pointed out to her), I told her that was excessive. She said the fees were set by H&R Block and she had no control over them. The state form is filed out by the software with info directly from the federal info make a $275 fee ridiculous. I will never use them again and won't hesitate to point this out to any other potential client that I know.
My wife and I have been using H&R Block since 2007, but this year has really been the "straw that broke the camel's back". We went in with our 2011 taxes, got a rapid refund and they charged us over 500 dollars for it. Then four weeks later, no money, checked the IRS website and it's being processed. Two more weeks went by and we got a letter from IRS stating that we never filed for 2009. This was true, so why didn't they pick up on that this year or last year even? I mean after all, they're supposed to be the pros, right? Yea, right. Well, anyways to make a long story short, here it is 3 months later. Still, our $3500 is floating around somewhere, and get this. H&R still gets their 500 dollar cut for doing no more than giving me a headache! My co-worker e-filed in February, and got his check within a month, for free. So I hope everyone that decides to go to H&R reads all of these reviews and then do their own taxes. They should be out of business. I don't even see how they can call what they have a business and sleep at night. They are ripping people off and I have had enough. I hope all of you hard workers out there don't get ripped like we did.
I usually do my own returns, but decided this year that I would make my own life easier and pay a "professional" to take care of a task I'd never enjoyed. I dropped off all my financial records with an H&R Block accountant to have two returns prepared. The next day, I stopped into the office again to drop off an additional W2 and the accountant told me he'd have my returns done that day. I never heard from him again. Apparently, that office was a pop-up office, open only during tax season. I called nearly everyday after that trying to find out what was happening with my returns. I never reached anyone who knew anything and was promised everyday that someone would call me back. No one did. Finally, I reached a regional office and the receptionist told me my paperwork was going to be delivered to another office and that would take over a week. I began contacting that office and again, never reached anyone who knew anything and no one called me back. I kept calling everyday. On April 30, a regional office manager named Jeanette called me and said that she had my paperwork - at a third, very inconveniently located office. I explained the situation and told her that I still needed the returns prepared, but that I certainly was not interested in paying for them. She suggested that I make an appointment to come in and see her and she herself would do my return. On the day of our appointment, May 3, I trekked over to the office on the other side of town and met with Jeanette. At that time, she told me that the firm was not willing to do my returns for free, but that she was willing to give me a $50 discount. I told her no, thank you and left with my records. I still have to do my taxes!
On January 31, 2012, I went online to your live chat preparation and thought I completed my federal and state tax returns. My tax person was Linda out of Hicksville, NY. By the beginning of March, I had no return. I went back online to find out what and where my tax recorders were. No one could find my account, and it took me a while to find my tax preparer. I left messages for her to call me as well as computer messages, and she didn't. By the time I got a hold of her, it was well into March. She said, "I didn't complete the online forms." Now why she never called to let me know this, I have no idea. So, she told me what I had to finish them. Tick, Tick, Tick. It's now April and still no return. I went on the hunt, and no one could find me again. The IRS had nothing. After several days, more like weeks, I finally got a number to call. The tax preparer was no longer doing live chat, and I needed to call another number to get a hold of her supervisor to find out what happened. The excuse I received was the IRS was not computer-compatible and it was sent back to the H&R Block office. That's where it sat. The supervisor resent it, and I finally got my return around April 23. All this was bad enough, but what really ticks me off is I still paid $172.75 for my taxes being done. Someone could have offered me something for the crap I went through, but didn't. I have been an H&R customer for a very long time. However, in 2011, my tax preparer passed away; and I tried Jackson Hewitt. I came back to Block, but I won't be staying after this mess. I felt ignored and felt I wasn't worth their time. To those who tried to help, thanks. There I've vented and hope you can do something for the next person who gets lost and forgotten. It wasn't fun or worth my time next year.
April 17th, 2012 was the last day of filing taxes this year. Me and my husband decided to get our taxes done through a professional individual rather than using a software on our own. Had we known of what was coming ahead, we would have never stepped into the premises of H&R Block at 350 Rt. 3 Clifton, NJ 07015. We met **, the tax consultant, on Saturday, April 14th to do our state taxes as we had already done the federal part on our own. She asked us to drop in the details of federal tax on Monday (April 16th) and said that we can be at ease and promised that she would leave the paperwork ready at the front desk on the 17th, and we can drop in anytime to collect the papers. Being a working couple (my husband works at short hills and I work in Downtown New York), we knew we could not pick it up before 6:30PM on a weekday. We did our research on which post offices would be open till 7PM for us to be able to mail out the tax paperwork timely and we did find a location about 8 minutes drive from this H&R location. I arrived at the location at 6:30PM sharp and was ready to pick up the papers and spring out my way to the post office. And then started a series of unprofessional conduct and confusions one after the other. The receptionist was a sweetheart, but didn't have any paperwork by her at the front desk. Thanks to the tax consultant ** to trigger our series of disappointments. Seeing that I wasn't ready to sit down and wait, and when I insisted that the paperwork needed to be mailed out by 7PM, 10 minutes later an overwhelmed manager came to ask my name so that she could look up the paperwork in the back office. Another 10 minutes passed. Another tax consultant, whom I will never forget, **, came with the papers in her hand saying they were locked in **'s desk telling me where to sign and that's the only thing she did to help. Something that would have happened in a minute had the paperwork been there at the front desk and which had cost us 25 minutes. When my husband reached at that time, he expressed his disappointment not at any individual, but at how this process resulted in us not able to mail out the paperwork on time. The overwhelmed manager started to point at me and say "oh, she wouldn't have made it to the post office" (it almost makes me laugh!). She then started to narrate in a higher pitch that "we are busy and I have a daughter, I had to rush here" (I don't know how that would make us feel better). To our shock, we heard ** saying near her desk that "I want to smack his face" looking at my husband. Further to this, she stood in front of us not more than 20 feet apart yelling "do what you want to do, I am right here". We were shocked, upset, furious as we also belong to industries in which we are required to deal with customers (happy and unhappy) and people cordially. We do not expect educated, professional, ethical people to use this language on the customer's face. At least that's what our parents have taught us even if our bosses didn't. We didn't even see the manager correct her employees' unethical and disrespectful behavior. We never felt so upset and uncomfortable as we did standing there and asked the manager that we feel insulted and cannot stand in their office anymore and what we could do to close our transaction and leave. On top of all the behavioral issues, the manager guided us to look for a UPS or FedEx store, something we shouldn't have listened to as we did locate one and reached there only to know that they do not deliver any PO Box addresses! To conclude our experience at H&R Block, we paid the full price and walked out upset and insulted. I cannot believe such people are still out there pretending to serve customers! Shame on them.
I have been going to H&R Block for years, but utterly regret going this year. The competence of the so-called tax professionals is below kindergarten level and very insulting. I have never owed taxes in my entire life until I allowed the H&R Block office in Capitol Heights, MD do my taxes. They not once, not twice, but made errors entering my W2 information 3 times. After I received a letter from the IRS stating I owed over $3,000, I was outraged. I went back up to the H&R Block 2 days after my taxes were done (not knowing at the time that they were completed with many mistakes) to provide the "Manager Farrah" with this information. She was supposed to make the correction and do an amendment to my taxes. Well, what do you know, she did that wrong too! So, I went back up to the office for a third time and spoke with the new Manager Katrina **, who laughed and said, "Who in the world did your taxes? What were they thinking," which I found to be very unprofessional to say the least and this should have been my first indication to go running out the office. To make a long story short, after having a second amendment done by two different managers, I received no refund! My total refund amount was supposed to be over $7,000. Here it is April 26, 2012 and I have yet to receive all of my money. I complained to the Headquarters office and the local H&R Block office about this on numerous occasions and an E-Claim was filed under my Peace of Mind coverage. What a joke! They only refunded me $2,100 out of $7,000 that I lost due to their mistake. I have requested to speak with Management at their HQ office and they are just as useless as their employees. I will be taking out a lawsuit against H&R Block for damages incurred. They cannot keep making these errors with people's lives and not fixing them properly! I have never owed taxes until I allowed these foolish, insensitive people touch my information. I am out of $5,000 and I work very hard for my money! I do not deserve this as a citizen or long time customer! Look out for a class action lawsuit from me very soon! You ought to be ashamed of yourselves for conducting such dishonest business! Ruining the lives of those who are already struggling in this economy is the biggest insult of all!
After a fairly straightforward tax preparation, involving 4 W2s and the sale of a house, I was presented with a bill for $630 for 70 minutes work. That's more than 50% of my refund. Their website shows reviews and praise, but no place to take my review or express a concern. What a rip off.
I went to H&R Block for my 2009 taxes. I guess I was audited for that year. I went back to H&R block for help. I have been the one dealing with the IRS for my refund from this year. Even when I went into their office, I was the one put on the phone to still deal with the IRS issues. I have sent in all required documents, and I’m still getting the run around treatment. I need help in resolving this issue, and have paid for the service of in case I get audited. They have not stood behind their insurance on this. What can I do, I really could use this refund now.
We received notice from the IRS regarding our 2009 federal taxes saying we owed $550 additional taxes. We pulled out our 2009 taxes and noticed a mistake was made by the tax preparer. We tracked down the tax preparer as he had since left H&R Block because he felt guilty with the outrageous charges. He wrote a letter stating he made the mistake. We took the complaint to the highest level available to us. They informed us they would not pay because we could not prove that we did not estimate a 1099 amount. They charged us $643, which really blew us away. It took about 30 minutes to prepare. We were outraged and decided not to use them the following year. The bill would probably have been $1000. We also purchased the Peace of Mind plan, which was another $30. We will never use them again and we will tell all friends, relative and co-workers not to use them.
My husband and I went in to file our taxes with H & R Block. We made an appointment, went in and had to wait 15 minutes because our person was late. Then we get our taxes done, W2's and 1099's. We filed a 1040, not complicated. We spent 1-1/2 hours doing the taxes, not once did they find any extra money for us that they keep showing on their commercials on television. When we got finished, we owed IRS and then we were told it would cost us 510 dollars for their fee. It cost us more to pay them than what we owed IRS. They made a courtesy call to us and I told them that we wouldn't be going back to them because they gouged us.
In late March I knew I was getting close to the deadline to getting my taxes done. For years I have gone to a local CPA business where the preparation has cost me $120-150. I am a single mother, have two children, one job, don't own my house, and have tuition interest. Since I was running late in getting them done, and I know the CPA firm gets busy, I decided to go to H&R Block to get them done. Mistake. On their wall they have a range of prices and it appeared, with the simplicity of my paperwork, I would be paying approximately $200 or so. Okay. The preparer was very nice and she got through everything and went to get the bill. She brought it back to me and I told her I was very disappointed with the fees and she told me they were close to what other agencies charge. I calmly disputed that with her for a bit and said that I was not prepared to spend that amount of money. She said, "I will let you work the charge out with the receptionist." What? I asked her and the receptionist to provide me with the details of why the charge was so high and they could not do it. They kept avoiding me. No one informed me that I could walk out without paying and not have them file my taxes. I still do not know when she hit the button to file them. I ended up paying, with two different forms of payment because I thought I had received the service and was legally bound to pay. Upon leaving, I immediately called the customer service line to complain. The serviceman said, “Didn't they tell you that you could leave without paying and they would not file your return?” No, they did not. He stated he would send the complaint up to the district and they would get back to me in 3-5 business days. Six business days later, someone called me. I asked her if she could explain to me why the charges were what they were and she stuttered as she attempted to try to give me some sort of reason, saying that 18 forms were filled out for my return. She also eventually said, "I see a schedule C on your return, which, depending on the complexity, could vary in cost." She explained some of the items in the schedule C, which is for business owners! I clarified that schedule C was only for business owners or contractors and that I was only employed by one employer and I should not have that form on my taxes. She indicated she would have to look into things and call me back. The next week, I got a call from their escalation team telling me that, "No, there was no schedule C on your return." Well, then why did the last individual tell me there was? She stated that, “Everything looks like it was done correctly and we see that they did give you a $20 coupon, so we can't refund any of the charges." Dear, the $20 coupon was thanks to me, because they were doing a food drive and said that if I brought in 5 non-perishables, that I would get $20 off my bill. I asked her about my right to leave without paying or having my return filed, and she said, "Well, that is why we always have our customers pay prior to their return being filed." I explained to her that is not what happened in my case and that my preparer was already on to the next customer when I was still trying to talk to the receptionist about the charges. She said she would call the office and call me back. Days later she called back and said, "I talked to the office and they said that they offered you the option to have the charge taken out of your refund and you declined." Of course I declined... I was still trying to decline paying the charges in the first place. I inquired about what the 18 forms were, that were included in my file. She said there were only 14. I had her give me the breakdown over the phone, leading to a grand total of $364! You have to be kidding me. I am a single mother, with two children, working and volunteering in my community, and you are ripping me off! They aren't just charging for the forms that get submitted to the IRS, but also for the calculations and worksheets that "they use" to get the numbers. She plugged a total of maybe 7 numbers into their system and it figures it out for them. Give me a break. It is horrendous that we allow this company and others like it to stay open, and we allow them to continue to deceive the American people. H&R Block, you should be shut down and completely ashamed of yourself. I will never engage in business with you again and will do my best to inform others of your disgusting greediness off of the American public.
I prepared my tax return online using the H&R Block’s "free" version. When I completed the return, I was not allowed to print or file the return without paying $34.95. I have reviewed other complaints that confirm that this happens to many people who use this "free" service. What a scam. I would be more than happy to have an attorney contact me. I find this outrageous and they should be punished for their unfair and deceptive practice.
H&R Block charged me $400 to file as a single with 1 dependent. Not even close to the advertised rates on the wall. The worst part is that even though I had given the woman the W-3 for my nanny, she did not calculate the Schedule H for the nanny's Medicare and SS taxes. I found that out when I checked through my return last night, just to be extra sure. I called and the guy had no idea what I was talking about, kept talking about my deductions. So, I went back today in person and it was the same guy telling me rudely that it was my responsibility. I can't pay that with them, yada, yada, even though I explained that it was supposed to be part of my original return and needed amending. I said please, I don't want to be delinquent in my nanny's tax payments and get a penalty, I paid $400 for this, it should be correct, and I also paid the extra $35 "peace of mind" garbage. His response was, "you didn't pay me $400." He told me fine, talk to the manager. The manager came over and was a little nicer, but even he had to go google what a Schedule H was. You are a CPA? So, he and the first guy went back and forth. The first guy apparently didn't know how to file an amended return. Really? So the manager did it himself, and even he couldn't figure out some of the fields on the computer form. I was telling him, no, it should be X, you only count the first $7,000, etc. If I had not done as much research as I had, I don't know what they would have done. So now he won't submit the amended return (which includes my tax payment due today) until he talks to his boss in a couple of days. So he can make sure he did it right. This is freaking ridiculous. I have used their online services for 4 or 5 years, but this year it was more complicated so I went in person. I’ll never use them for anything again. Like what others have said, they are cheats, but also rude and incompetent.
I went there after I saw their advertisements. I expected that I would end up paying less than $150 for a fed and 2 state returns. I was implying that this company employs tax professionals with better knowledge than others. As we were going through the pages on the software, I soon realized that the person I was discussing my taxes did not have sufficient knowledge. He did not even know how to deal with 'V' items in the box 12 of W2. He made a major mistake by filing a 1040NR form instead of the regular 1040, which is why they could not e-file my fed and state returns. Moreover, he added the amount mentioned in the box 12 to my income saying it's not included in the box 1 on W2. I doubted it, he was also not sure; still he insisted as he knew better. Today, when I checked, I realized I was right. Box 1 has all the income, including any stock option money mentioned in the box 12. By doing this, he increased my taxable income beyond what was actual. At the end, I was told that I had to pay $349 in fees! They said, it's 1040NR (as if it's a very, very special and rare form), so I had to pay this amount. He's is insane. This was way more than, at least 125% more, they advertise. Summary of my experience: 1) Filed a wrong form; 2) Incorrectly increased my taxable income (due to lack of knowledge); 3) Charged me $349, more than what they advertise. I really want to amend my returns, and refund me any money they charged extra by filing a wrong (1040NR) form. I would never go to H&R block again. I am totally disappointed by their professionalism, integrity.
My husband was unemployed for 7 months in 2011. He took a job at Trader Joe's just for health benefits (we were paying almost $1,000 per month in COBRA expenses). I am self-employed as an actress and performer. However, I was pregnant during 2011 and unable to perform. We made less than $40,000 - AGI $24,000. My husband thought that it would be cost-effective to use a large tax corporation like H&R Block rather than a private CPA firm. Several such firms gave us quotes ranging from $275 to $500 - mostly flat fees for the preparation. After several appointments with H&R Block (where the woman working with us initially said that she couldn't give us an exact fee as the fees are based on "forms filed," she did say that it could be as high as $400, I should have walked away then! ), we were slapped with a bill for over $700! I nearly started to cry at her desk. Yes, it is April 17, and yes, we did wait until the last minute to file this year for several reasons. But I find it unconscionable that a young family who made practically nothing in 2011 can be charged that amount of money simply because of "all the forms they had to fill out". That is part of preparing a tax return! When I attempted to talk to the woman about it, saying that my parents just had their taxes done with a private accountant for $275, she responded, "Well, their taxes must be simpler than yours." Both parents have regular W-2 jobs as well as 1099 work and their own business. Simpler?! I highly doubt it. I will never use H&R Block again. Disgusting!
I've been using H&R Block/Tax Cut software for 10+ years. After this year, no more. I don't even know where to begin with this, but it's obvious the H&R Block software development/design team have no clue what they're doing. I should have known when I came across the following errors that there was going to be trouble. For starters: In previous years when I've done my taxes with H&R Block tax software, I was always prompted to enter my property taxes for my house, but not this year. I had to hunt and search for the field to enter my property taxes. Thank goodness I knew to look for this and caught this before I filed because it made a $3k difference in my tax return! I also ran into trouble when I noticed I wasn't prompted when I stated I started a new job in 2011. You can write off certain job hunting expenses associated with searching for a new job (I remembered this from a previous time when I switched jobs). However, the H&R Block tax software did not flag me to enter my job search expenses and again, I had to hunt and peck for the fields to enter these cost in as well. Again, this also made a little bit of difference in my tax return as well. Then when I went to file my taxes, I was prevented from e-filing them for the first time in 10 years! I actually had to print my taxes out and mail them in which shocked me and the reason was because I had gotten married, but was filing separately and because we live in a community property state the IRS won't allow you to e-file those returns. However, the H&R Block tax software kept prompting me and requesting that I e-file my return. I finally had to email the H&R Block techs to tell them to stop sending me reminders to e-file, which they did, but being someone who comes from an IT background, wouldn't this be a glaring issue that should have been resolved during software testing? Just saying. So working through all issues aside, I finally submitted my taxes early because I knew I would be receiving a tax return. However, what I didn't know is that the H&R Block tax software had one more issue up its sleeve I was about to discover that was going to come back to bite me in the backside and that issue came to light when my husband went to file his taxes using Turbo Tax and was flagged to enter my W2 information on his return because we live in the community property state of WA and according to the IRS, when you live in a community property state like TX, WA or CA, you have to combine your income with your spouses and divide it in half when preparing your taxes married by filing separately! That's a valuable little nugget of information to know don't you think when designing/developing tax software? I was shocked. I called the IRS to confirm this and they said yes, this is how you have to file your taxes when you're married living in a community property state and since I had already filed my taxes, I now would have to submit an amendment! I contacted H&R Block to raise awareness to this huge gap in their software design. The response I was given was that they were sorry, but "they can't cover every specialized tax situation". Interesting I said, especially when your competitor Turbo Tax does! I told them that had it not been for my husband filing his taxes with Turbo Tax, we never would have known about this and that this is going to be a huge issue for all these married couples who are filing separately in community property states using H&R Block tax software to prepare their taxes. H&R Block customer service went on to tell me that they were sorry, but they couldn't help me since their software does not support this situation on their online tax amendment form. They then told I would have to go into one of their H&R Block offices and have one of their accountants do my amendment and that I would have to pay them to do this! Really, I said. Are you serious? I said, so let me get this straight. H&R Block, whom I have already paid $45 to use their online tax software, are telling me due to the shortcomings of their own software say I now have to pay one of their accountants in one of their H&R Block tax offices to do an amendment on my 2011 tax return that they screwed up? Absolutely not! I requested a refund for my H&R Block tax software purchase and was told that because it had been over 60 days since I purchased the software, H&R Block could not refund my money, that I would have to mail the receipt to their Corp HQ to request a refund. Unbelievable. So as I promised the H&R Block customer service rep, the aforementioned review is going to be wallpapered all over the internet for those to see. For those of you who are married, living in community property states who are filing separately using H&R Block tax software, don't let H&R Block give you excuses that it's not their fault when the IRS kicks your 2011 taxes back to you and request you file an amendment that this is a "special tax situation" and they didn't know about this, because this is a known software gap issue that H&R Block has to resolve, especially since their competitor got it right. After all, community property states (LA, TX, NM, AZ, CA NV, ID, WA, WI) have been around for years and didn't just pop into existence as of 2011. Serious fail on H&R Block's part! Thank goodness my husband used Turbo Tax this year to do his taxes, otherwise, I would still be in the dark on this matter and blindsided when the IRS contacted me. Good luck everyone!
It has taken me all day sitting around trying to file my return and the website message keeps saying, "You have tried 3 times to sign in. Wait 20 minutes and try again." And I waited only to keep getting the same message even after they emailed link with info. It’s so frustrating. They claim it’s free but charge for state return before printing last year.
Unbelievable charges, definitely robbed & not pleased! - I have an MBA, and am one of those 24 million underemployed/unemployed professional folks out there, working 2-3 restaurant jobs, and whatever else I can do, to pay my bills legitimately. I have never paid more than $150 for a long-form itemization of my taxes, and that is for many years of filing the very same way, in several states. So I moved to NC last year, and needed to file a state income tax in addition to the federal. Okay, fine. I'll pay another $50 or whatever... that seems reasonable enough - no. After the 1.5 hours of time involved in inputting/printing/signing, I was told that my fee was $415.00! What? You must be joking! I did not have the money beforehand to have my taxes done sooner, figuring on the approximate $200 fee, and could only now (this past Friday, 4/13/12) do them, but after getting the appointment and doing the taxes forms, she told me that I can walk away, but have wasted her time, and sorry, she should have told me beforehand what it might cost. Well, what was I to do at that point? I don't know anyone else to use since I am new to the state, and with only 4 days left to file (without filing an extension). I felt betrayed, and I literally cried at her desk. I only made roughly $15k last year, way, way less than my almost 6 figures years ago. But it's been over 4 years since I was employed full time and I am on food stamps also. H&R Block feels that it is justified to charge this amount of monies? Really? I am not a corporation - just a single taxpayer. Unbelievable! I will file with the BBB in Missouri. I think that's where their corporate office is located. And I am also going to do whatever else it takes to seek justifiable recourse of my actions - why is it that these companies are allowed to prey on folks? Please let me know if there is anything that I can do to help myself out of this mess that I unknowingly created for myself. It is surely appreciated. Thank you for your time.
Simple, today 4-14-12, my wife and I had our personal income taxes prepared by H&R Block, as I have done for many years. Our return was identical to our previous years’ returns, which cost us $290.00 for 2010 returns (which was nearly 30 more expensive the prior year, 2009). This year, we were charged $494.00 for our 2011 tax return preparation. This is an absolute outrage and completely disgusting! These were not the rates advertised on the wall! If they are going to raise their rates by such a margin, they should have to tell you this in advance of preparing your taxes! Just hours ago, I took my returns to my parents’ accountant who handles their tax preparations and I was told that this should have not cost me any more than $250. I feel completely taken advantage of and am absolutely disgusted with this company and its misleading business practices.
I am 57 years old and have been filing taxes for years! I have never ever spent more than $100.00 to have our taxes done and we have always gone long form. We just moved to Houghton, Lake Michigan and saw that there was an H&R Block at the end of our street and decided to give it a try. The lady there charged us $280.00. I came home and cried because we are now down to one income and it took a huge chunk of money out if our daily living expenses. All I want to know is how you guys can sleep at night knowing you charge more than a fair price. I still cry every time I think about how we would spend $100.00 and ended up with $280.00. I will never use H&R Block again nor recommend them. The day we came home after having to pay that, I actually think I started having a heart stack due to stress but knew I couldn't afford a doctor visit after that so I just went to bed and crowd the rest of the day. I know none if this matters but I just had to get it off my mind.
We have been dealing with your tax service for years and that is about to end. Having our taxes done this evening and getting a statement for $402.00 for less than an hour’s work and not to be told until after the service is done is ridiculous. We are not even middle class any longer and businesses like yours take advantage of people because we have to get taxes done. When I tell people what we were charged they are even surprised. First thing they say is that we are paying for the advertising. I am beginning to believe it. Some of these folks are business owners and somewhat wealthier than we are. You should be totally ashamed of your tactics. At least let people know how much your services are. I am on disability and a Vietnam vet that fought for this country and I am sick and tired of these types of business tactics. My family will be looking for a new service. When you have a service done, don't you know what you’re paying for? The amount you charge is outrageous. At least we would have the option to decline.
Well today, April 13 2012, I went to pick up my taxes and they won't give them to me because they wanted $520 to file them. Are they kidding? I have to pay in and they are trying to screw me. I have to file for a suspension on them so that a regular tax person can do them, they usually charge $120. I dropped my taxes off in February. I didn't hear from them at all and I just assumed they would call if they get done. But I went to pick them up and found I can't pay that. So I have to say, these are crooks in my book, I will never try them again or recommend them ever to anyone. I am mad as hell.
Very, very, very dissatisfied, worth was not even close to what they charge. I could have done it myself and been better off. No savings at all. All that old girl could say was, you have to pay. I would have been much better off going to Walmart. One of my businesses she would not even write it up for me. This old girl was a school teacher, sold out to the government. When I would ask about what we had claimed, she did not want to tell me. I got people waiting, you got to go. What a joke, their office was always empty. H&R, you got me this time but never again. This is the worst I have ever been ** doing taxes. Oh, did I tell you I don’t like H&R Block. H&R Block is a **.
First off, this is the very first time in my entire life that I've had to pay in taxes. The woman who assisted us at H&R Block e-filed for us, without adding my son as a dependent. But because she had e-filed it, without even giving us an option to wait before it's filed, we had to wait for the State return to come back before making an amendment. It should be noted that my husband and myself were in total and complete shock at owing the government nearly $3000 when we've never, ever paid in before, so we should have been given an option of waiting for a day or two to go over our own paperwork before everything got filed. I just can't see why she immediately filed our taxes when she saw all the blood escape from our faces when she said we owed money, when we make just over minimum wage! There is something really wrong when you don't have anything but now owe money on top of it! So, we had to wait for the State return to come back before we could amend the original return. That was on 1/15/12, and the State return showed up on 03/19/12! Now, we go back to H&R Block and a new guy files the amendment for us, but fills out the amendment as though we had already paid the IRS, which we told him we had not done. Our paperwork shows that we overpaid the IRS when we have not paid them anything, but wish to work out a payment plan. Why he filed the amendment out in this manner, presuming we paid the full amount that H&R Block said we owed, when we planned the amendment 10 minutes after filing the first time? We don't know! He was no help either. My entire experience with H&R Block has been a wash. It's been horrible, terrible, and I will never, ever go back. This is the first and absolute last time I go the "Tax Professionals" who know even less than I do, and this is their job! I called this afternoon to ask what the actual total amount I owe is since it's not on the amendment, and the woman there said I don't owe anything. The IRS owes me. Mind you, I explained that on line 17 of the amendment, the H&R guy filled in we had paid the government; however, we had not yet. She still didn't get it. After being on the line with them, and speaking to several incompetent people for approximately 10 minutes, I am through. The entire situation with everyone in this office is utterly ridiculous. Where do they get these people from? I had to repeat over and over the clear story and speaking very slowly, that we never paid the IRS yet, that we waited for the amendment, and are now getting a hold of the IRS ourselves and I just needed the total amount due. She apologized probably for being too stupid to deal with the average American consumer when she is the tax professional who couldn't even fathom the issue. Never use H&R Block. Do it yourself and save yourself all this stress!
Website issues and clueless support - I filed last year online and overpaid for the convenience of filing online the day before tax day and I made the mistake of waiting too long to file this year. Luckily, I did not wait until the day before because it's taken me countless hours and 2 trips to the storefront help centers to finally get my taxes filed. I used the "free" version for Federal, which resulted in $63 in fees. I was involved in 2 different online chats to try to resolve error messages. I kept getting on the faulty website, totaling 4 hours to get it all done and that didn’t include previous sessions working on it. I have very simple tax paperwork. Simply plug in all the info when prompted and you're ready to file! Sounds easy, but their website made it near impossible. I'll never use it again.
I used H&R Block last year, and they charged me $110.00 for a long form tax return. So I decided to use them this year. The person I used was foreign and had a thick accent that I could barely understand. She made no suggestions for any tax credits that I may have gotten, and at the end, she charged me $331 for the very same service or less than I had received the previous year, because she said they were under new ownership and that I got a break last year and it was actually less than last year. How is $331 less than $110.00? I have been having my taxes done for years and never had to pay this much. If it is under new ownership, they are robbing people blind with people who are not even certified accountants and have no clue how to really help you with taxes. They are just out to pad their own pockets off the money you pay to Uncle Sam! In other words, they are virtual crooks. I will never use them again.
I was preparing my taxes for the first time online through H&R Block and I thought it's a little confusing, so I booked an appointment with a tax rep to get a better sense of what was what. The prices were clearly posted on the wall behind the check-in counter and I expected to pay $99 for a regular 1040 with no dependents. I am a student not living with my parents and I make $14,000 between two jobs. Based on my roommates in my similar situation, I was expecting to get a good amount back on my return. After 15 minutes of the tax rep telling me about the other services they offer and 10 minutes completing my taxes (they were mostly filled out from when I attempted H&R online), she told me I owed $100 on my federal. I asked her if there was a mistake because I should be getting money back after my school tuition credits and based on the amount of money I made. She insisted it was correct and luckily, another tax rep walked by and noticed she classified me as self-employed and we were able to change it before filing. We went over everything one more time and after having to correct the tax professional's number inputs several times, we finally finished and I received $240 on my return. Without telling me an "adjusted" cost, we filed and I went to pay what I owed for their services. I was told I owed $186 (it's not a lot compared to some of the other stories I've read, but living on my own, making what I make, I really don't have the extra money). I asked for an explanation for the adjustment in cost and I was told my case was "more complicated than usual" (mind you, I didn't itemize or have any additional forms). I felt I was taken advantage of filing my taxes for the first time and if I knew there was the option of walking out before filing, I would have after the first several times they messed up. I am very displeased with the service provided and plan on filing an official complaint with the company.
I had my taxes done at H&R Block in New Mexico, and I was charged $268.30 + $30.00 for peace of mind (more like peace of nightmare) for a total of $298.30. They filed and told my money would be in my account by 04/09/2012, both federal and state refund. I waited 45 minutes to 1 hour past our appointment time to begin taxes. Now, mind you, had H&R Block done my taxes 7 years a on paid a high rate. For the past 7 years, I had a CPA do my taxes for a much lower fee, and I always got my refund on time, taken at my appointment time and never had a problem with it at all. I moved to NM and decided to give H&R Block another chance. Boy, that was a mistake. The tax preparer, I found out, put the wrong account number in file. I didn't get the refund on the 9th. Now, it will be 6 weeks more before I receive federal refund and 6-12 weeks before I get state refund. I called the office where I had it done, since this is now 04/11/2012. The office manager laughed and thought it was funny. She told me she would call her boss and have her call me. There's no call. I went to the FB page of H&R Block, emailed, and got a call. I was supposed to hear back in 3-5 days. Never, never, ever will I deal with H&R Block again!
Me and my husband filed our taxes yesterday and after learning we owed the government, we also were charged a hefty $243.50 for filing a very simple tax return. So we ended up paying almost $500! By Facebook, I was told that one is charged based on the "complexity" of the taxes filed, but this is a blatant lie. We have been loyal customers for years but no more, we are done with this company. They are in the business of taking advantage of their customers specially now that the whole country is undergoing dire economical turmoils.
I was told it would be around or "at least" $300. After 2 1/2 hours, I was told I owe $870.50! I walked out. They said I did not have to pay for the tax preparation, but that I wasted their 2 1/2 hours. What about my 2 1/2 hours! What a horrible, horrible, deceptive company. I called the 800 phone number but was given the runaround, so I couldn't even report this. I guess it's because it's acceptable practice to the corporate office.
H&R Block has outrageous charges. I made $11,000 last year. I went to H&R Block and sat there for less than 30 minutes and they charged me $310.00. This is the first year I have filed without my parents. Never again! That was a learning lesson!
We have had our taxes done at the same H&R Block for 10 years. I was appalled when I went to get my taxes done, and on the counter they had literature to vote for an area politician. The problem is, he is running against my husband. When I questioned the manager (whom I have never met) she was very snotty and flippant. Do you not think it is strange that you have no problem taking our money that we make from our jobs and then support someone openly that does not use your business?
Horrible Service, Overcharged - I am an American living in the Netherlands. I have used the 2020 K St. NW Washington DC H&R Block to file my taxes for a few years, mainly online, but recently through a tax agent in the office. I am very unhappy with the service I received from the H&R Block tax agent and office manager of the 2020 K St. NW Washington DC office. It has taken over 2 months to file Federal and State tax returns, and the charges totaled $435. I filed a complaint with H&R Block on March 18, 2012. I am also dissatisfied with the duration of the complaint investigation and results of the complaint process with H&R Block. It has taken over 3 weeks to come to "resolution". Further, I have no confidence my taxes have been done correctly nor any assurance they were reviewed by anyone other than Mr. **. Most amazing still, I must continue working with Mr. ** to ensure my taxes are actually filed electronically. Every aspect of this business transaction demonstrated negligence by H&R Block - from the first 2 weeks of Mr. ** becoming my tax agent to "resolution" authorized by the district manager, no reason was provided to me. Over the past 2 months, Mr. ** has been unresponsive, made errors in my tax returns, and did not provide information that I requested. He yelled at me over the phone when I questioned why it took over 2 months. It has taken H&R Block complaints department almost 3 weeks to have resolution to my official complaint (filed March 18, 2012), and the only resolution was a $100 coupon that the offending agent was responsible to enter into the system on my behalf (and still has not been applied to my account). I have no idea what other actions resulted from my complaint, if any. I have documented every step of the business between ** and myself through emails. I sent all those emails to his district manager. The emails show I gave all the required tax information to Mr. ** to file my taxes in the first week of February 2012; yet my taxes were not completed until March 18, 2012 - and not filed as of April 5, 2012 because H&R Block did not resolve the matter in a timely fashion. H&R Block 2020 K St. NW Washington DC 20006 should be ashamed that this happened and how it was handled, both by the tax agent in charge and the resolution department. H&R Block should refund/negate the full cost of filing my taxes.
My daughter is a college student and had a part time job. She only made $7,538 in 2011. She has a checking account where she received 6.35 in interest. She went to H&R Block in Morehead, KY to get her taxes done. They spent a total of 22 minutes doing her return. They charged her $377.00 to get her taxes done. She asked them why it cost so much and they told her that it was what they charged to do a return like hers. Since she had never had her taxes done before, she didn't know that she was being overcharged or that she had the option to leave without having H&R Block complete her taxes. H&R Block never told her that she could refuse to pay them that outrageous fee and leave. When we went back the next day to confront them on the charges, they said that she had already paid them and the taxes had been filed, so she had no recourse. The agents at H&R Block were rude to us and told us to leave. My mother worked for H&R Block in the 1980's and she was appalled to hear that they had charged so much to a student that had no tax liability. H&R Block is the most awful company that I have ever dealt with. They will never get any business from my family, friends and anyone else I can tell about their absurd charges and poor business ethics.
My husband is self employed and made less than $30,000 this year. I was not working this year so my income wasn't even included or an added form. He had all of his information ready and all of his deductions. The woman who met with him took only 30 minutes and charged $400! We are so upset.
I called the year round H&R Block in Nampa, ID to ask what their fees were. After answering a few questions, I was informed my fees would be around $80 for both state and federal as they classified me under the simple form. I arrived to their office at the scheduled time, waited 15 minutes before someone walked up to apologize and inform me that my consultant was running behind and it was going to take additional 10-15 minutes before I would be seen. I was unable to wait and scheduled my appointment at a different H&R Block location in downtown Nampa. I was pleased with the service until it was all finished and the consultant said "this line shows my fees of $246". I was shocked and informed her I was told it would be around $80. Her reply was that these people who answer the phones "don't always know all the details". I explained the purpose of my first phone call was to shop around and get an idea for their fees. I feel I was misled and tricked into becoming their customer. I agree the front desk employees do not necessarily know the details but feel they should not answer general public's questions. I did think of leaving and not having them finish my taxes but was unaware of legal consequences so I decided to pay and never return to H&R Block again.
The manager of Parsons H&R Block didn’t know how to do my taxes because I am exempted from Kansas State Taxes. She went ahead and did my taxes the regular way, waving her hands around saying she didn’t know what to do, that I would just have to pay $488 in state taxes and sent me on my way. My husband looked on the internet found what he thought was the way it should have been filed. He took it up to her and she told him that it was not right so I got on the phone, calling different agencies. Two hours later, I was told by the Kansas IRS guy that my husband was right in the first place so he went back up to her. She said she would look into it. Two weeks later, she finally came up with some type of refund but she didn’t do it the way she was supposed to. So I’m just sitting here worrying about this whole mess and hoping I don’t get into trouble from this manager’s incompetence.
I normally go to H&R Block to get my taxes and I have never had a problem before now. The lady who normally files my taxes was unavailable last year so I was asked if a different person (let's call her Jamie) would be okay. I said yes- big mistake. My husband had recently passed away and I was given a check to bury him. When I turned that information in (along with the rest), Jamie wrote it on my forms. However, she didn't add it to the form that says how much money I got. Well at the time, I was guaranteed that they would take a second look, that their work was good on its word, just like every commercial says. Well when Jamie left out that check amount, it messed up my whole form and now I’m going to be forced to pay an extra $800 because of her mistake. I was offered no insurance papers to sign so they refuse to do anything about it. How is that right? How is it fair? H&R Block should be held responsible, isn't that why we pay them so much money? To do a certain job? Well it's ridiculous when said person can't do the job I paid her to do. Now that is more money out of my pocket. I am furious, I will never ever go to them for my taxes again. I would advise others to stay away also or you could be in the same situation; paying big bucks for someone else's mistakes.
IRS Audit caused by an H&R Block representative not filing properly - The non-filing of proper forms caused an internal audit which resulted in $20,000.
H&R Block messed up our 2010 tax return - Our tax return was completely done wrong, which has resulted in a 5,000$ bill from the IRS. They are admitting the return was done wrong, but are not doing anything about it, including returning fees and interest.
I was audited by the State of Arizona for my 2007 taxes. I called H&R Block office and made an appointment. I took off from work. My appointment was for 2:30pm. At 3:00pm, Mr. ** rushed up and took me back to his desk. He glance at my letter and printed up a form. Then it was good-bye. About six weeks later, I received another letter from the auditor. I owed $164. He stated I was a not for profit business and disallowed by business expenses. I'm a writer and was looking for a new publisher at that time. My question was even not for profit businesses are allowed to deduct business expenses. I made another appointment with Mr. **. I took off from work again. He was running behind again and this time, he said he needed to do research. I was completely blown off and rushed out so he could take care of a paying customer. The next day, he called back and said the Peace of Mind had expired. Basically, it sucks to be you and you need to pay the penalty. Then he wanted to set up an appointment for my 2011 taxes. Yeah, like that was going to happen. I will never do business with them again.
Compliance Fee Charges: Why is H&R Block charging huge fees for doing returns and on top of that a $4.00 compliance fee. This is not a fee that should be passed on to the customer. Is this a fee that the company or the tax preparer is benefiting from and then writing off on his/her taxes at my expense? Someone needs to look into these fees and make them properly list the prices so customers don't feel like they are being gouged by this company.
Identity theft, Illegal court action and felon still working at H&R Block - I sent **, office manager of H&R Block located at 2441 N. Maize Rd. Stes 103 & 105, Wichita, KS, my W-2 form. Not only did she not even touch my state taxes, all she did was give my personal earnings information to fellow H&R Block employee at Central and Maize, **, who maliciously used this information and tax money. ** helped her acquire illegally from the IRS and open up a fraudulent case in Wichita Kansas for Emergency Child support. She is still working there and I want her prosecuted for tax preparation crimes and I want her fired. She is still there cheating and lying on innocent victim's tax forms.
Active trader filing 1099 - H & R Block of Redding, CA is charging me $7 per trade to do my taxes. What if I was a day trader and made hundreds of trades per year? This doesn't seem reasonable.
I called the H&R Block in Rochester NH, Route 125. I asked them to tell me about the company and why I should choose them to file. This would be my first year filing and I wanted to know what my options were. I spoke to a woman and she wasn't able to give me any information and transferred me to a tax preparer. The woman (I believe her name was Lisa) was extremely rude and told me that I need to file with them before they could tell me any information. I explained how many W-2s I had and my college loans. She cut me off throughout the conversation saying “I can't tell you any information if you are not here.” She then yelled to me, “Can I finish!” After I asked why does she need my information just to tell me about the company. She was completely out of line, rude and uneducated about her job. Because of this experience, I will not be doing my taxes with H&R block. I’m going with Jackson Hewitt.
The H&R Block program, for no apparent reason, doubled the amount of tax I entered as paid for the year. As a result, the State refund indicated was inaccurate by several thousand dollars. While awaiting our State tax refund, we were contacted by the CA Franchise Tax Board and told that the refund we were expecting (and counting on) was in error and we would be receiving be about 1/4 as much as the H&R program indicated it would be. Although I reviewed the return before sending it in, the error was buried in the return and no indication in the calculations raised a red flag. I have also used H&R office services in the past. For the last couple of years, I used Turbo Tax but decided to used an H&R package this year. I will return to Turbo Tax and never use H&R Block going forward, either on-line or in office. Never ever again!
I visited H&R in Hampton Falls, NH. Bruce did a look and see. I indicated I would be getting a refund on both state and fed and asked to give me his cost. A week later, I am told I owe both state and fed, and he almost doubled his cost! Never again!
I don't understand how a company as big as HR& Block could be such thieves. I went to HR& Block last year in 2010, to file my income tax. As I sat patiently in the local office as the gentleman prepared my 2008 and 2010 Taxes. Upon completing it, he gave me loads of papers to sign. After that, he explained to me that I was unable to receive my refund until I paid my filing fees which came out to $171. I was supposed to receive a little over $2,000 in refund but I wasn't in dire need of the money so I let my paper work sit in the office until March 2012. I went back and filed my 2011 returns and they were supposed to take out a total of $214 and $34.95 for bank fees. They ended up taking $214, $34.95, and an additional $75? Where in the world did this $75 debt came from. The last time I filed with HR& Block was 2006 and I have never received any letter, phone call stating that I owed them. I spoke with the corporate offices for 3 hours total. I went to their local office, and they finally said the $75 was from 2006. I personally believe that they couldn't see where I owed them so they finally just assumed it was from the last year I filed with them. When I called the corporate office, I spoke to a customer service. She then transferred me to another gentleman who said " If I could, I would give you the $75 from my pocket," as If I was complaining or begging for small change. I'm a student, so anything helps. That $75 was earned from blood and sweat my parents immigrated from Haiti so I know the importance of money and how every dollar counts. How dare he! I was not looking for charity. I just want people to be aware of these companies. Do your own taxes, there are plenty of software that you can utilize to file your own taxes, and IRS also has offices that you can go to have them file your taxes for free (I wish I knew that before). Never again will I step foot inside any tax office!
I have been going to H&R block for almost 10 years, until this year, it will be my last. In the 2010 tax returns, my tax preparer never asked about my 1099 form from my investment firm. I was totally depending on her asking me what documents are required to file since I was paying her to do my taxes. However, no comments. Hence, IRS sent me a letter that I owe them money for 2010. I confronted her, so she filed the amendment at additional cost, very poor service.
They made a mistake on my tax refund. H&R Block filed me married and filing jointly, when I told them I was separated and filing as a head of household. They owe me $1,275.00 from 2008 taxes. It's their fault, not mine. I want my money that's owed to me. Thank you.
I paid over $58 for H&R Block online so I could file electronically as I am in Afghanistan. When done with the return, I was told that I could not file electronically because of a charitable donation. BTW, it was the same donation I had in 2010 and I filed that year electronically. I went to the online chat and received no help and was cut off 3 times trying to get help. I was scammed by H&R Block.
After having my local H&R Block office complete my federal and state taxes, I went home and reviewed the forms. They calculated I owed $2300 federal and would get $120 back from state. I realized after looking over the forms, the lady had entered my HSA distribution incorrectly. I figured out myself what she had done and why the tax they showed I owed was so high. I called and explained to them what they had done. They verified I was correct and corrected my return. Now I owe $99 federal and will get $300+ back from state. I simply said, I can buy a $60 software and do better than this myself instead of paying H&R Block $230. I wanted to trust their expertise. They offered no means of discount off their pricey fees and simply said sorry and that was it. I will never go back. I think that's a poor example of professionalism. What bugs me is that they made no effort to review the return with me to make sure there were no mistakes. I went home and did that on my own. Does this seem like the kind of service I should expect from a professional organization?
H&R Block collects ridiculously expensive fees. The fee that was quoted to me at the end of the session was almost $300! My taxes are about as uncomplicated as one can get. I was told I could decline. However, everything was completed so I hesitantly agreed to the fee (which I'm sure they count on people doing). I am definitely going to use another service next year and I have told all of my friends not to go to H&R Block. It's terrible how they take advantage of people!
I went into an H&R Block to see if I could get an appointment, they were nice and I was told I could have someone do my taxes right then and there. I asked the preparer if I could have the 1040EZ and explained that I had always used the United Way to prepare my taxes for free, since I made under a certain amount. However, this year I had 2 state returns so I couldn't use the United Way and was nervous about filing online myself. She explained she would see if I could do the 1040EZ. She began the process and then at the end, told me no, she couldn't use the 1040EZ and charged me $454.00. She then gave me a coupon for $50. I was in shock at how much I was charged but I did not know that I was allowed to say no at the end. I was not made aware that it was a "quote" and that I could have taken my things and walked out. As soon as I left and spoke with many people who had paid hundreds less at other places, I called H&R Block customer service to complain. I was told I would get a call back in 3-5 days. On day 5, I called at 8:30 pm and was told they had until midnight on day 5 to return my call. Two more days passed and I received a message on my phone on a Saturday, telling me I could call back on business hours Mondays to Fridays. I finally talked to a person ten days after my complaint. I was told that by accepting a coupon at the office, I was agreeing that I was satisfied and they could do nothing about my complaint. It was never explained to as to how my simple return that took someone 30 minutes to file could coast $454. When I used their online quote service and entered in what I had done, I was quoted $189. I feel I was completely taken advantage of as a young professional, getting my taxes done in an office for my very first time. Not once in the office, was I told that I didn't have to pay; I was rushed in and out of the office. The customer service people on the phone were rude and did not help me resolve any of the issues. I will never use H&R Block and have spread the word to everyone I know how terrible they are.
I have had my taxes prepared at H&R Block for the past three years and always paid roughly $40 for tax preparation. I am on a fixed income and receive no refund each year. This year, I filed for 2011 and was charged $237. My taxes were prepared by ** in the Burke, Virginia office. I am due a refund and have past documents as proof. Please address this matter as soon as possible. Thank you.
I filed with H&R Block, they charged me over 500 dollars and filed my taxes incorrectly. I talked to the GA Department of Revenue and they explained what was done incorrectly. Then I called H&R Block and they tried to blame it on the Department of Revenue. This is ridiculous, I can mess up my own taxes for free.
I went into H&R Block to file for 2010 income tax. I got a settlement from a sexual harassment lawsuit. My tax professional said that sexual harassment lawsuits are not taxable. I told her I needed a second opinion so we enlisted the help of a senior tax professional and the manager at H&R Block who all told me the same thing. Well, I recently got a notice from the IRS stating I did owe taxes on the money to the tune of $6,900. I got the "Guarantee Waiver" so that if H&R Block messed up, they would be held responsible. They did not honor that and have never contacted the IRS on my behalf and have left me stuck with the money. I'm pissed.
The second time, I was advised by the Franklin, NJ office to file extra income as an SCH is not a business. H&R Block is charging me $424, which was not disclosed upfront. Last year's charge was $600. Don't let them file it. Their website says, "You don't pay until you’re satisfied". I called and asked for my personal info back. To charge that much money and they are not available to reach after 4/15 is absurd. Mrs. ** has to keep referencing books and suggested that I do not file as a business this year and close business. She failed to put "final return" on business taxes last year and did not return calls. They charge CPA rates and are not CPAs.
I have gone to H&R Block for years to have my taxes done. This year was the biggest mistake I ever made. I went to the office at the Shoppes of Graylyn in Wilmington, DE. I was given the supposed tax professional ** who does not have a clue what she is doing and wanted to argue everything from the time we started to the time we were done. The biggest conflict was that my financial advisor who is not H&R Block takes his fee out of my 401(k), which is legal thing to do. She does not believe this or want to believe this even though I put her in touch with him. Is it the policy of H&R Block for their tax advisors to give financial advice, even though they don’t know what they are doing? She thinks so. I will never go to H&R Block again for anything. They are total rip offs.
After wading through hours of poor programming, the program tells me that a return has already been e-filed for my Social Security Number and that I should contact the IRS and mail in my return. I contacted the IRS. It has not been e-filed. I can't get back into the program to try again. Oddly, the interface to accept my payment works perfectly. After years of suffering through H&R Block, never again.
First impressions are everything. After walking in the door and sitting down at his desk, the H&R Block representative asked if we wanted to see a joke on his email. He shared a joke that was bashing President Obama. He thought that was funny and an appropriate thing to do. Well, that was not our point of view and told him so. This was the first "red flag" and we should have walked out then. We started into the tax forms with him and he was fully aware of all that we had to do, as he filled out a checklist up front. He did not know anything related to medical expenses or anything related to education accounts. He would "ignore" the items that he didn't know anything about. We had to continue to ask about these items. He had promised an hour or less when we made the appointment. We sat there for a very uncomfortable 2.5 hours while he looked stuff up in "his book" and was still unable to figure it out. He then told us it would be almost $600. We where shocked with that and asked why he wouldn't have told us this up front. He said he had no idea of how much it would cost until the end. Well, that was the purpose of the checklist up front. We took our stuff and walked out. Please do not get scammed by H&R Block.
I paid to have my taxes done at H&R Block in Topeka, Kansas since 2008. I got a letter in the mail last week from IRS saying that my 2010 taxes were incorrect. So, I took them into the office and had them reviewed. Come to find out the tax guy forgot to add a W-2 to our income and that caused our income to be less than what IRS showed we made. Now H&R Block won’t cover the charge, because we didn’t have the "peace of mind" coverage. They say they will only cover taxes and penalties. There has never been any additional coverage offered, and I am tired of getting screwed by H&R Block. Please Help! Show me the denied coverage! Show me anything that says I declined the coverage.
Last year I went ahead and used H & R Block to do my taxes since I had some different filing situations after a medical discharge from the military, after 13 years, which I was paid a severance payment and figured I would have a tax "professional" do them. Well, I filed and everything went fine and I received my tax refund. Then, Saturday I look at my bank account online and notice a charge from H & R Block that posted Friday and was initiated on the 23 of February of this year! The charge over drafted my account and has caused all kinds of problems. I wasn't even sure what the charge was from since I haven't even spoken with them since I done my taxes last year so. I called Bank of America to get some more information and found out that the card used for the charge was my debit card I reported lost or stolen back in November of last year. So, the card obviously wasn't closed properly. So, not knowing what the charges were from and that it was a card that was lost or stolen used I filed a fraud case with Bank of America and called H & R Block customer service and they didn't see where I owed anything so they opened a case of their own. I told them I would be calling the office I filed at and where the charge was from today when the office opened. Well, I got a call from them before I had the chance to call and the lady told me that I was to expect a charge from them for last year's taxes because they didn't get their money which I tried to look back and see if the charge had actually went through or not but it was too long ago to find out. I then told her that the card they tried using was reported lost/stolen but went through. She obviously misunderstood what I had told her because she then said we would need to set up a payment for last year's taxes since that account was closed. I explained to her again that it wasn't the account that was closed but that they used a card that was reported lost/stolen and that it's been a year and they never sent or called about the charge until this morning. She then started stuttering around and said she would have to talk to her supervisor and get back to me but I haven't heard back yet today. I also posted something about the issue on facebook and a person I know called me today and told me they did the same thing to him! They called him before me so I don't know if they tried anyone else or not. I do know something shady is going on and most likely have spent their day trying to cover their butts. I did call the bank back and let them know what I was told and they said they were still leaving the case open. I will never have my taxes done with them or anything else for that matter. We'll see how this all pans out though.
First I need to say that everyone else in the building seemed very polite but I get the one grouchy, rude and condescending older fellow. I only went to H&R Block because when I did my own taxes, I ended up owing over $4k so I thought I was doing something wrong. Well, it turns out that not only was I right but I also got the pleasure of being treated as if I was an ignorant, unprepared, boorish person who was lucky enough to sit down with this "tax expert" who kept asking questions about my return to his colleagues because he couldn't figure out why he kept getting an error on my return (he put info from w-2 into wrong block). He actually got frustrated with me because I made the colossal mistake of calling my IRA account a traditional IRA. I said this while on the phone trying to leave a message with the woman who does my investing at MetLife. While I was on the phone trying to leave this message, he would get upset and say, “No, no, it's not that." I thought his head was going to explode every time I made that mistake. When I got off the phone, I was then getting annoyed and said to him, “What's the big deal... she knows what I'm talking about, she's been doing my investing for a long time". His response was, “It's a big difference." Well, thank God I have people to invest for me. People at MetLife sure as heck didn't care if I made that mistake. So, to add insult to injury, I get the "privilege" of owing this company $300. Next year I'll trust my accounting abilities and do it myself and if I have a question, I'll take it to base where they will help for free with the added bonus of treating me with some respect. If after this review you still feel the need to go here, I highly recommend that you go in there first and meet the person who will be helping you. And if an older gentleman with the initials ** is going to be your "tax expert", run!
I received a letter in the mail which said I would get my taxes done for free for the RAC which is the one- to two- day. We all know they don't have that anymore, not the 7-14 day crap. So they charged me for a simple return of $324.50. I have used them for 6 years, and I will never use H&R block again. They are the biggest ripoff out there. I will go to Amscot or Jackson Hewitt next year, and I hope the rest of you, taxpayers, do too. Again, do not trust H&R ripoff block.
My husband and I went there this year for the first time; we filled joint. They sent it out and it came back once because something was filed wrong. Then they called themselves fixing it and sent it off again. It got sent back again and this time we were told it was still an error but we qualified for a credit. After sitting there and watching this person put the information in and apply this so-called credit, I was getting irritated. I got a call the next day saying it had been sent back again! This time because I have allegedly already filed taxes and to no surprise, we did not qualify for that credit. I obviously didn't file my taxes we were filing joint. So with all that sending and rejecting, someone has gotten a hold of my social and filed taxes. I had to go through the IRS and fill out an Identity Affidavit, send a copy of my ID SSN, etc. I am still going through the process and hoping for the best! I checked with the 3 credit companies and no cards or accounts have been opened which is how I know it was due to us going to H&R Block. We will never go there again.
Compliance fee / Hand R Block - I use their services each year, but this year, I noticed a $4.00 Compliance Fee. Is this legal? What is it for?
On February 29, I used H&R Block for the first time. I had a summer job, and my mother suggested that I go to H&R Block because she has been going to you for years and had always had a good experience and you had a free promotion. However, this was my first experience with your company, and I am very angry and disappointed. Mr. ** filled out my federal income tax form. This was no problem. But then he filled out the California State form and told me that if I wanted to get my refund, it would be $45.00 or I would not be able to get my refund. Later, I found out that Mr. ** lied to me. I was doing the simple form, and I could have had anyone help me fill it out. But Mr. ** led me to believe that the only way I could get my refund was to pay him the $45.00. I didn't know any differently, until my mother told me that he misrepresented the company with that information. I had a choice, but Mr. ** was not honest with me He showed me on his screen my federal income tax and then my state income tax refund amount. Then he asked me "If you want the state, then you have to pay the $45.00 or you can't get it." I thought I would go every year to get my taxes done, but my mom and I are going to find another place for next year, if this is the kind of people and information that is taught at H&R Block. Mr. ** flat out looked in my face, lied to me, and knew that he did. I think H&R Block owes me a refund. I plan to put the outcome in the university news. Mr. ** should have told the whole truth. I may have said yes anyway, but he took advantage of my lack of knowledge and experience. Is there anyone from H&R Block who will correct this injustice?
For the amount of time spent with your tax person, I really think that you are overcharging the customer. I've used your service for the last 12 years and each year, the cost goes up an average of $50 dollars. I always have all of my information in order to just go down a checklist. The most time spent with me is about 1.5 hours. The cost was $492.00. Your personnel are always friendly and professional, but I don't think that I will use your service again. Just too expensive. I know people that are not as organized as I am for tax preparation and they pay a lot less with other companies. I am on a fixed income and I think you should give some kind of senior discount or repeat business discount. Please consider my legitimate complaint. Sincere thanks.
Amy ** at Town & Country Shopping Center in Burnsville, MN prepared my 24-year-old son's simple income tax ($9000.00 gross income) and charged him $78.00! Here in MN, he qualified for free tax filing for both state and federal. When I called her on this, she said she was unaware of this. She should not be a tax preparer if she is unaware of MN basic filing rules. She, if ethical, would have told him he qualifies for free filing. Give him back his filing fee!
I’ve been trying to get my information out of Poughkeepsie office for the past 2 weeks and it seems no one knows how to do it. Please help me to get my money.
I sat with a tax professional for an hour, only to tell her all of my information and watched her type it into the computer. It was at the end that I found out I am being charged $458.00! They charged that much just to type things? I could've done it myself. Lesson learned, I will never go back to H&R Block. It’s ridiculous! I wouldn't be complaining if I made $458 an hour!
I filed my taxes with H&R Block on Feb. 3. I was charged $240.75.and $294.30 to pay on my Emerald card. Salvatore ** failed to file the proper tax information. I was told I would get my money within 7 days. It took 20 days and the State of California took it. In January, they gave me a $400.00 anticipation loan. The Emerald card has not shown that the $294.30 was paid. Then Salvatore had to do an amendment for my earned income credit, done on 2/13/2012. I still have no refund and I am so mad at the service from H&R Block. I have been going to them for 12 years, I want a refund from the company of $240.75. They allowed this mistake and I should not have to pay. I will not refer anyone to them ever again. I will never use their services either. I will let everyone know not to go to this company ever again. Horrible how they hire anyone with no knowledge of tax preparation experience. If anyone knows who to contact for a refund of my fees, please send me an email.
I've filed my own taxes since I was 14. I decided to go to H&R this year to save time and hassle and because I thought the fee was tax deductible. When my husband and I sat down with the preparer, my first question was to confirm that the fee was tax deductible. They said yes, just yes, no caveats and no additional explanation. Just, yes. So I proceeded with the thought that the service was basically free - whatever I'd pay in fees would reduce my tax liability. After all was said and done, I was billed $300. When I asked why it wasn't deducted, I was told that I could only deduct expenses exceeding 2% of AGI, and only if I had other itemized deductions. All of which meant no, it's not deductible in my situation. All of which would have helped me decide whether to use their service. But I felt like the work had already been done and I had no choice and I paid $300. After fuming for a day and a half and doing my own research which confirmed that I couldn't possibly have enough itemized deductions to surpass the standard deduction, meaning the info I received was even more inaccurate. I decided to contact the store manager. I believed that in light of the fact that I had received bad information, not to mention, the relative simplicity of our return, she would agree with me that the $300 fee was too high. I was hoping she could meet me half way. Instead, her response left me with the feeling that my $150 was more important than my satisfaction or the reputation of H&R Block. She claimed the employee had provided me correct info. Apparently, despite the fact that H&R provides tax advice as a service, there is no expectation that such advice will be complete or relevant to the taxpayer's situation. Moreover, I had to hold the preparer's hand through the process as he didn't seem to know what he was doing. If I'm paying someone $300 to provide a service, I shouldn't have to tell them how to do their job. H&R claims that they can get you back the largest refund, but what they don't bother to tell you is that a large portion of it will end up in their pockets.
Our tax "specialist" had no clue what she was doing. She stopped several times to get help from another lady. The other lady had to sit down at our "specialist's" computer and fix her mistake several times. Once, our "specialist" messed up all the work that the other lady had done, and then she told the other lady that she "had no idea why it was messed up; I didn't change anything," when she in fact had. It took our tax "specialist" almost 5 hours to complete our return. By the end of it, because she was so clueless, she decided that it would be better for us to take the standardized deduction instead of itemizing. Also, she refused to put me down as a full-time student, since I was being claimed as a dependent. (We lived together the whole year, but we didn't get married until 2012.) She said that since I was being claimed as a dependent, putting me down as a full-time student was pointless. Also, she had messed up somewhere and then told us our taxes were ineligible for electronic filing and that we had to send our taxes in. She then charged us $321.00 for this 5-hour fiasco in which she handed us the envelopes and told us that we needed to get to the post office and mail the letters off. The kick in the teeth for this all is that there were two times during all of this that she stopped, showed us what was on her computer (because it was telling her something was wrong), and she asked us, "What do you think I should do right here? Because I don't know, so what do you think?" She really had no clue. My wife and I are completely and utterly dissatisfied with the service we were given. And now, after many years of being loyal to H&R Block, customers are most likely never using their services again. There was also a considerable language barrier that definitely hindered the information between her and us, even her coworker who was fixing things for her had a hard time understanding her. She was a very nice lady, but her knowledge was severely lacking.
Return lost - I filed my return with H&R Block on the 6th of February. It was accepted by the IRS on the same day and H&R Block's bank is holding back my return. It will be four weeks tomorrow. They have been unhelpful when I have called them with questions. They are deceitful about where my return is, even after I spoke with the IRS (over the phone) and it was confirmed that H&R Block received it on the 29th of February. I paid an inordinate amount for the filing as well as the rapid filing fee.
I presented myself to the H&R Block to get a copy of last year's taxes. Mr. ** informed me that the lady that helped us the year prior had failed to contact us in February 2011 and have us come back in to finish the state tax, so the state tax was not filed until today! I paid $250 in Jan 2011 to H&R Block to complete my taxes for 2010. The state was filed a year late due to their sloppy work. So far, I know of no consequences except the fact that they put me in harm's way not completing the transaction I paid them for in good faith. I do feel they at least owed me a partial refund.
H&R Block - Incompetent Tax Preparers: On February 15, 2012, I went to H&R Block for the first time. When I called for the appointment, I also got a price quote on how much it would cost ($200) so there would be no surprises at the end of my visit. The lady who did my taxes was very nice. However, when she finished, she told me that I was getting back $4,726.00 in state income taxes. This didn't seem right to me as I have never gotten such a large return from the state before. I asked her to review the information a second time to ensure it was correct. She did and she smiled and told me, “Yep, it’s correct!” Well, I had to take a form home for my husband to sign, authorizing them to do our taxes. So, the next day when I returned to H&R Block to drop off the form, I again told our tax preparer that something didn't seem right. She checked it for a third time and told me it was correct. It still didn't sit well with me. Luckily, my taxes hadn't been processed yet so I decided to purchase the Peace of Mind Guarantee from H&R Block just in case she had made a mistake. A few weeks later, we got our refund from the state. However, I didn't feel comfortable spending it until I knew 100% that our taxes were right. I then went on H&R Block's website and did my taxes myself. It was then that I figured out her mistake. She had flipped my reserve military pay, which is tax exempt with my full time civilian pay, which is not. I calculated that we owed all but $900 of the $4,726 back to the state. So I went to a different H&R Block branch to have our taxes amended. The lady that helped me had never done a state amendment and needed help from the branch manager who was busy at the time with another client so I had to leave my paperwork with her. She called a few hours later and said not only did we owe all of the $4,726 back, but we owed an additional $88. I told her that didn't seem right and asked her to check it again. She did and called me back an hour later to tell me that she had made a mistake and that I was indeed correct and that we only owed $3,930 back to the state. It was at this point that I completely lost my faith in H&R Block's ability to perform a simple tax return. I have no idea how to file a tax return and I was able to figure out my taxes better than the two so-called "H&R Block tax experts". So now I have decided to file a claim to H&R Block under the Peace of Mind Guarantee I purchased. The guarantee states, "If you owe additional taxes as a result of an error in tax preparation and the error is discovered by you, your representative or a tax authority, during the period of three years from the filing deadlines for such returns not including extensions, Block will pay you for such taxes up to a cumulative total of $5,500 for all such returns, subject to the terms and conditions detailed below." I don't have much faith that they will honor this, and I'm sure they find some loop hole to get out of it, but I'm up for a fight so bring it on H&R Block. Oh, and next year, I will be doing my own taxes now that I know how easy it is. I don't why you would pay someone else to do them!
H&R Block was granted permission to visit my the break room at my place of work (you're welcome for allowing you access to over 300 potential clients), at which time the representatives distributed flyers for tax service specials, and explained the details of their available services. At no time did any representative indicate that there was a separate $40 charge for the state filing. After asking about my specific situation, I was told that I would fall into the 1040EZ category, which would qualify for a free service on or before February 29, 2012. I came to H&R Block on February 28th for service, and after waiting for over 30 minutes past my appointment time to be seen, my service was rendered. However, it was not until the end of the paperwork that I found myself in a horribly embarrassing and frustrating situation. I was told that I owed $140.00. I asked why, and I was informed for the first time that the state filing would be a separate charge, and that the savings bond that I had cashed and the Roth IRA that I had taken my contributions out of had cost me $100 to file. What? Why would their representatives not have informed me while they were selling me on something else at my work, and why would their representative not have informed me at the beginning of the sit-down in-person meeting when I specifically mentioned everything I had going on, and then presented the coupon for the free service. If it was not going to be free, then that would have been okay if the representative had just simply let me know as soon as she heard what I had to present for paperwork and details. I felt very, very uncomfortable as I felt compelled to contribute to her commission (and because I know that I will see her around town at other onsite for work), and misled and lied to at the same time. The 'time saved' feature on the screen was also a lie in my case, because I waited very patiently for quite a while just to be seen after making an appointment. Since nothing was free, they did not save me time, money or peace of mind. I will never recommend H&R to anyone again, nor will I return. If H&R Block ever re-visits the break room at my place of work (which will certainly not be set up by me again), I will be sure to inform the employees of the misleading sales practices that I encountered. Surely, I will not wait until next year. My word will be informing people properly as of immediately. This will be to protect others from throwing away money when they are not prepared to, and to protect my fellow co-workers from when they are not told that they will owe until they are in the very uncomfortable situation that I was in. I have been in sales for almost 15 years. This was a very intentional misleading business practice. Thank you much for teaching me a very expensive lesson, and for making me wait between 30 and 40 minutes beyond my appointment time to pay for that embarrassing, disappointing moment. I will make it a point to market the horrible business practices, as marketing is what I do for a living. It is the business practice of straightforward and honest marketing that has allowed for me to pay them for my experience.
He lied to me about not having info from last year’s tax info. I saw it as he was doing my taxes. He said I would have to pay him to file taxes even though I was only getting $184 back. I got $420.00 back last year. He would not let me add my common law husband to my taxes. Rude.
Recently, I posted an incident at H&R Block and their Irvington, NJ was able to handle it and get my refund for this miscommunication. Natale, she was great and I thank her.
This is about H&R Block Sears, Watchung, NJ, regarding the office manager Belinda, and the HR representative Ray. On 3/1/2012, I sent my teenager to file his taxes at H&R Block, because their advertisement said they offered free tax preparations for those using a 1040EZ form. Their office at Sears ended up taking almost half of my son’s refund, through extra charge, charging him for around $80.00 in fees. They also made a mistake when recording his personal information in the documents. When I called and questioned the office manager and the tax preparer, we were basically told it was our fault. They said it was my son’s fault, because he chose to have his state prepared by them, and he chose the refund to go onto an H&R Block card, which ended up costing him additional fees and charges. So, of course my son doesn't want to ever use H&R Block again. He feels they took advantage of him, and has no plans of using them in the future. If they had admitted to making an error, and offered to reimburse my son, if not all the fees, maybe a portion of the fees we may have a different opinion. I wanted to share this, so that others are aware of this office’s way of doing business. Don't trust them with your taxes. I personally would not refer anyone to use them, because they take advantage of those not knowing what to do. I trusted them to take care of my son's taxes. They took almost half of his refund. They refused to reimburse us for the extra fees, even though they made mistakes on his taxes.
I, as usual, have used H&R Block to eFile my tax return. In addition, I have used the same tax preparer for 5 years. Every other year, my ex-husband and I alternate the claiming of our son. This year, my tax preparer made an error and claimed my son during the eFile process. Now, what does this do for me? Well my ex-husband cannot file his taxes until after I have received my refund, at which point, I need to pay to mail the amended tax return with the amount that was mistakenly given to me, and then wait another 10 business days so the IRS can amend the tax return, which will be in the month of April. I have never received the $50.00 refund, today is 3/1/2012, I was to receive my return on or about 2/21/2012. That never happened either. My tax preparer still charged me for a Rapid Refund even though according to the IRS, it will not happen until 3/12/2012. The IRS told me that all tax preparers are well aware of the delay. I contacted the H&R Block Corporate office and filed a case complaint. I was given a case number and was told that that I would receive a call from the complaint department in 3-5 days. Today is 3/1/2012, day 4 of the 3-5 day wait I was told to allow for the H&R Block complaint department to look into the complaint. I called H&R Block again today, just to check on the status of the investigation by the complaint department. I was told by the supervisor of the complaint department, "no one has looked into my case yet". I told her today is day 4, so I should hear from someone by tomorrow? She told me that she cannot guarantee that I would hear from them by day 5. Okay, so if anyone is listening here, do not use H&R Block. Something has happened to this organization and they will not be there when they drop the ball! God forbid I am ever audited and need that "guaranteed attorney to accompany you". Chances are, I will be left in the lurch at the courthouse. Clearly, my loyalty for the past 5 years is meaningless. Their word, "to call you back if there is a problem". That is meaningless as well. Next year, I will be filing my own taxes, keeping the $367.00 in my pocket. In the meantime, I will be sending a complaint to the BBB in Missouri (Corporate Office) and at least I know that sooner or later, I will get the answers I deserve.
H&R Block charged me $136.00 for a simple tax return of $300.00. I couldn't even understand the woman, she spoke bad English. Also, I had my 1 month old baby there so the woman did my taxes and walked to the front counter said have a good day and left for the day quickly. The lady at the front desk said it will be $136.00. I told her how is it that much when I am only getting $300.00 back and I told her the lady who did my taxes did not do anything major. The lady said well she is a professional and said it will be $136.00. I had no choice than to pay. I feel very upset that I was charged this much and they would do that to me and see I have a newborn child and know obviously I need money.
2008 tax cut did not calculate the pension exclusion correctly. They excluded the entire amount and I have to pay tax and penalties because of it. H&R Block is playing telephone tag instead of addressing my concern.
I have been a client with H&R block for six plus years and I had received a paper in the mail for free tax service this year and, of course, they charged me $324.00 for a simple return. I will never go to them again and it is not the first time they have ripped me off. They should be sued for the money that they are stealing from all their clients. I hope that the millions of people who reading these complaints would not use this scamming company. They really are liars and it is all false advertisement when it comes to them. So all who choose them should be prepared to be ripped off and all that have used them know what I am going through.
I used H&R Block in East Patchogue New York, to file my tax return, I paid $350. When I received my check, I went to the bank to deposit and the check bounced! I waited 2 hours in the office for a new check to print and that one bounced, too! While I waited, the woman at the front desk was loudly talking about her personal life, bra size, religion, how she hated her job and hours! All while checking her Facebook and flaunting photos! The manager was nowhere to be found! I made a formal complaint with H&R Block Headquarters and I am still waiting for a response! I also still have not received my check. I was told to come in today at 9am, only to find out they open at11am. I am very dissatisfied! I would not recommend H&R Block to anyone! I paid extra to use a franchise company and received horrible results!
We understand you can not control what is going on with the IRS, but what you can control is good customer service! H&R did not tell us what was going on till after we filed our taxes; in other words, after we singed the paperwork that agreed to pay them $315.00 for the RAC. H&R new what was going on and continued to take money for a service they could not provide. As we sat there doing our taxes, not once did the tax preparer say you might not get this in 7 to 14 days due to delays; she said it will be available 7 to 14 days and you might add on a day or two due to your bank. We found out what was going on when we were walking out and over heard an upset customer. Then we started asking questions and they said that was only for the people who field last week. Then when ours did not come in on time, we called H&R and were point blank lied to! I asked why did you not tell us on the 3rd of February what was going on and she told me they did not know. Then I said, “**. You just lied to me because we over heard what was going on.” I then asked why did H&R charged us $315.00 for RAC when they knew they could not get our funds to us any earlier. She stated, “Oh, you don't pay that much to get your money earlier; you pay that much for us to take our fees out of your taxes not up front!” I had to laugh. So your telling me if I paid up front, it would have been cheaper and I would still have to wait this long--then I would have done it that way! The point is we paid for a RAC--that means to get it faster and yes to withhold fees from my refund. But the main thing is to get it faster--at least two weeks faster. And H&R knew that was not going to happen and yet still continued to say 7 to 14 days and charge $315.00! Let’s be honest and take some responsibility, H&R. If we were told upfront what was going on, we would have just filed the cheaper way and waited for the time we are waiting now! H&R should be held responsible for their actions and have to pay back the money they got from services they did not provide! Again, H&R, we understand you can't control what is going on with the IRS but you sure did not mind taking advantage of the delay. H&R still got their millions in fees and we customers are still waiting for our own money!
The H&R Block agent entered all of my tax information, had me sign, to only then tell me that "the computer", for some reason, would not file my taxes under the 104OEZ, and that I might want to file on my own, as it would cost $90 for H&R Block to file. I own my home. I am married. I have an income under $50,000, including my wife's social security payment. That's it, but the H&R Block agent was clueless, as to why the computer wouldn't file my return under 1040EZ, really. The H&R Block agents do not know in advance, on a simple return like mine whether it will or will not file under 1040EZ? So, I left the store without a copy of the return they prepared, because she said they would have to charge me to give me a copy. So, I will file online on my own. What a glorious waste of time!
I contacted Nutley, NJ H&R office and spoke to a rep. I was told I qualified for free filing of EZ 1040. When I got there and taxes were finished, they told me the price was $132.00 vs $39. I questioned why I was quoted another price and free filing. I was told due to the fact that I had an IRA Traditional vs a Roth, it did not qualify me. The preparer told me she "assumed it was a Roth" and she said "I have to make sure to find out next time before I quote a price". When she told me the lowest she could go is $100 and she could mail me back the $32 after tax season, I left in shock and reported it to the district office in Irvington, NJ and a gal named Natalie said she would take care of it. I am requesting that H&R honor their original quote of $39 and refund me $93.00 vs $32 immediately as an act of good faith. I will wait to see if Natalie from the Irvington office who is handling this in lieu of Nyree **, the manager of the district office, and then if not satisfied, I will report to the BBB. I am very upset over this and H&R is guilty of what sounds like a "bait and switch", which is not a professional way of handling taxes and others' money.
I had my taxes done via H&R Block yearly in the DC area, and it seems like they go up by an enormous amount yearly. My bill was $280, and I didn't have as many deductions! My mom is retired, so her bill was okay at $55 (I think. She is 81 years old, by the way), but my brother, who has little to no deductions, with the exception of tithes/offerings to the church, was billed over $300! It's outrageous! I am not sure how they even stay in business! It's a ripoff, for sure! I am now in the process of looking for a CPA to do our taxes for next year.
My fiancée talked me into going to H&R Block because of all the good things you guys can do. When I made the appointment I was told they would schedule it so we had time for the both of us to do our taxes. However, I’m a first impressions kind of gal. When the guy acted like hey I’ve been here all day and you’re going to have to wait and then not happy we both had separate taxes, I was feeling like wanting to go. After my fiancée was done, we started with mine and he was like you can’t do this and that and you owe that’s just how it comes out. So I signed the paperwork, really upset, and went home. After looking over the taxes, he never put my daughter on as my dependent. His excuse when I called was weird: the program didn’t transfer this over. Yes, he amended my taxes at no charge but I’m still waiting for my refund, which could have been a couple of weeks and will now take 10-12 weeks longer. Plus, on top of all that, my fiancée just got a letter from the State of Michigan stating that was processed wrong as well. All I know is that this experience has really put a bad taste in my mouth and we won’t be back. Especially when the man who did our taxes was a tax preparer 3 to which I assumed was supposed to be smart. Boy, was I wrong.
I spent 1.25 hours with an agent who I did not feel comfortable with. She did not seem to know what she was doing and actually told me how confusing it is even for her. I was charged $366.50 after using a coupon. I had 2 W2's, cashed in a 401K and had two state forms. I have used H&R Block before when I've had more to file and have never paid this much. What upset me more is that she couldn't explain what the charges were for. I was so flustered that I paid and left planning on calling customer service the following business day. I have called customer service numerous times and have yet to receive a resolution. A woman in the escalation center told me I would not receive a refund and said I was 'entitled' to never use them again. I asked if anyone even looked at my paperwork to make sure it was correct and if she could just provide an explanation of charges. She admitted she did neither. I have called a few times since and she still can't seem to 'find' and breakdown of the charges. I'll be contacting the BBB and will send the corporate office my complaint as well. I will never use H&R Block again and neither will my friends or family.
We have been using H&R Block for the last 9 years and a few times early on before that. We have used the same tax person for those last 9 years and really like her very much. We sat down at the desk and proceeded to file. We use a tax person as we have a few extras such as stock and dividends that we feel better talking with our tax person. However, we never minded paying to have our taxes done and found it to be reasonable, but with no explanation of the price going up as much as it did we were in utter shock. For approximately 45 minutes of the hour that we get, the other 15 min. were idle chit chat, our cost was $449. As much as we like our tax person, we will never go back to H&R block. We will never again recommend H&R Block. I remember going to one of their offices back in the early 90's when we were first married and I think we paid somewhere in the neighborhood of $30 to have our taxes done. I understand that prices go up, but this was ridiculous. So I say -- No thank you, H&R Block. We are done.
My wife and I filed our taxes with H&R Block. It cost around $400. Three weeks went by and no return. So we called them, they said IRS had rejected it. So why hadn't they told us. H&R Block said we needed to paper file, they would charge us $200 for the papers. So my wife called the IRS. She has a stolen identity PIN. She found out that H&R Block had entered the PIN in the wrong place. We contacted them for this easy fix. It took two days for them to say they have problems with their software, and they cannot fix it. Funny thing is when we filed, the girl said she had others with a PIN and they have had to paper file with H&R Block. So this must have been known about the PIN not working. How many other families have filed and been told IRS have rejected their claim. When it's H&R Block at fault.
I went to H&R Block, and they did my taxes. I was very satisfied with the person that did them, but when it came time to pay, I owed $307.00. I am a single mother with a child, and they charged me up to $32.00 for each form they filled out. Watch out people, they are robbers. I did get a print out of each charge, so I know what they did, just highway robbery! They claimed they could not offer any credits. My return is one of the simplest ones to do. From now on, I will be doing them myself!
My son who is 22 and in college (every penny counts) started the process of "Free Filing" total fees was $60.90! His taxes were not complicated, he had no itemized deductions. And after you spend a hour entering all the information they require, you get nailed with a Refund Deposit Account Fee of $32.95 and a free edition state return (M0) fee of $27.95! His total "Free" preparation fee of $60.90 was 12% Free Fee of his total return.
I have filed my taxes with H&R Block for many years just as many of the testimonies on this site. This year I filed at an office on February 3rd and paid the fees to have my check within 2 weeks and that I would receive a call. After I did not receive a call I visited the office and I was told the IRS was delayed by 4-7 days. Once again I did not receive a call after another week of waiting. I visited the office once again and the representative said "Have you checked the website IRS.gov?" I explained that I was told I would receive a call. Now IRS.gov states it will be March 6th. Next year I will seek another service or a private accountant.
I filed my taxes the 3rd of February with the understanding that the return would be here in no later than 14 business days. Now being the 24th, I am pissed. H&R Block knew about the IRS delays at the time I filed and yet I was not informed nor have they tried to contact me. I have filed with them for almost 20 years. I am glad to say that I will never open their door again. They should give the money that they charged people this year back to them because we could have mailed them off ourselves and got them back by the time they will have them to us. I spent $391.00 to e-file.
I took my taxes in the H&R Block office to be processed and I left them there. I got a phone call from a person that had a question and I didn't hear any more. I waited and waited for about two weeks. I went to the office to see if they were done and they were. They charged an outrageous $157. I am a single woman with no deductions and to be charged this amount is unheard of. Can something be done?
First of all, I usually do my own taxes, so I am not dumb. Due to time constraints, I decided to have it done. The lady I had, did not know how to proceed with my stock information, so I had to leave it, and take my time to come back the next day. I found out that my charges reflected the additional time for another rep to review the forms. That's not my problem! If the lady would have been trained correctly, that would not have happened. After fussing, I paid for it. Then shortly after I was home, I got a call, and said I had to come back, because they forgot to get my federal W-2! Again, I have to take my time and gas to cover their butts, because of their oversight. Will I go back? Never! I should have had a partial refund. The reason I went, was for time constraints, but I had to spend extra time and gas (twice) to get my taxes filed? I am going to tell everyone I know, do not use H&R Block! By the way, I occasionally write newspaper columns. Guess what one of my topics will be?
H&R Block was not truthful about the money being put on the Emerald Coast Card on or around Feb 15, 2012. My brother, who filed on the Feb 13, 2012, got his money Feb 22,2012 . The agent I talked to said, it would take longer for direct deposit. She lied, I could have been had my money back. Now, when I call, they tell me 3 weeks after the date of acceptance. I have used H&R Block for years and they sat in my face and lied to me about that card. It will take a month for my money to be put on that card. I could have saved $355.00 that I spent to have it there faster. Shame on you H&R Block.
I took my paper work to the office to get my taxes prepared. I am a divorced woman with no deductions. After about two weeks when I didn't hear whether they were prepared or not, I stopped in the office only to find out I was charged $157. I have never paid such an outrageous amount. Is there something that can be done? I purchased my home through a government program in 2010 and I am having a hard enough time making ends meet.
My 18 year old son went into H&R Block here in Hemet, CA to file a 1040EZ under their ad of free tax preparations. Expecting her to guide him, he told her he lives at home with his parents (and we support him) and showed that he only had $4,100.00 income for the year. She filed him as "not being able to be claimed on someone else's taxes return". We called to her to see what can be done about this, she said she needs to file an amendment and it will cost him $100.00 to do this (which is what the tax board charges). That was a lie (we found out). The tax board doesn't charge for this service, she does! My husband called her "superiors". They told him to have our son call her back. He did for 2 days. She was always too busy to take his calls. My son and husband went into the office. She admitted that it was her fault, but it will cost to fix it. That's just not right! I don't do taxes but I know enough to know that an 18 year can't survive a year on $4,100.00 and when they say they live with their parents, obviously, they are being supported by someone. So is this how they get their money for doing "free taxes"?
My husband took our letter to H&R Block that stated they would do our taxes for free, which I thought was fantastic. He came out of the office with H&R Block charging us a $158.95 fee and we will only receive a $535.00 refund. This was to do a simple return for a couple living on one making just above minimum wage & one on social security. This is the worst deceptive practice that I have seen in a very long time.
I have been using free file since 2009. This year, I filed my federal return with no problem. When I went to log in a few days later, to process my state return, all my information was gone. It was telling me to process everything again. I called on three different occasions, before being told there was nothing they could do, since I was using the free edition. I cannot have access to my previous returns, or the current one. However, they are able to see them on their end. I was told I will have to reprocess my 2011 return, and mail in the state form, because I wasn't going to be able to efile. I was also advised if I wanted copies of the previous year's federal returns, I would have to contact the IRS. It seems like there could have been a way for them to reset the program, so I could have access to it.
I went to pick my returns up and have them did by my employer. Picked up papers and mailed to individual only to find out that H&R Block did submit my returns without my knowledge and signing any paper work. I called manager Greg for explanation on what had happened.
I made an appointment with an H & R Block office (Baton Rouge, Louisiana- Highland Road) right down the street from our house. When my husband and I arrived, we were not greeted by anyone at the front desk, and finally, someone came to ask us what we needed. I stated I had made an appointment for 1:00. The gentleman told me that the person who we were scheduled to meet with, was with someone else. I came to find out that they take walk-ins, which is fine, however, it would have been nice to know this before, since I made an appointment, and was planning on not having to wait. He told us that there was someone else (Edward **) who could help us, and that we could have a seat at his desk, and that he would be right with us. We waited for about 20 minutes for this man to come out of the back (the whole time we could hear him chatting with another employee). When he finally came out, he was far from professional. We told him that we had just gotten married last year in 2011 (so our returns for 2010 were filed separately). He continued on to enter the information into the computer. He kept putting in the social security numbers, our phone numbers, address, etc., wrong and kept having to go back and re-enter the information. What could have taken 30 minutes, took over 2 hours. My husband and I do not own a house, we have no assets and did not need to itemize, so it should have been fairly quick and simple process. (I should have just done them myself, I know). After 2 agonizing hours, he told us that we would owe almost $300.00. Are you kidding me? $300 for what? For him to fill in the blanks? Of course, I could not say "don't worry about it" at that point, since we had already sat there for so long watching him go back time and time again from putting in incorrect information. We set up a direct deposit account, and to have the fees deducted from our return. He then told us that we could have him look at our returns from last year for a fee of $30.00 a piece, despite what the lady on the phone told me when I made the appointment, "make sure you bring in your return from last year, we offer a free review service". Then he stated that it wouldn't matter if he looked at the returns from last year or not, because we weren't married then, so it was pretty much a waste of time. A few days later, we got a phone call saying that our return was rejected by the IRS. We were told that my social security number and my name did not match. I had not yet changed my name on my social security card, and though I should have told him this, he is the "expert" and "professional", and he should have been the one to ask this question, since we did tell him that we just got married the year before. That was finally fixed, and our return was accepted. We have not gotten our return yet, but H & R Block has taken money directly out of our account, which they were not supposed to do. They were supposed to take the money out of our return. I am so angry, and I think this is absolutely unacceptable.
I have to start by saying we were very satisfied with our tax preparer. She was very professional and polite. We have been going to H&R Block to get our taxes done for years now and we keep coming back because we like the service we receive. By saying that, I am completely disgusted with the increase in charges from H&R Block to get our taxes done. Over the last 3 years, the charge has doubled and for no good reason. I understand the economy issues and everything is getting more expensive, but I paid $175.00 to get our taxes done 3 years ago. Last year, we were then charged $270.00 ($100.00 increase!), then yesterday, we were charged $350.00 (another $80.00 increase!). She tried to explain to us they charge by form and no matter what you buy, there is always going to be an increase every year. Which I then explained to her, that we have had the same forms with the addition of one when we had our child and I did not realize they charged $180.00 for one form and that I would expect an increase but was thinking more along the lines of $10 to $20 a year. Needless to say, we will not be going back there again to get our taxes done. I was satisfied with the service but not satisfied with continually getting ripped off.
My husband and I were expecting a rapid refund to pay our bills and some debt. We did our taxes on the 3th of Feb. and were told that we would get our money on or two days around the 15th. On the 17th we called to find out why we haven't received them and were told it was a hold up from the IRS. I'm steamed! We have this in writing so I was wondering if there are any law suits against H & R Block that we could possibly be a part of. This is totally fraud on H & R blocks part. My thoughts are that H & R Block should wave the fee or at least give us a large discount on doing our taxes. They should not be allowed to tell us we are getting our money at a specific date when we don't receive it I would say that is fraud? I have read many of these complaints and fall into the same category as the rest of the folks who have complained on this web site. To top it all off our Emerald card has been charged now for even checking to see if the money is there yet. Of course we called the IRS and they told us that we will probably see the money by the 27th. That's a far cry from the 15th.
I already filled a complaint, just making a statement .I find it funny that everyone that has filled with H&R Block has had nothing but issues, rude service, and when you ask them a question about your return that you paid for, they have no INFO and are blaming the IRS. When everyone that has used Turbo tax and other online sources have had no Issues what so ever and have already received the refund, while everyone that filled with H&R Block are stuck fiddling our thumbs hoping we receive our return within the next month or so. I have used them for over 6 years now and I have never felt so screwed in my life. I will be filling my taxes with Turbo tax next year and will only have to pay $80.00 to fill not $360.00.
I decided to take my fiancé Yesenia ** to get her taxes done right. So we went to the location 5601 Bandera Rd, Ste 104, San Antonio, TX (210) 521-4035. She sat down with a young gentleman, slim, dirty blonde hair named David. He seemed to be well mannered. About 20 minutes into the preparation, I got up from the waiting room to go see how far along they were and also grab my son from my fiancé, because he was getting to be a handful. I asked David what was the total charge for all this. He exclaimed that it would be over 200 dollars. I said, “Well, then we are just going to think about it,” because I felt that it was just a little too much. I could have gotten the same results for free with TurboTax. I grabbed my son and walked away. I heard him whisper something to my fiancé as I was walking away. It annoyed me, but I waited until they were done talking. We headed to our vehicle and it was then that I asked her what the gentleman whispered to her. She said that David had told her that this was her money and taxes and that she could do whatever she wanted with it, not me. I quickly went back and confronted David about his disrespectful remarks. I told him that he was out of line. I did tell him a few choice words. It really upset me that he thinks it’s any of his business when and where we are going to spend our money. Is this how H&R Block does business?! He said to me, "You are absolutely right sir, and I apologize" as he stood there in his arrogant ways. I wasn’t accepting anything he had to say. I think that this character should have had the sense of being professional, non-bias, respectful, and kept his personal opinions to himself regardless of what he felt. I also told him that this is probably the reason why their place is so empty. He has no customer service skills. How did he get past training?! Was there even a training process?!
First when I went in to have my taxes done, I was to receive a great deal of return, but when I was charged $412 or something like that, I said “OK since I am receiving well, but now that I am only getting back half that amount and less papers to fill out, I don't think so!” Same amount to pay. They can kiss my business out! Their prices have never been so ridiculous like now! Get real, H&R, get real! We, the people, need "all" of our hard-earned money back! I will stick to my family member that does it better and looks out for us as before. He warned me, but I wouldn't listen. Now I see.
This is a bait-and-switch complaint. The software works okay, though some SW glitch cost me almost 2 hours on the phone. When you e-file a state return, it costs you an additional $20! Instead, you should print it 2 pages and mail it. No company should charge for e-filing, and certainly, not charge such an outrageous amount for returns that aren't complicated!
I went to H&R Block to do my taxes last February 2, 2012 here at El Paso, Texas. I was told I was requiring additional information. I had to schedule a second appointment and nothing was resolved. I called the IRS office and got the information requested, scheduled a 3rd appointment and they submitted the documentation to the IRS, they told me that I will receive my refund after 2-3 weeks. One day after that, I received a call from the H&R Block representative saying that the case was rejected. That day, I paid around $194.00 for the service. I had to call again the IRS to verify the information and re-scheduled an appointment today, February 20, 2012. I had an appointment at 4:00 pm and the representative had other appointment at the same time. She attended the other person and after 45 minutes, I was not attended and I had to leave the office very angry. So I am frustrated, I am really disappointed and don't know what else to do. I asked the person in the front desk to change my representative and asked them to return my money back and to do my taxes in a different place, but they told me that is not possible. Any help is welcomed! I recommend you to think before you go and do your taxes with this company. Per my experience, I think some of the representatives are not well trained, they do not respect your appointments, the equipment or devices for electronic signature is continuously failing,etc. I suggest you to better analyze other options.
I had a situation at my local H&R Block office in Boonville, Indiana where the "tax specialist" (who was a barking nimrod) omitted a lot of my information, told me my husband and I owed the state $900, then had the gall to say the cost for their "services" would be almost $300. I collected my W2's and proceeded to leave. She said I could try to do them myself, but that it was doubtful I'd have any different results. Then she said she'd be more than happy to keep the info in the system for me for when I returned. I told her not to bother and left. There had been quite a few commercials for their deals and guarantees to get you the most back, etc. This is definite misrepresentation of services and they are pulling a bait and switch to get people in the door. Had I not had the presence of mind to realize something was terribly wrong, I would have just put my head down and paid it and accepted it that "well, they are the experts". I went home and did them through TurboTax and while my husband and I did indeed owe the state, it was only $211 and not $900. It was all e-filed and we were only charged $66. H&R Block should spend less on their misleading commercials and more on training their so-called "specialists". I hope people realize that you don't have to file through them just because you visited their office. You can leave at any time and you are not obligated to file through them.
On January 21st, my husband and I filed our taxes. The IRS took most of the return for an overpayment, leaving a balance $359.92 towards our return. After we were informed of this after several calls, I was told by Susan that the money had been put on our Emerald card. I informed her that no money had been placed on the card and she said she was going to make a call and see what she could find out. This was on Feb. 7th 2012. She never called me back, so I called the office the following day. I spoke with another woman at the office, explained the situation and I was told that Susan was at the Skowhegan office that day, but she would call her and see what she found out. Again, I did not get a call back. I again called. The same woman answered and told me Susan had not found out anything and that’s why she hadn’t called me back, something to do with a down website was the excuse. She then said that the reason the money was not put on the card was because we owed H&R Block more than our returns. I was fine with the fact that it went to our balance owed, but informed her I needed to know where the money had went because I needed to know what the balance would be on our Emerald card, as it needed to be paid by Feb. 15th. No one ever got back to me. After several days, I called the # on the Emerald card and was able to find out my balance on the card. It went from $677.00 to $522.00, showing that $145.00 went towards the Emerald card and $216.00 went to the filing fees for the taxes. On Feb. 15, my husband went in to the office to pay the balance of $522.00 on our Emerald card. He was then told he could not make that payment there, but he had to pay them $216.00 for their fees. He was there at 4:30 in the afternoon. He came home and told me what happened and I called them immediately informing them they had already been paid. That’s where our return money went. She then said her computer didn’t show they had been paid as of Friday the 10th. I said, “So you never even looked to see if it had been updated since the 10th?” Today is the 15th, by now, I was angry and she said maybe the money went to interest. She said she was going to make a call and see what she could find out. I asked her if she was going to call me back that night as I had to get that money back to make the payment or I was going to be charged interest and late fees. She said she would. I hung up and then called back right away to inform them we were coming down to get this straight. The woman that answered said Susan was on the phone trying to take care of this. I told her we were coming and would be there within 10 minutes. We live 5 miles away. She said they would be closed in 10 minutes and I said, “You just told me Susan was on the phone trying to take care of this matter, just tell her we are on our way.” I hung up and my husband and I got there to locked doors, but all the lights were on. My husband knocked and no one came. He then said they were in there because he could see them. So I knocked again louder still they ignored us. We left and we were angry at how unprofessional the behavior was. I called the Emerald card # and in 1 phone call, I found out that they had been paid on Feb 8th (the Newport, ME office) in the amount of $216.00 and they should not have taken the $216.00 the day before. (Susan had not been able to get this information in over a week’s time?) The person gave me his name, Damon, the date it was paid, the amount to give to Susan and a number to reach him at. The next day, Feb. 16th, I got a ride from a friend. I went to the office with the info and was told to leave, I was trespassing. I had no idea what he was talking about. I just wanted our money back. He then informed I was to have been served a no trespassing notice the night before. I wasn’t! I walked out and called the police trying to get my money back where I was then served with the no trespassing notice for banging on the door the night before! So they basically admitted they were there and refused to settle the situation with a client who paid for the services and was then charged again, only to get a no trespassing notice, while they continue to keep the money that does not belong to them. As I heard for weeks, she is going to look into it! So today is Feb. 20th. I still have not received my money or an apology. After days of phone calls and complaints filed, I am told someone will get back to me!
First of all, I've been with H&R Block for 25 years. I've been participating in the advance every November, since they offered it. This past November 2011, I applied and received $600.00, so when I did my taxes on February 2, 2012 I would pay it back with my refund, that H&R Block said I would receive on 2/15/2012. Now, I'm charged for a late fee, for not receiving my taxes on time, aside from their charge for $232.00 and late fee, plus the monthly payment of $30.00. My tax is supposed to be free, if you come in before 2/4/2012. I came in 2/2/2012. Not only that, I bought my best friend with me for the first time, and I should have gotten an incentive for that, but I didn't. My friend left her tax preparer for 15 years. I'm embarrassed. I deserve all my money back. I will never return, and I will pass it on to other clients.
I called to see how much they would charge me and I was told free for federal and $30 for state. I went in on February 2, 2012 and first, the woman said, "Oh, you don't have to file because you made under $10,000." I said well they did take taxes out so she did them and at the end, I was charged $70. Then she stated 7 to 10 days. So at the 10th day, there was nothing on my card. I checked the paperwork and it stated the 15th. So I called and they said it's 7 to 10 business days. Okay, it's now February 18th and I still have nothing on my card and I am getting the runaround from them. They said the IRS is having trouble with their website so I should try back in a few days.
I went in to file a simple tax return, and ended up spending 2 hours and $178, only to be told that I owe $450. What the **!
This is my problem. I filled my taxes on February 3rd 2012. The IRS had excepted my return I would have my money on my emerald card in seven to 14 days. No problem. It is now the 18th of February and still no money. I went on the IRS website which said I would be receiving my refund on the 6th of March. What is this about, considering my co-worker filled hers on the 5th of February, at the same location and received her refund on the 12th. Her return was way more than mine (by the way) and I have to wait over a month to get my money and on top of it was charged $360 to file for what they call a fast return. I have been with H&R Block for over six years and this will be my last! I want to know why it is taking so long.
I went to H&R Block on February 1st, 2010, to get my taxes filed. Mine is very simple. I am a single mother with no assets. It literally took the agent 20 minutes to complete my returns. The only reason I agreed to a $300 fee was because I was under the impression that I would get my returns loaded onto to my Emerald card in as little as 72 hours-14 days. Day 15 rolled around, and I started to get concerned. I checked online, and the 1-800 number for the IRS, which told me my returns were processed and would be sent to me by the 14th of Feb. I called H&R Block a few times, and got different excuses from each employee, so I went to the office in person last night, to get answers. Karen **, office manager, had some great excuses and stories about how the IRS data-bank overloaded, and no one is receiving their federal taxes on time. She also told me that H&R Block has nothing to do with the delay. I have now spoken with several people, who filed their taxes after me for under $100, and received payments. I feel so ripped off, and disgusted that I am not even sure what to do at this point. I could have filed my own taxes for free at home, and gotten them back by now. The question I have now is how is H&R Block going to compensate me? Make this right with the customers, or are we such "small fries", that this will continue with no recourse?
I can't believe I was charged $327 by H&R Block to file my taxes. The kicker for me was I started online on their website and had trouble with a couple forms and made an appointment. Well, all my info that I had entered at home carried over to the H&R Block office and the lady made a few typing corrections. I think some of that charge should have been waived, considering I entered probably 98% of the information for them.
I have used H&R Block for years. I know prices have gone up but I can't believe what I was charged. My taxes are real simple except for that extra form for the deduction for the taxes on my house and the interest on my loan on the house. I can't believe clicking on the computer a couple of extra times can cost $240. I was there less than half an hour. I don't know and pretty much feel this note will not be read by anyone that cares to do anything. However, I just feel better. I also will never tell anyone to use H&R Block again and make sure I tell everyone I know never to go to H&R Block. I have been there for the last time. Not that one person makes a difference to you right now but if I stop another than me and they stop another.
On February 9th, I walked into the H&R Block nearest to my place of work (55 John Street) hoping to file my taxes for 2011. You see, the city of New York has made an agreement with H&R Block stating that individuals who made under $41,000 in 2011 and who have dependents are eligible to file their taxes for $29 with a sponsored coupon. I was greeted by a young girl who was sitting at the front desk and who took down my information. Very pleasant and polite, she passed on my information to a tax preparer who was also very pleasant and all smiles, that is, until I mentioned to her that I was interested in the promotion listed on the city sponsored coupon. It was then that this woman's attitude went from very friendly and polite to dismissive and short. Since I did not have my coupon printed, she could not see me stating that I would need to pay up front and when I offered to return to her with the printed coupon, she told me to go elsewhere. Not letting her poor attitude get to me and not letting me make quick judgments, I decided to give H&R Block another shot and this time, I met with a new tax preparer and a new front desk person on February 13th, 2012 who were also very friendly and eager to assist until I explained that the $29 coupon is what led me to their office. As soon as I sat down and I mentioned the coupon, the tax preparer rolled her eyes and her entire attitude changed. She expressed her annoyance over the fact that this coupon is being offered and she kept asking (at least three times within the 20 minutes I sat down with her) me whether or not I thought that $29 for her services was too little; all the while there are other staff and customers in the office. The tax preparer did not seem interested in the least to help me with my taxes. She did not answer my questions and she kept trying to get me to agree to a tax credit I know I did not qualify for. It got to the point where this woman's unprofessionalism and money hungry ways (apparently she makes a commission preparing taxes and my $29 wasn't good enough for her) were just so blatant and so disrespectful that I could no longer take it and I asked to speak to a manager. Unfortunately, the manager was not in the office at the time. I was so humiliated and so embarrassed that I had to force myself not to break down and cry. I expressed to the tax preparer how important it is for me to get my taxes done in a timely manner and why paying $29 would help me since I am a single mother. My tax preparer then decided to inform me that she was planning on writing a letter to Michael Bloomberg, Mayor of NYC, to inform him why this coupon is an inconvenience to her. I then informed her that while she writes her letter to Mayor Bloomberg, I would be filing a complaint with H&R Block's corporate office and with Consumer Affairs and that she should seek another employer who doesn't have this kind of agreement. As a working professional, I understand the meaning of making a living and I totally get she makes a certain percentage off of whatever the customer pays; however, as a customer service professional, you need to be empathetic and sensitive towards the consumer because you are providing a service. I have never used H&R Block in the past. This was my very first and last experience with this company. I work Monday through Friday full time and attend school evenings and weekends full time as well, all the while I am raising a small child on my own. I did not need nor did I deserve to be treated this way. Whatever happened to "service with a smile" and "the customer is always right"? I have filed a complaint with their corporate headquarters and I will be taking my taxes elsewhere.
I filed my income tax with H&R block on 1/26/2012. I was told the money would be on the emerald card by 2/8/2012. On 2/10/2012, I called H&R block and they told me it would be there by 2/13/2012. It wasn't. On 2/15/2012, I went back up to H&R block to inquire about my refund. They basically told me that I will get it when I get it. I am very displeased with the service I have gotten, and I still have not gotten my refund.
I went to H & R Block and had my taxes done. Well, I had 2 W2s and a 1099 I had received for doing side work. She entered that I was a small business owner! I ended up paying $337 because she messed up and now they will not fix the problem!
Went to H & R Block to do my taxes like I do every year. I usually get the rapid refund for around $250, but they no longer offer the rapid refund, so I figured it would cost me a lot less since I was not getting that much back anyway. I spent about an hour there and the lady told me my refund amount and then she told me the charges. I nearly fell over in my chair when she said $400. That was a 1/3 of my refund amount. She said that was the price for the forms and preparation. I feel ripped-off and I will never go there again. I have been getting my taxes done from them since 2000. $400, that is close to how much I pay for rent every month. To top it off, I am a single mother going to school and I am unemployed at the moment.
I went to H&R Block to have my taxes done and I couldn't believe the price jumped up over a $100 from last year. And then the agent spent most of my time answering the phone. Never will I have them do my taxes again or recommend anyone to go to them. It’s not like I am a big business with a lot of paper work to do. Just two people retired!
I went to an H&R Block office on February 7, 2012 and on the paperwork they told me I would receive my money on or around February 15, 2012. They sent me an email on February 15, 2012 telling me that there is a delay with refunds due to the IRS. I called H&R Block's customer service line and they said my new return date was going to be February 23, 2012. I then went to the IRS website and they quoted my date being February 28, 2012. I called back H&R Block's customer service line and they still quoted me the 23rd of February. I told them what the IRS website said and they told me to go by that date instead of the date they gave me. In the paperwork that H&R Block gave me when I got my taxes done they guarantee your money in 7-14 days. Now it is going to be 3 weeks before I will receive my refund! Anyone who reads this: do not go to H&R Block to get your taxes done. They just tell you what you want to hear and quote you dates that are incorrect! I paid over $350 for their ** "services".
Tax preparation fees of almost $400.00! I did not realize, until it was too late that they charge by the form, and I have a lot of them. I had no idea that TurboTax has a version with all the forms I needed for under $100.00. So I let H&R Block do it. I opted for the Emerald Card. I was told when I got the H&R Block Emerald card that I could transfer the money in one fell swoop. This is true, but it costs you $25.00 to do so. I was not told this. It costs money to check balances at the ATM; it costs money to get money from the ATM. My refund did not come in time to pay off the Emerald Card before it was due. I called the call center to pay off the account on time and was told I had to go to either Wells Fargo, Bank of America, or US Bank to do it. I went to all 3. They knew nothing of this. I went to the local H&R Block office. I was then told I had to go to Wal-Mart and buy a card for more money, load it with the money, and then I could pay off the account or use Western Union which again costs money. The only option that would not cost me more money is to send a check, which will now cost me more money because it is late. H&R Block have been doing my taxes for 20 years. Never ever again.
I had an appointment that an ad was running, saying $99, however no price was spoken until the end, and I was hit with a $329 fee, another $30 fee for interest, or some **. I was told my taxes would be back on a certain day. That day has come and been gone, after I questioned it. I was told it wasn't their fault, and to wait another 7 to 14 days, but I paid. Now, after the long wait, some weeks, I checked and it's another amount. Not what's on my paperwork. I called the IRS, and there was no problem. I called them. I guess you know I waited over 8 hours, before I got a call back, only to say we don't know what happened, or where your money went. Up until this date, there wasn't even a call, and $800 gone. I don't owe money to IRS or anyone, but all they can say is, it's not our fault. Finally, IRS called. They messed up the e-file info, but they keep denying that, but I won't rest until this is resolved, and after 18 years, I will never ever use their services, and I will tell others, however, I see I'm not the only one with these experiences. H&R block has been ripping off the poor for too long. They have no sympathy, no remorse, no apologies, no discount or anything for their errors. I'm not gonna accept that.
I went in on Feb. 1st, 2012, and was told I would receive my refund on an Emerald card by Feb 15, 2012, and I was told about the fee. I received my refund, just like they told me, and I was able to withdraw the money and deposit it in my bank (just like they told me I could). The fee to transfer was around $15.00. For me, H&R Block did as they said.
My son's family went to you. The guy did short form for both, state and Federal. And he was charged $250.00. That is crazy! How can you take that much money for about 1 hour of work from a young couple starting out. I hope you can sleep at night for taking that kind of money from people. I'm going to make sure I tell as many people as possible. You will never get any of our money again.
Filed State and Federal simple forms charged for each entry including $22.00 on $1500.00 unemployment. Total charges $237.00 asked for itemization of charges was told by preparer. He could not give a print out. This is unacceptable. Why is this allowed? I would have walked out and filed returns myself if I knew I could refuse to have them file. I was also told if I had the fee for the service deducted from my return H&R Block charges another fee. Wait I said, I have money in the bank and wrote a check. They wanted me to sign up for some emerald plan additional $33 for what (?) it was not explained to me. I declined this fee. I will tell everyone I know to avoid H&R Block. I will file my taxes myself next year and save the expense of the H&R typist.
I have been working on my free-file for hours, but the programming is so bad. I cannot e-file and I can't make changes. There are glitches that keep entering that I have to claim Jury Duty payments received which is inaccurate! And also glitches that keep saying that I have to claim gambling wins, which is also inaccurate! The thing is saying completed & that I have to mail it in! I am furious! I do not want the final version of the H & R block tax file & want to make changes & e-file. I am going round & round with this! I am so pissed off right now! And I have no intention of mailing my tax filing in! They also are having a problem e-filing! Also it is prompting me to clear up an error, but it will not bring me to the error to fix! Aaagh! Hours of this crap! And now it saying my return is complete!
My husband and I got our taxes done last year with H&R and it was expensive ($220). We did get our money quick and the man who did it was helpful and answered our questions. We said though we would not go back next year. Well, we made the mistake of going there this year again. We thought since we had a baby this year and they new all our information, we would go again. For starters, we got there at 5:20, 10 minutes before our appointment with a baby in hand. Well, we waited 50 minutes for the girl to show up! We were not walk-ins. We had an appointment. I was about to leave and I should have. An hour and a half later, our taxes were done and guess how much our bill was with it deposited into our bank account. $ 380. We were about to leave and we were told as well we could not. They tried saying that they charge per form now! The worst part is this is not the worst part. We went into the office on 1/25/2012. One week later, I called because the IRS was not showing any information. No response from them. A week later, I called again and was told it was never filled! Wow. Really? I was told that the girl never had a senior worker sign it. Now, they just changed my direct deposit date to the 25, a month to the date we filed. I have tried to contact their main office. I do not think I should have to pay for any of their services since they are guaranteed certainly not for the direct deposit. Do not waste your time or money with these people. Next year, I am going to an accountant.
A simple form cost me $185.00, last year $88.00. This year more simple will not go back, next year a rip-off.
I did my taxes with H&R Block on Jan 30,2012. They told me that the Emerald Card was the only fee-free way to receive my refund; so I got one. I was told my refund would be on my card by February 8, 2012, and it was not. I called them on the 8th. The woman who answered the phone told me I should go on the IRS website myself and check my refund status and was told that the funds may be deposited up until midnight. So, I waited and checked the website where the message said they had no information. The morning of the 9th, I called again and was connected with the lady who did my refund personally. She gave me half-hearted apologies and told me again to go on the IRS website and to call the IRS if the website had no info. After still receiving no info from the IRS webpage, I did break down and call the number where I was told my wait would be at least twenty minutes and that agents had no more info than what was provided on the site. An automated message at the toll-free IRS number also stated that the minimum processing time for online refunds was 10 to 21 days, when H&R promised it in 9 days. After an unnecessary amount of legwork on my part and a statement from H&R Block that there was nothing they could do and it was the IRS and they "really don't know how to apologize any more," I waited again. Finally, on the 14th at 1am, I received my refund. After speaking with friends and family who did not use H&R Block, they received their refunds sooner and filed later. It's the IRS, huh? I don't think so. I paid $287 to get extremely poor customer service and was never offered a discount, refund, or any other than very poor apologies and suggestions on what work I should be doing to deal with the IRS. Never again H&R Block!
The last 3 years my wife and I have had our taxes done by our local H&R Block. Usually the first time we had a wonderful experience. It cost us almost $300that year but what we were getting was a refund within days of the IRS accepting our return. Last year wasn't so nice. It took longer and the "expert" wasn't so swift and it was a couple of hours for something that should have been a very simple task, but again we were getting the anticipation loan and supporting our local economy because it is very hard to get by here on the Oregon coast. This year we were given the same explanation of the refund with the exception of they had changed when they sent in the returns, instead of every other week which caused a delay due to which week you filed in and if the IRS accepted your refund. This year we were told they were sending in returns every day. We filed our taxes on February 3rd and our return was accepted on the 3rd. When I called to inquire why the transfer hadn't gone through they said that I wasn't supposed to get my return until the 15th, maybe later depending on the IRS. Then they couldn't explain why I had paid $295 after a $20 off coupon which would have been fine if I was getting a refund anticipation loan. But they informed me that despite the excessive cost and paper work that is eerily similar in "wording" about their refund anticipation policy, they no longer due the anticipation loans and I wouldn't get my money until the IRS said that they were sending the money into H&R's account. I tried calling multiple 800 numbers and including a number that was supposed to be for the corporate office. All I've been able to get out of them is that they don't do it and they don't know what the rates were or why I paid so much to do what would have cost considerably less (and I could have avoided sitting an uncomfortable chair for an hour and a half). They gave me a case number and told me someone from escalations would call me some time. I guess whenever they get around to it. I will never use them again and I want what I paid for or to be refunded the cost of getting my refund whenever they get it from the IRS.
I am appalled at the fee that H&R Block has just charged me. It is almost three times what I have paid for other professional services in the past 20 years. They get you by estimating a low fee. Once they prepare the return, you are hooked. I will never go there again!
Both I and my girlfriend had our taxes done through H&R Block. We both had probably the stupidest so-called "Tax Professional". It took them over an hour to do my taxes and almost 2 hours to do my girlfriend’s. We both had simple taxes. We thought by going to them that it would be better. I was charged over $200 to do mine and she was charged $178. Soon after having out taxes done we checked online to find out that TurboTax can do the same thing for only $66. We called H&R Block to try to stop everything but they said, "We are sorry it is already sent and in the main frame. Sorry." We then called customer support and they said, “We cannot do anything, we are just here to direct you to and H&R Block Tax Professional.” Well they have lost our business and we strongly recommend that you go to someone else or do your own online. H&R Block you suck and you are a scam!
I went to my local office to get my taxes done. The tax person told me it might be around $100.00 and I told her okay. At the end, she tells me my total that I owe is $201.00. My jaw dropped. I was upset but had to pay for services rendered. I don't think that is right to have to pay that much. I will not be going back to them again. Very dissatisfied. I would like to speak to someone about this.
I went to H&R Block this year, because I had a coupon for a free 1040EZ tax return. Well, since I had child care credit, the coupon was not acceptable. The charge was outrageous, and I will never go to them again, and I will let everyone else know what kind of a ripoff company they are. I am a single mother of three children, and need every penny I can get. They charged me $321 plus $55 to have it deposited into my account. Where does the $55 come into play? It doesn't cost anything to have your money direct deposited. I will be sending a letter to the Better Business Bureau. I could have gone to a CPA, and my charges would have been much less. I am now waiting on my refund. I wonder how long that will take! They take advantage of taxpayers. I called and complained, and of course, they will do nothing! I'm sure they won't be in business much longer, if word gets out like I plan on doing.
H&R Block have an ad on channel 6 in Bozeman, MT. It claims that if you file your taxes by the end of February, they are free. Not so. I had a simple form and it cost me $178 and when I asked why, the preparer said, "Oh, our manager opted no to do that." I said how can that be when it is advertised on TV. His reply was, "I wish I could help you but that is the way it is." I told him that is false advertising.
Heather knew that I and my wife were not together and that my wife would take my check and not let me have my part so she agreed that she would not release the check unless we were both present. She ended up letting my wife have my check without me being there and now my wife has cashed the check and not even let me see any of the money.
HR & Block in Pequannock demonstrates poor customer service. Simple tax return is free as advertised. I called to confirm not realizing there was a fee for the state return. It was not communicated for state there was a fee until already in the process of filing the return. It was my 18-year old son's first time, who has no experience in filing taxes and was told that he would have to pay in addition to the state return fee, bank fees from him his direct deposit refund for not having the payment. He was not prepared as he was misled to believe the tax filing was free. The manager was unwilling to make an exception as a courtesy to waive the fee or reimburse us. She insisted he was told. She refused to budge. I would never go to HR.
I normally do my income tax filing online with TurboTax. I did it at home and found out I had to pay in so I figured I was doing something wrong. Well, after listening to the commercials on TV about H&R Block, I decided to call. Well, they came up with the same results I did but it cost me $249 to file. I was shocked. I figured because she took the time to go through them, I had to pay. I was and still am very pissed off! I then went home and re-processed (didn't send in) my taxes on TurboTax and H&R Block. Both were going to charge me less than $90. I then called H&R back and said I wanted a refund! They said there was nothing they could do as my taxes have been processed. No, an unacceptable answer! I am continuing to argue this. I will never go to them again nor will I refer them to anyone!
I went in to a local H&R Block office to have my taxes prepared in Jan 2012 (as I have had done the past two years). I sat down with the lady and explained to her that my husband and I had our W-2s but that I did not yet have my form 1098-T from college to file on. The previous year, the same lady filed my taxes for me and simply did an amendment later on, to add my 1098-T forms and said that it was no problem if we did things that way. So, I asked her to do the same for me this year, which would mean getting part of my refund back immediately and the other part (for tuition) back within the next couple of months. At first, she agreed to do this. However, later on in the sitting, she decided to go ahead and put a "guesstimate" amount in for my tuition charges. She filed my taxes with this amount and told me to contact her whenever my 1098-T form came in online and to let her know what the actual amounts were. Whenever I called her to tell her the actual amounts, she proceeded to tell me that she over estimated and that I would need to pay back around $221.00 to the IRS and that she would start working on the amendment for me right away, so that we could get the problem taken care of. About two weeks later, (after my tax money has been put into a new vehicle and home repairs), she called to inform me that she messed up more than she thought and that now I would be looking at owing the IRS around $2,000.00! I am livid. She proceeded to stumble and stammer on her words and tell me "I just don't know how I came up with the amount we filed for." I don't have this kind of money and I'm sure most people don't. I'm hoping the IRS will work out some sort of payment plan with me. I don't know what to do. H&R Block sure isn't helping.
I went to H&R Block at 4300 Sonoma Blvd. in Vallejo, Ca. in January 2011 to have my income tax prepared and I paid $250.00 for that. Its okay since I have had them prepared my income tax there every year for four years. As soon as the preparer saw my refund, she asked me if I wanted to avail of the Emerald Card to save me $35.00. I asked if there is a charge for that, she said no. I asked if I can withdraw money from it, and she said yes again. Yes, she retrieved the disclosure form (in fine prints and was about three pages long) asked me to sign which I did, thinking she would print a copy for me and put it in my records. I asked again if I could transfer it to my account, all at one time. And she said YES. I used it at Wal-Mart to buy a $25.00 worth of groceries, it was okay. But when I went to the B. A. counter to transfer the balance to my savings account, the teller said they could not do that, because that could only be done at the atm. I used the ATM and it read that the bank charges $2.50 in addition to card institution charges. When I called H&R block emerald card the representative told me these; Every time I used the card to buy something or get cash from an ATM they charge $25.00. I cannot believe H&R block can do this. Beware this particular H&R block is not licensed. Anyway, I filed a complaint at the California board of complaints. Also, my son signed up for the peace of mind services (they will take care of any errors that may have been made on the tax returns.) they did not. This is not the time to steal people's money. Many people like me are now unemployed and suffering.
I went to get my tax done, 1040ez with one dependent. They charged me $220, which was ridiculously expensive. I was not happy about the charge, hope if there is any amendments of tax, or audit, they will not charge me any penny.
When I visited the H&R Block, the person who started preparing the tax never gave me any idea of how much it would cost. First point and next just for filing a federal tax having just interest income the cost they are charging is $99 which is ridiculous. For tax filing, $51. I have not paid them and not planning to file through them.
H&R Block has been doing my taxes for 16 years now. It has always been a bit expensive, but we felt it was worth it to have 'professionals' handle it and save us the headache of figuring it all out and the heartache if we did it wrong. We now realize that we have been ** ourselves these 16 years. A chimp can fill out a simple tax return like ours and we've been paying some fat cat to do it. This year they charged us twice what we were charged last year, secured a return of less than half of what we received last year, and promised us that we would receive our refund no later than the 6th of February, which was 4 times longer than last year! It is now the 11th and we still haven't received a dime. This year I have resolved to quit allowing myself to be robbed by fat cat down-pressers. I am so sick of it. I have pulled the plug on T-Mobile this year, Commerce Bank, Sprint, my landlords (trying to figure out how to quit paying utilities, too), and H&R Block--you are on notice and your services will no longer be required. And I'll be sure to "tell a friend" or a thousand! How's that for telling you something good? Bloodsuckers!
I got my taxes done at an H&R Block office. They wanted to charge me $354.00. Then the manager came over and told me that they could cut it down to $290.00. What a joke! As many people that file their taxes with H&R Block, they could cut down the cost a little more than that. Then I filed on Feb. 1, they told me that I would have my taxes back by Feb. 8 and I still haven;t heard anything. The funny thing is that was for federal, I had to file state as well and had that sent to me in check form and I have already received it. I will not file taxes with H&R ever again!
Every year my fees go up at H & R Block. I complained about it, but continued to go. Today I was charged $209.00 to do my tax returns. Now last year, I was charged $200.00 because I waited so late and was told they charge more during the time period (in April). Whatever. Well, here it is ** February and I'm being charged even more. This time I was told it was because of my HSA (Health savings) form. I have that every year! Anyway, I took all my papers and got up and left. They've just lost me as a customer. They are liars, cheaters and in fact, a couple years ago, one of their employees stole my wallet when I left it there. Needless to say, the employee denied it and my wallet was never found.
I filed my taxes on Jan. 21st. I was told I would get it on my card on or by the 8th. On the 9th, I finally had to call the IRS myself to find out my tax return was rejected! And did I receive a phone call by H and R Block? No! I had to go in to find out they entered my daughter social in wrong (their fault)! Then, I got told by the office manager that they would call me at 10 a.m to let me know if my taxes were accepted. 1:00 pm came and still, I received no phone call. So, I called to speak with her. What do you know? She was not in the office! She wouldn’t be back in until 2 or 3! I have done my taxes with Amscot for 3 years now and have never had a problem. Let’s just say I will not be going back to H and R Block. And I will tell everyone I know and at my job about their service. On top of it, do they offer any kind of discount for their mistake? No! I am totally disgusted and angry about their work ethic. They should not be allowed to do anyone's taxes. This is the H and R Block on 14th St., West Bradenton, FL in Bay Shore plaza!
My wife and I filed a joint income tax return. We indicated that we were interested in filing the 1040EZ as it was advertised to be a free filing. We sat with the preparer during the process, which took approximately 30 minutes. Most of this time consisted of waiting for the preparer to click through the screens, sign our name electronically, etc. Then there was a mistake. All this information had to be re-entered. So much for being fast. When the filing was completed, the preparer asked us how we wanted to pay. We indicated again that we requested to file the 1040EZ for the free filing. The preparer stated that because we had received a dividend, the long form had to be filed. At this time, the branch manager had overheard the conversation and walked into the cubicle. The branch manager then confirmed that the taxes had to be filed on the long form because of the dividend. The dividend in question was in the amount of $111.00 which was from a class action lawsuit my wife was involved in years ago. H & R Block was now requesting a payment of $140.00 because the long form had to be filed. We discussed this fee with the preparer and the branch manager. Evidently, there is nothing they could do. The long form had to be filed and we owed $140.00. They would take cash or check then for the $140 or we could have it taken out of our refund, at which time they would recoup a service fee of $35. Nice job H & R Block. You lost my business & hopefully the business of all those who would talk to me.
I filed my tax return on January 27th and paid for RAL. I thought the emerald card would get it faster for me but I can't find out nothing. They have been telling me for over a week that it has been accepted by the IRS. Everyone I work with who filed before or after me has already received their returns. I have called several times; the staff is rude and basically no help at all. I will never use H&R Block again.
I am a single mother and work for a church, so to say the least I need every penny I can get and faster is always better. I chose to file my taxes with H&R Block because they advertised low fees and fast refunds. The representative who assisted me was to say the least not very bright. She was no more versed in tax laws than myself. I had to watch every number she put in and correct her more than once. The few questions I had she could not answer. I was not told how much I was going to be charged for my filing my taxes until she was finished and it was too late to back out. I was also told that I would receive my refund within 7-14 business days. Conclusion: I was charged around $260 to file and an extra $35 in bank fees because my refund had to go through their bank before it could come to mine (this could also take an extra 4 days). If I had filed with Turbo Tax I would have only paid $30 to file and the return would have come directly to my bank account making it a lot faster! I ended up waiting more than 3 weeks for my return and paying an extra $265 just to have some idiot plug numbers into an idiot proof program. H&R Block should be sued for false advertising. There is no such thing as an RAC (refund anticipation check)!
I filed my taxes on January 31st 2012. I was told that my return will be here around February 8th which is documented on my paperwork that had been given to me by the individual who filed my taxes. I then get an email from H & R Block that I should have my return around February 15, 2012. I called H & R Block and they tell me that they are not responsible for what the IRS does. I then looked up my tax return through the IRS and their records indicate that I will receive my refund around February 21, 2012. So much for 7-14 business days, I will be contacting a lawyer to get my $300 and change back for false advertisement and ripping people off. I guarantee that this company will eventually go under.
I had an appointment and went in to get taxes done. The person that helped me told me it would probably be around $100.00. I kind of cringed but said okay. At the end, it was $201.00. I was very upset but had to pay for services rendered. I will never go through H&R Block again. That was outrageous.
I filed my taxes 2/2011 at H&R Block office Cedar Rapids Westdale Mall by Melinda **. I had just purchased a home and asked Melinda how I could keep my money during the year since I needed it more during the year. Keep in mind I am single, in my late 50s and living paycheck to paycheck. My budget is very tight. Knowing my situation, she advised me to go 5 allowances during the year and I would be just fine. She printed me out the form to give to my employer to make sure I did it correctly. She was not doing taxes this year and the new person completed my taxes and informed me I have to pay in almost $1200.00 which is devastating to me. Plus, I have to reduce my W-4 to where I am not sure how to survive on the rest of what is left on my check. The new person apologized and said Melinda's head was not in the "game" as she was going through a divorce at the time. That helps me, how? Well, they offered as corporate about a discount on my cost of filing. Well, my credit card has been charged $145.00 and I heard nothing more.
We had H&R Block do our taxes because they advertised a faster tax return. After we completed our taxes, we were hit with an outrageous $250 filing fee. They filled a basic 1040 EZ and a 540. Ouch! We got the Emerald card because we were advised this would make our tax return even quicker. They gave us an expected date of February 1st 2012. We filed on the 24th of January 2012. It is now the 9th of February and according to the IRS website, they deposited the money on the 8th of February 2012. We still have nothing on the Emerald card and H&R block has been less than helpful even to the point of being rude. We would like a full refund of our money since the services H&R Block advertised they provided were not rendered. This has caused financial hardship for a family of six who needs every penny.
I have used a professional tax service for the last several years and paid for those services but got quality service. Around $500 a year. Just being recently separated I could use every penny, so I decided to use H&R because of all their misleading advertising. I thought it would be less expensive. I was wrong. And they don’t tell you until they file what you owe and everything you have seen is a lie. Big mistake using H&R. First of all that little poster they have on the wall as an estimate of what you will pay is a total lie. After I told the lady what I paid last year her exact words where they got you. Well, she tried to skip over everything and I had to tell her to go back and add my deductions. Well, to fast forward, my total fees were $505 with the $15 coupon. What a joke! So to use her words, H&R really got me!
I used H&R’s website to check our refund status, their phone service, and looked at the IRS web service. I learned that the IRS had direct deposited our on 2-7-12. According to H&R our funds were to be ready on or about 2-8. Since the IRS had already deposited our refund I then called customer support in see if there was a problem or when the money would be made available. The support rep did not ask for any identifying information and told me, "Um…You'll just have to wait it out." We paid $275 for HR to prepare and file our taxes and this is the type of support service we got. We still don't have our money and our questions are still unanswered. I posted my problem to H&R’s Facebook page and someone replied and told me to send an email. I did and that is still unanswered. I will never return to H&R. It's ridiculous to pay someone to lie and be rude to you.
I went to H&R Block to get my taxes done. The tax preparer said I need all kind of different forms to file my taxes and never gave me a total until he finished. To make a long story short the forms he used ate up my whole refund including their fees. I was devastated and he charged me $300 plus extra for the forms. They give you no options. I wish these business would spell out every cost to the consumer before taking them for a ride. It is a rip off. I recommend them to no one ever.
I paid H&R Block to prepare my taxes and I paid to receive my taxes in 7 to 14 days. The IRS said they deposited my refund and H&R Block says that they have not received it. They told me that they don't know when they will receive it and that when they get the money. It will be another 4 days before they will deposit it into my account. Yet they are still taking their $383.00 even though it has already been 3 weeks and I don't have my refund. They have broken their contract and yet they still expect to be paid for a service that they did not provide. If I would have wanted to wait to get my refund, I could have filed my taxes for free or at least a lot less than H&R Block is charging. I am on a military base and there are literally soldiers complaining everywhere we go about the service they received from H&R Block.
I am being charged $228 to file a 1040A form. I don't itemize or anything. I was told because I had EIC, I get that every year. It’s a short easy form to add in. That is more than people pay who own homes and itemize and have two and three jobs.
It is costing me $261.00 this year for H&R Block to do my taxes and that is with there $20 coupon. This in my opinion is crazy. My girlfriend and I will not use H&R Block anymore. That is a crazy price jump from last year and I think it's a lot of my hard earned money to be paying for a easy 10 minute job, a few clicks of a mouse.
My husband and I have used H&R Block for several years. But this will definitely be the last time. I just found out that our refund check has been lost. But apparently it was sent to the wrong office Wednesday, February 1, 2012 and when it was sent to the correct office Friday, February 3, 2012 the check has been lost. We were never notified of this and the only way I was able to find out was to call again today, Tuesday, February 7, 2012. When I asked them why they didn't void the original check and print a new one I was told that they did not know how to do it and to call back when the manager comes in this afternoon. So now I am waiting to hear from someone regarding this **. Hopefully, I will get my check by the end of this week, although it should be reissued to us today. I called the 1800 number and filed a complaint but was told that it could take up to 3 days to hear back. And they had the nerve to say that at least the check wasn't cashed.
I was told that if I took the card to my bank and deposited it all at once there would be no fee. That was a lie. They want $25.00 for that. I then called the 1800 number to complain and was told that if I went to an Apoint in CVS store I could withdraw my money with no fee. Another lie. The Apoint has no fee but if you withdraw any money at any ATM you have to pay the HR Block Bank $2.50. This was never told to me when I accepted the damn card. No matter what you do with it they charge you. They even charge a dollar to check the balance. This is ** and someone needs to do something.
I went to them to file my taxes and paid for what was to be a anticipation loan. My brother, he just went online to Taxact, only $18.00 filed everything and was told exactly what day he would have received a check and it showed up 2 days earlier than they said. Meanwhile, I feel that HR Block has lied to a lot of people by saying the system is running slow! Really? I don't think so. I know of several who did Taxact online and received their money in just a few days. I will never ever pay that much money to do our taxes again. I have been lied to by them one to many times!
My husband is currently deployed overseas, and I had to use a power of attorney to be able to file jointly with him as primary. I had H&R Block put our refund on the Emerald Card due to the representative telling me I would not have any trouble using the card. I tried to access my refund account information online and was rejected. It stated that I didn't have the correct information. I had to put in the card number and a PIN. Of course, I wrote down my PIN on my tax return paperwork to ensure that i wouldn't forget. I tried to enter the information over and over until it finally locked me out. I then called the 1-866-353-1266 that is stated on the back of the card. Once I spoke to a representative, they then told me they couldn't tell me anything because I wasn't the primary. I offered to give all any information to the representative, but the rep refused to provide any information, even though he knew my husband is deployed and I had a power of attorney and I filled with him. He then told me to call the IRS or visit their website. I am furious. Not to mention my tax associate didn't look like she knew what the hell she was doing and refused to see all my receipts to turn in for deductions. I feel I was lied to by H&R Block when they promised to get me my full refund and/or at least try to and lied about my card.
I went home after H&R and looked at my taxes. My school said I was getting $925 back. What is wrong with this? Wrong H&R. No one gets that amount so I took it in this morning and no phone call at all and then I called this guy I talk to. Well, let's just say he did not no anything. How long should this take? And do you have anyone that has any idea how to do taxes in Bryan area for real? I am very upset with all this.
In 2010, we had H&R Block prepare our 2009 taxes. I keep questioning a 1099-C we had received that they wanted to omit. I even had the preparer ask a manager. In May of 2011, we received a letter from the IRS stating we did not report it. I immediately called H&R Block and showed them the letter and my taxes they prepared. They said, since I didn't get the "Peace of Mind" I was responsible. I said what is that and why was I never offered it? They said, I declined it. I argued that I signed a paper for my refund, not knowing it was to decline the "Peace of Mind". So, the owner sent me a letter offering to do my taxes for free for 2011. I thought we would give them a second shot at this, since it was not going to cost me. Well, I went on 2/3/12 to file, had a 1099-C again, they input it this time but they did not know what they were doing. On 2/4/12 I got a phone call from H&R Block saying, they received a message form the IRS, that the 1099-C was done incorrectly and I would have to amend my taxes after I got my refund. Of course, they said they would do this for free, but I also bought the "Peace of Mind" this year. The more I think about it, the more is gets me frustrated with them. I should get my $35.00 fee for the "Peace of Mind" back! I will use TaxAct from now on.
I received a “Personal Income Tax Preassessment Notice” for PA Department of Revenue on Jan. 30, 2012 regarding my 2010 PA tax return. I owe tax, interest and penalty because the tax software did not include in my gross compensation amounts reported in boxes 12c. I called the IRS and they indicated that unlike the fed return, we must include amount in 12c--it is not deducted from total gross. This is the second time TaxCut software from HR Block miscalculated my return. First time in 2009 for the fed return. I filed electronically to RS and PA both all years. The software will not allow you to file electronically if we override anything. I checked all entries from W2 to the software and they were accurate. Each time I called HR Block to get them to pay the interest and penalty (they guarantee calculations), you are on the phone for 20 minutes minimum. Then you have to fax your completed fed and state return to them along with IRS letters and explanation. They will not allow you to redact your Social Security Numbers! Then it will take 6 weeks for them to review to determine if you have a valid claim. I can not get to speak with anyone who knows anything or can make a decision. Can not even email it. And they do not reimburse the cost of faxing them many pages I have even if they determine it was their calculate error. I will never use their software again and I will make sure all of my colleagues do not use it either.
I have been spending about 14 hours, off and on, inputting my personal data into the online browser web link for their Deduction Pro add on. My data file is stored on my desktop. Each time, I would browse the file location, and reopen the file that I have been working on, and pick up where I left off. Today, I attempted to go in, and finish my data input, only to find out that the program would not allow me to open the data file. A dialogue box opened, advising me that my data file was now too large for the browser edition to open, and that I must "purchase" the Deduction Pro Software at **. I went to that site, and it took me directly to the same window that the tax preparation program took me to open my existing file. I contacted the online chat technical support desk. Nicole was very quick in responding. After 45 minutes of exchanges, it was determined that this is a problem that H&R Block is aware of, and that there is no known fix, or any plan for a fix. There is no stand-alone Deduction Pro 2011 software to download, and when you get to a point where your data is too large, you can no longer open it to complete further additions or edits, once it is closed. The options they gave me, was to: (1) import the partial data into my tax return, and then manually edit and add additional data without the aid of the Deduction Pro software, and the item valuation calculator or; (2) create a new deduction data file, and start from scratch, re-inputting all of my data, about 14 hours of work repeated, without closing the program before importing the data to the tax preparation program or; (3) send back the software for a full refund of the purchase price. I was further advised that there are no plans to fix this problem, no plans to create the "Stand Alone Program" their dialogue box was referring me to, and no plans to increase the data file size threshold on the online browser version that is linked to the tax preparation software. Though they were willing to give me my money back, it doesn't reimburse me for the time I have wasted in inputting my tax data and deductions, thus far. At this point, I do not know which option I will take to resolve my issue. I do need to file my taxes. I can take the time and re-enter all of my data and use their program without closing it, to get the full benefit of the intent of the software. I can import what I have, and then manually finish my tax preparation without the benefit of the software that I have purchased, or I can take the refund, and buy another product, and start from scratch, or just box up my records, and take them to a CPA, and pay them to do it all for me! I just want to save others from wasting their time, and ending up in the same mess that I am. Bottom line: if you are using Deduction Pro 2011, do not close the file and attempt to save your data before you finish the full input of your data, as you may not be able to open it again later.
I called the H&R Block in Edmond, OK on Sunday morning, February 5th, 2012, at around 11:00 AM. I was told by a lady named Georgenanna that they were not busy, and I could walk-in and be seen. They are located east of the intersection of **, and their phone number is **. When I arrived, an older preparer named Jan ** was sitting alone, and gave me a condescending look as I entered the door. She asked me, with a negative tone and scowl, if I had called in advance, or made an appointment, and a host of other questions. I explained that I had just spoken with Georgenanna, but Jan kept making excuses, was hesitant, and asked a lot of questions, for appointment arrangement details, and dragging on as if there was some issue with seeing me. I asked her if they took walk-ins, and she said yes (which baffled me). She was not busy, and didn't indicate she had an appointment. Personally, I didn't get the impression she was enthused about seeing or serving a black man. After she kept rambling for excuses, I said please disregard my visit, I apologize, I will take my business elsewhere. I called back minutes later (around noon) to speak with Georgeanna or the office manager (or owner), but Jan answered, and told me there was no local owner, and that H&R Block was a national organization. She told me the others were busy, and she asked me what I needed. I asked her to just disregard my call. I'll just try to contact a regional/or national office. This is the first, and worst experience I have ever had with any H&R Block. There is no way I would trust such a person with my taxes, nor would I refer anyone of color to that H&R Block location. I've been contemplating contacting the BBB also. Now, I left the office in a respectful manner, but inside, felt highly upset and disrespected about the whole experience. Who can I talk to?
The employees there do not listen when you tell them your concerns and issues. I went in for an Emerald Advance, and due to the tax preparer's error, we were denied. She told us multiple times that she would fix it. We went back a week later to be pushed off to a later date. One week later, we went back in, and she told us it was the bank when we knew all along (due to her admitting it) that it was her error. So yet another week later, we went in and really needed the money. I had to physically go up there, because we could not get her to return our phone call. Her excuse was she had the flu and was in the back--lamest excuse ever to not return a phone call. Anyhow, I was so disgusted with this that I called the corporate line and was contacted by an office 80 miles away. The people at this office fixed her error and got us the loan 5 weeks later! Next, we vowed not to go back to this store and that the taxes would be filed at another location. The day of our appointment, some things went array. My husband and I swallowed our pride and made a decision that we needed the taxes done, due to him going out of town for work for an extended period of time. We called the office in Redwood (thinking there was another tax preparer) and were greeted very nicely. The receptionist told us that it shouldn't be a problem and that she would call me back in 2 hours. So I wait. At just about 2 hours, the people from the store 80 miles away called my cell phone, asking how I was, etc. The man then asked me about calling the Redwood store. I explained the circumstances to him, and he said, "Well, I don't see it being a problem, but the employees contacted me to talk to you to make sure that you would do no physical harm or have an attitude with them." Seriously?! Let me make something clear! At no time over the period of 5 weeks did I ever cuss at these people or "get an attitude" or do physical harm to anyone or anything. I have never been so appalled at a situation. The man apologized but said he had to make sure. Well, let's just say I will never ever go back to H&R Block again!
I was upset because they charging me a lot of money. I have done them several times but never again. Their fees are ridiculous.
We filed our taxes over a month ago and we were supposed to get our state refund direct deposited to our bank account in 2 to 4 days. We still haven't received it. Our federal refund was supposed to be put on an Emerald card in 2 weeks & we still haven't received it either. We have used H&R Block for several years but we may not in the future because we have a lot of bills to be paid & I have no idea when we will get any money.
Dear H&R Block, I am writing this letter in hopes that you conduct your business better. I was a customer this year. My tax lady was horrible. I can't believe how horrible she made me feel in her office. I called them up H&R in Sunland CA and asked for an estimate for my taxes. I had 1 W2 and a prize form and that was it. They had me come in without giving me an estimation. I never did get one. It took my tax lady about 5 minutes to do taxes and she charged me a lot- $164 with a coupon and without the $35 protection. I noticed in her computer, she put 120 min for federal. If that's true, shouldn't she get fired for taking so long. It took her 1 minute. I was lied to in front of my face. She went so fast with my taxes and didn't teach me anything and would not give me an estimation of the cost. The cost kept rising. I also don't think she did them right and she explained nothing to me at all. She couldn't even get it to go through cause she kept putting in the computer that I was a gambler. I never gamble. She was messing with my taxes. I have never in my life paid more the $75 for taxes. My taxes were very, very simple and I truly believe she messed them up anyway. She never put my prize money information in. I will tell everybody I know about my situation and make a nice blog and post it around. I feel violated and every time I asked a question, she blew me off like, “Oh, don't worry about it.” Her associate who was working with her ended up having to finish filing it cause she couldn't. I paid $200 to file a W2, I only made $3000 in wages. I feel horrible about the situation and I feel like my taxes are all messed up now and it's because of horrible customer service. I had simple questions about W2 1099 and schedule that never got answered. I can't pay to have anyone review them to make sure they're right. I don't have the funds.
The H&R Block tax preparer did not deduct all my business expenses like gasoline and food. At first, she was going to charge me over $400, then she cut the cost to $362. I still think it was way too expensive. Many of my friend itemized their gasoline and food for personal expenses. She said that I cannot deduct gasoline and food during operating my business. H&R Block just just cost me. And I lost more money. It would be the end.
I have been a customer of H&R Block for about 15 years. This year, I have made my mind up to never file with them again. I was charged 300 dollars for my tax return. I was told if I use the Emerald Card, I would receive my money faster than direct deposit. Of course, I did just that. I have paid 300 dollars. I want my money quick as I can get it for that price. I still have not got my money and H&R Block doesn't have a clue when I will get it. Isn't that just bananas? If I provide you a service, the least I could do is give accurate information or none at all. I know it's up to the IRS but, please tell me this before you pretend to provide me something that I can do myself for about 39 dollars. Most of my friend used Tax Act, they have already received their money. One had a date from the IRS the same as I and she got her money today. So tell me what am I wasting my money for? Next year will be so different. I will use the eFile from the IRS. I guess they would be the head and not the tail. By the way, I filed on Jan. 29, 2012.
My husband and I had our taxes done at H&R Block for over 10 years when our consultant moved away. Another agent was recommended at a different location. We made our appointment for the evening. When we got there, we waited close to an hour and half for our preparer. Finally, she passed us on to another agent. We were not pleased with him at all. Several months later, we received a letter from the IRS. There were errors and we now had fees and owed money. We had the Peace of Mind guarantee so we took everything to H&R and we were told someone would be in contact. Days and weeks went by and nothing so I called. They had no record of our complaint so I sent them everything again. We were concerned the IRS would garnish my husband's wages. So we paid it. We submitted it to H&R Block and nothing. The next year, we got a call from H&R asking if we wanted to set up a time to get our taxes done. I said after what happened last time, no thank you. They said they were sorry. We just fell through the cracks and said if we ever wanted to return, they wanted us back and would give us a deep discount. That was three years ago. We had been happy the first 10 years so we thought about giving them another chance this year. So I called the Oak Creek office on Howell ave. The manager made me feel like I was a crook. She said she had been the manager for years and there had never been a problem with anyone's taxes so she has no idea what I was talking about. I told her I had the letter from the IRS. I had certified letters sent to them asking why they would not honor the guarantee, etc. She said (with attitude), "Well, I don't see how that could have happened but I will see if we can get you some type of discount," then hung up. I called back and said to forget it. It was bad enough they didn't honor their own guarantee but they basically called us liars even though I had a folder full of proof. I would say you get what you pay for but they are the most expensive place we have ever used, almost $300. We will just go back to the place we have been using the last few years. It's just it's hard to get in there but it is only $150 for the same taxes that H&R Block charges $300 to do.
HR Block is utilizing deceptive advertising practice when it comes to free e-file of federal returns with their basic softwares for individuals with qualifying incomes as stated on IRS website. Before the forms can be completed, they want to collect credit card information. This is unfair business practice. If they don't want to participate in free e-file program, they should remove their links from IRS website and stop advertising free e-file of federal returns. They never did it in previous years, only this year.
I have been filing my tax returns from Turbo Tax for two years. This year I checked on Turbo Tax and it was showing me that I had to pay IRS some amount. So, I thought of getting a second opinion from H&R Block as they advertise "free consulting". I went to the office and the tax specialist started handing over a couple of documents to me for signing. I was apprehensive and tried to question her intent. She responded that I need to sign them, that I am allowing H&R Block access to my personal data and that they will not disclose it to third party. So, I went ahead and signed them. Later she started filling the details into their computer system and handed me a couple of more documents for signing. Now I got suspicious and told her that I was there for consultation. She said she has started preparing my tax filing and I cannot "go back". This was pathetic. Their quote of "Do not pay until you are satisfied,” did not hold true. Moreover, the tax I owed to IRS was not lowered even by a penny. I owed the same amount to IRS as was showing on Turbo Tax. I ended up paying $43 for something that would have cost me $25 on Turbo tax. I am highly dissatisfied with the way they kind of forced me to file the taxes then and there. I advise you avoid H&R as much as possible. There are many other far better tax consultants who can save us the same or more money, not being overly expensive.
I went to H&R Block for the first time ever this year to have my taxes prepared, and I was appalled. Not only did they charge me $450 to do my taxes, but then I corrected my "tax professional" twice and still have to wait two weeks for my return! This is the most outrageous price I have ever been charged for such a simple service. I called ahead of time when I made the appointment to ask about the fees, and I was quoted $119 plus $39 for state filing and $4 fee for something else. I have always gone to Jackson Hewitt, and this is what I get for trying someone new! As a single mom of two, there are plenty of other things that I could have done with $450 rather than handing it to someone for crunching a few numbers. To make matters worse, I had already started my federal return online so all of my information was already in their system and all this lady had to do was hit enter! I feel scammed and stupid for trusting them. My best bet to anyone who wants their taxes done, go anywhere but H&R Block!
I went in and was told my return would be free. I sat down with one person who was unable to figure out how to complete my forms due to my educational status. I was referred to another employee who had been there longer. She sat down with me, wasted my time going through everything because then she told me the final fees would be $278 because I was filing one child and a 1098-T. Both people were pleasant but the fees were a shock. I refused to sign the final signature page and left. I went home and completed my taxes on TurboTax free.
I recently moved to Massachusetts from a different state and was confused on how to file my taxes. I went to H&R Block in Franklin, MA. The "tax specialist" was also confused on how to file my taxes and had to ask a couple different colleagues for help. My mind was never put at ease during the whole process as I feel I wasn't really described the filing process. In previous years, I filed my taxes online and it was relatively easy. The in-office process took about an hour today only to find out I was being charged $318.00 at the end. My return was only $400. I was so furious because they really caught me off guard with their rates! Thanks for the $79 tax refund coming my way! I would never recommend anyone go H&R Block! There are far easier and smarter avenues to follow!
I filed my taxes for several years with H&R Block. I have never been treated like I was this year at this different place I tried (Muldoon by Carrs in Anchorage). I filed on the 20th of January. My husband is in military and our W2s came in early. They said they were understaffed because they didn’t expect the military's W2s to come out early. However, I made an appointment at 2 pm (everyone was still at work) so it wasn’t busy yet. I brought my kids with me, because my husband is deployed and I am the only one to watch my kids. Usually my taxes take an hour tops one W2/don't own anything. It’s pretty simple, right? I was in the office for 3 hours, even with an appointment! I felt like I was doing my own taxes and they had the nerve to charge me a full amount. My kids were tired and had a fit and it was extremely uncomfortable. Over a week later I got a call from them saying that the paperwork hasn't been filed yet, because they didn't process it right and I had more paperwork to sign. They remembered me as the lady with two kids who had a bad time and stressed everyone out. On the phone she suggested it would be fast and I could just leave my kids in the car if I wanted to! I live in Alaska. It’s 20 below in the winter and I have an autistic son and my daughter is 18 months. Not to mention, I would never want to leave my kids in the car. I’m so angry with the way my family was treated and the poor work ethic, time management, and how incompetent and unprepared H&R Block on Muldoon was. So, it’s not worth $350.00 or the time wasted. Not to mention, we are getting our refund later now.
I filed my taxes on January 17. I paid $315 just to have them done. Three weeks later, no check. I call to ask questions and they tell me there's nothing they can do. So I paid all that money to wait a month to receive my money. Note, the lady who did my taxes put papers in front of me said I had to sign them to get my taxes done. I have my grandmother go over the papers and it says that I signed a paper that gives permission to share my information but it was not mandatory to sign it but the lady said it was.
I filed mine on January 4 ,2012, and they told me that I would get a refund on January 25, 2012. After a week passed, they called me on January 17, 2012, that I have to come in and resign my paperwork and then I would get my refund on February 1, 2012, now I'm still waiting?
I had sign some paper when I first did my taxes on Jan 4, 2012 that I would get my refund on the Jan 25 and then a week later, they call me that I had to come in again to sign my paper work again and they said that I get my refund Feb. 1. I'm still waiting.
I've been going to H&R Block for some time now. The last two years has been awful! But the office here in Kansas city, Missouri, independents is full of incompetent people who seem unable to file anything. I've asked for help because the IRS denied my form, and received little to none help. I also paid for the "peace of mind" which is a total **, at least from this office. They kept telling me to call or for me to find out why! Is that not their job to do so? I'm not going. back there ever again and I'm making sure to tell my family and friends not to go there! What a waste of time and of business!
I feel the same as all the others on this page. I have been a long time customer of H&R block. First of all, every year, the price for them to do your taxes has gone up. 2nd I filed on the 16th, I was told my return would be on my Emerald card by the 25th no later. Coming on the 26th, no money was on the card. I call and I am told of this crash and it would be delayed until 1st. Then on the 27th, I am sent an empty email saying return status so I call office to check and I am told the 7th! Really?! I call the 800 number and ask for a supervisor and the person transferring me to him laughs, then I am told the 1st. I want to know the truth. I paid $263 for these unprofessional to file my taxes and I am been given the run around about my money. If you’re not sure, say that!
I filed e-file at home with H&R block, and when my return didn't come when it was estimated to, I called to see what was what. I talked to at least 12 people, and every one told me something different and when I asked to file a complaint, I was told I could not and that there was no one to complain to. And then I was put in contact with a "subject matter expert" who was rude and condescending and told me if I don't like it, I take my business elsewhere.
I had my taxes done by H&R Block. My co-worker reviewed my form and asked me how much they charged me. I did not know, because my English is limited and the person who did my file did not explain nor informed me about it. My co-worker was so upset and he asked me to drive back to the place and speak with them. The person who did my file kept telling us that the reason they charged us is because she gave us a "bigger" return. The total time spent in preparing the taxes was about fifteen minutes and the charge was $453.00 for federal return. I had two w-2, make five thousand for my side job, and I have one dependent.
I was charged $367.00 and I was told I was paying for a fast return 7-8 days. Now, we are gong on 11 days and when I asked what did I pay for because I know people that only had to pay $255, they then said I was charged per form.
I went to file my taxes and not only was I charged $337.00, but the preparer did not even speak english. I had to repeat my answers to her questions numerous times and check the information that she was submitting because she did not know how to type as well. I work in CT and live in NY. She kept telling me throughout the process that she has never done a NYS return. Could you imagine how nervous that makes me feel when the person I am paying to do my taxes from a legitimate business is telling me that she does not understand NY taxes? On top of it all, she used my automatic signature in the system and signed numerous forms that I did not get to review. I did my taxes with this company last year and never had a problem but this year will be that last time I use H&R block. It's a scam! I was told by the preparer that I should activate my Emerald card within 24 hours of receiving it. I tried to activate it two days later and I was not registered to the card. So then, I checked my E-file status online and again it was not recognized. I then called the preparer and she did not understand what I was saying so she transferred me to another tax preparer who explained that they were not able to submit it last night because they went home at 9:30pm, so they should have taken care of it this morning. When I called customer service, they tell me that they will call me back and that this happens sometimes because they are so busy in the office. I received a phone call twenty minutes later from the original tax preparer explaining that she submitted it today. When I asked her when, she continued with an attitude and said "today." I then continued to explain that it takes two hours for me to view so I would like to know around what time. She then said, "this afternoon." I said, great then I will check in a moment and she continued to explain that she would complete it in a few minutes. She asked me for my email and home address after I had given that to her when I filed my return. I am in the hospitality industry for over twelve years and know a thing or two about service and working with people. This company not only lacks customer service but lacks tax experience. I believe that maybe they hire people who are just looking for extra cash during the tax season. The receptionist was rude and ignored everyone that came into the office as well as complained that she had not been able to punch in because a customer needed assistance. The presentation, atmosphere, and overall experience is one that I refuse to encounter again.
H&R Block charged me $320.50 to prepare my taxes. It has been almost 3 weeks and I still have not received my tax return. When I call the office, the receptionist is short with me and rude. I called the district manager and was told it could be up to another week before I receive my return and the rude receptionist will call me when it is in. I will never file my taxes with H&R Block again!
I will never file my taxes again with H&R Block. They said they charged $119 to $280 just to claim my son on the taxes. I could deal with $119 but just to add a few more numbers and a name they charged me $260 more and on top of that they are going to charge me because I didn't want their Emerald card. They are crooks. Because of certain things going on, I had no choice but file with them, but next year I know better I will just go to Jackson Hewitt or something.
I used H&R Block last year and they made it easy and quick. I filed on the 17th of January and took the Emerald Card option, so that I would have my refund on the 25th. My husband and I file separate states so we were told if we didn't hear back in three days, to call. Well, we waited and never heard so we called and were told they didn't know how long it would be. So we waited another few days, until the 25th when our taxes did not appear on the card. We called again. Same answer about state taxes and they told us our federals were delayed until the 1st due to a server crash. Well, now they're telling me the 7th and still no word on the states. If I pay well over $200 for something, I expect to get my money's worth in return!
I cannot understand why 2 people on social security with a few 401k statements had to pay well over $300.00 for tax return. Why not only that when I called to make an appointment, they scheduled me with a well over 80 yr old man that you could hardly hear or understand. Before we left, we let him know we will not be back. My wife’s late husband was an OTR truck driver that needed a lot of extra filing and he never paid what we paid today. We will not go back and hope to tell you if anyone inquire about going to H&R Block, we will let them know.
People: H&R Block is not the same as it was years ago! They no longer give you the money early. They have to wait till IRS pays them and they pay you! They have raised their prices over the years. It is no longer reasonable to go to them for simple forms or if you only have dependents! I paid $315 for them to do 1040 with 3 dependents which anyone could have done themselves. Every city or community has help for those who cannot. This year it is taking way longer due to IRS changes--about 2-3 weeks efile on Emerald Card! I’m currently on my 16th day before the weekend—now IRS says February 3rd! I filed at H&R Block on Jan. 13th! H&R Block will not disclose this with you so be prepared to wait longer than normal! $315 for less than an hour’s time is ridiculous and you’re not receiving the money any earlier than if you efile yourself! Turbo Tax is the way to go. Notice how H&R Block now have the home edition because they know their offices will be closing! Do not use H&R Block. I’m a customer for many years and I’m fed up! Too expensive for nothing!
On January 16th I went into the office to file my taxes. They told me their systems were down but if they came back up by 5 pm they would get my taxes entered and I'd have my money by midnight that night. I left the office and got about 3 miles down the road and they called and said the systems were back up and I could come back. I went back in and filed my taxes and after I'm signing the last page they tell me I will have my return on the 25th. Herein starts the first of many lies I have been told by the staff of this office. I was charged $196 to file my taxes for what they said on the 16th was a rapid refund. On the 25th I still don't have my money so I call the office. They inform me the 25th isn't over yet to keep checking back that I would have my money within 24 hours at the latest. On the 26th I still don't have my money and have filed a complaint with their 800 number. I go into the office after several phones with still the same excuses instead of honest answers. The man that was over the office was incredibly rude to me and told me to shut up. I ask him if he didn't realize I was a customer that he was dealing with. He told me that after I left that office that day I would never be his customer again and that he didn't want me to set foot in the Vernon H&R Block again. He gave me a check for $100 and told me he was giving me this as long as I agreed never to call their complaint department again. I don't take to kindly to threats or bribes and the reason the have an 800 number is so the people over H&R Block knows how their customers are being treated. I will agree with him that once I do get my tax return I will never make the mistake of using H&R Block again! I'm not saying that all their offices are run as poorly as this one but this has truly been the worst experience in customer service I've ever received. My advise to anyone living in or around Lamar County, Alabama is never make the mistake I did by letting the office at 125 1st Ave NW Vernon, Al 35592 file your taxes!
Stay away from H&R block. The fee was $260, and I still have to wait two weeks. I've had them prepare my taxes for over 15 years, and have never had to wait that long. You would come out better, by trying to Efile or Jackson Hewitt. Please don't set yourself up like I did.
I prepared my taxes with H&R Block online and I decided to let them take their fee out of my refund. They had a disclaimer stating that if I owe the bank any money it would be deducted from my refund and to call the bank and check if any money is owed. I called the bank and was told I didn't owe the bank anything, but this morning my refund is $600 short. The bank now says I owe them for a loan from four years ago. I do not own this debt and have no knowledge of it.
You advertise on TV taxes done for free. I went to the Stillwater Ok office. They charged me 264 to do my taxes. This is such a rip off. My taxes were not that difficult; I was expecting to pay something but not this much. I will never go back to a H&R Block again and I will tell everyone I meet what a rip off your company is!
I was promised my refund on the 25th of Jan and now they tell me it will be the 31st.They lie to you and mislead you and you pay all this money. I will never use them again and I will make sure I tell everyone I come in contact with how H&R Block did me on my refund. They will lose a lot of customers because of this issue. People need their money. That's why you file and pay the money.
I gave her social security cards and she still entered them wrong and my tax return had to be re-sent. Next year, I will be going to Jackson Hewitt. If she would have concentrated instead of trying to talk, it would have been done correctly. I come here for preciseness that H&R Block displays.
The same thing is happening to me with my 2012 tax refund as the lady below! I am furious! I was not told that the IRS did not accept refunds until the 17th and was told it would be on my Emerald card no later than the 25th. I have called the IRS, H&R Block card, and finally the H&R branch I used everyday! They have no straight answer, but yes, more than one! I am now told I have to wait until the 31st and still must pay the $200 for filing even if I don't get my refund when I was assured on a special date. I am ** beyond belief. I bought a truck because I was assured to receive my money by then. After not getting a single response the same, I called an H&R Block in a different city. They told me what was going on but I feel robbed! I hate your company and plan to steer clear of your thieving ways. On a side note, it would be nice to speak with someone that I can understand!
I am so frustrated with H&R Block. They told me and my family that we would get our return on Jan 25. Well now their saying Jan 31. I paid them $269.00 to get my taxes done there. They don’t care, I’m sure they’ve been paid already. I just can’t believe this especially since I was counting on the money on Jan 25.
I am very upset and unsatisfied with the level of professionalism that I witnessed at the H&R Block on Green Valley Ranch Blvd in Denver, Co. My experience there was horrible. Your staff there are not approachable and non customer friendly and it was very obvious that they did not want our business! I felt discriminated because of my race and my language. I feel it's important for me to inform you of my dissatisfaction with their service so you can address it with your staff accordingly!
I had my taxes done at the Hernando, MS office. Now I am having issues and there is no help online or at the office. I feel that they are giving me the run around. The IRS is holding my money and I can’t get any help from the office at which I filed at. I paid them more than four hundred dollars. Now they are not willing to take the time to help me. I had to call a 1800 number to get another 1800 number for the IRS for the same info that I got online.
After using H & R Block for years, they sent the tax program in the mail for the next year's use at which time you load the program into your computer for use, they don't tell you that the program until after several try's that you have to call to get it. In the mean time, it has charged you for each try to load it and you get billed through your back account. So a chose program that cost $44.95 now has cost you $150.35 and getting your refund, well you're own your own. Good luck. It's been a week so far with no results. Where's my money, you got yours!
I am disappointed with the people complaining about H&R Block here. The lady who walks in waits a while, then fails to produce a coupon until the end of the process. She was being a bad consumer--a shady consumer, in fact. I am complaining about her and everyone like her. She should have walked in, produced the coupon and negotiated a rate before getting started. H&R Block did nothing wrong. A decade ago they did, and they went to court for racketeering. Not so much now. On the Web page, you are one click from finding the state price. It says free. You can't be above driving age without knowing means that you better read about the catch. Sure enough, click Federal filing is free, but State is not. You have to look at a whopping 2 inches of text to see the words State additional fee. There are many options, I did them in high school. You walk to the library and get free tax forms. Or go to IRS.gov, get your free tax forms, prepare them yourself. You are not entitled to free software made by a corporation. You are not entitled to a free professional tax person's time in their own office. I will bet you that the coupon received in the story here said *State filing extra. I bet it also said, "must be presented before consultation." You couldn't be troubled to spend 10-20 seconds reading. This site is here to help people with real consumer fraud issues. I am appalled to see people coming in and complaining about problems with themselves. It is just lazy greed. Do you understand that you don't just have to read the fine print in other countries? You have to bribe people to take your taxes. You have to make sure you did it right many times so you don't get hit by the ** of a rifle. Seriously, grow up. You, guys, are abusing the power you wield as an American.
I need my w-2 record from 2010 tax year I did with H & R block on line. I need to see name and addresses street. Number input on my forms. I can not get on line of at local office.
Well my boyfriend and I have been really strapped for cash. We each received a coupon in the mail for H&R Block, if you have a 1040ez you get it for free. So I called the 800 #, talked to the lady and made sure that since he has a 401 retirement plan and the amount is on w-2 that was she sure that it was free. The woman assured me that it would be and made us an appointment. So we get to our appointment at 3:50 and we sat like idiots till oh about 4:35 pm. Mind you, there was just us and the woman that was supposed to do our taxes had someone in her office. There were two others there also. Well, the head lady finally decided to start it for my boyfriend." I believe that if your company is running a promotion that the first thing out of her mouth should of been did you receive a coupon in the mail? Well, she never said a thing about it and my boyfriend is not a people person so he didn't mention it. Well, it took about six or 7 minutes for them to prepare it and she says that will be 103.00. He told her, well I'm not signing anything and he handed her the coupon she said it was too late. Well, I go in and asked her for the w-2 back. She said she can't give it to me that will be 35.00 dollars if I want it back for their time. Well, what about our time? We sat there almost 45 minutes to even see someone. Poor business tactics if you ask me not one word about the coupon. So went to go print another one out and it's gonna be a while till we get a new one. So to top it off, I told her, look we are struggling right now and this is a small town and we both had our taxes done there before for a couple of years, although we go smart after how much money they charged and see how that remodeled their office. She said to me, oh everybody is broke right now. Well, she has a job and another business. She ain't hurting by no means. Well, I'm in wrong business if they're getting 35.00 for six minutes of their time. Well, she was rude and very nasty. I want the w-2 back now.
I had my taxes prepared at Northtown Mall in Minnesota on 1/19/12 by Marilyn ** who did a good job. When I found out what the fee was, I could not believe it. They charged $323.50. for a service that a CPA from last year charged $240 which I thought was a lot. My taxes were not that complicated. I am 62 years old and cannot afford it. I had to use my Visa to pay for it. And now, I start making payments on that. The fee was 1/3 of the refund. Is there anything the company do to help me?
The software seems to be the same type wizard this year and every state site is advertising them as having "free state e-file". Well it "used to be free", it isn’t any longer. In fact, it is $34.95 for each state return and they give you up to 3 state returns to file. I originally started out with the free version. Some student loan interest took me into the $14.95 range. And if I choose to deduct the fees out of my check, they will also take $32.95 from my check. Where the heck is anything free? So much for H&R Block, think I will come out better buying TurboTax this year.
They claim on TV that if you are a poor person, they will do your simple tax return for free. But when I tried to file, they ask for a cell phone number, which I do not have as I can not afford it. When I called to complain, they just said sorry.
I have used H and R block online for my taxes for several years now. I had spent over 6 months entering my 2010 tax information online but had had some personal problems so I had not finished my return for 2010. On Jan 1, 2012 H and R Block online software deleted all my data. Now, I have to enter it in again - I have been on the phone with them for over 2 hours and other than trying to get more money from me they were of no help. In fact, they told me they could see my file but then said they hadn't really seen it. Unbelievable!
I would advise people to stay away from the Christmas cash. If you get approved, the interest is ridiculous if you don’t pay it back in time.
H&R Block in Pikeville, KY knowingly hires crook preparers who let people claim anything they want, even pulling numbers out of the air. I saw one they called "Pat" helping someone make up numbers for their business without receipts. Another preparer "Angie" told this guy he did not need to file his 1099M. Something needs to be done to keep H&R Block from hiring these people.
H&R Block at Wal-Mart location, Colonial Blvd, Orlando Florida, prepared my 2010 tax return and I'm yet awaiting my return. I attempted to make contact with H&R Block with no success. Wal-Mart stated they are not responsible since they only rented out space.
I was not charged anything but went to, as I have for several years, apply for the emerald advance. I was denied because "no relevant relationship with H&R Block". Having them do my taxes every year for 20 years to the tune of $400 a pop is evidently irrelevant. Having my payroll direct deposited to their bank that charges outlandish fees every time I touch the card is apparently irrelevant as well. My guess is no H&R block customers is relevant but I assure you, your money is.
I am a returning veteran. On October 20, 2011, I had my taxes prepared by H&R Block and believed they were to be e-filed. I left the office, believing I would receive my refund by November 20. After using the "where's my refund" function on the IRS and calling them to check on the status of my refund, I discovered that my return was not submitted. Long story short, after many calls, and finding someone in their office accidentally, I found out that e-file is not an option after Oct 15. Did a formal claim with H&R block and they had till November 29 to respond. Their solution is we won't charge you to prepare your taxes since we will have to redo them for you to mail them in. The fact is that the preparer’s incompetence resulted in me not having my refund and being subjected to any penalties is bad enough. But the fact is that I have not even received a formal sincere apology or respectable resolution is even more insulting. I am now unemployed. I am a fulltime student and I was to receive $4000. I needed that money and I did everything I was supposed to upon my return home.
Response to Most Postings Below: 1. You are responsible for providing ALL "source" documents to the Tax Preparer. Peace of Mind (note correct spelling) does not cover clients who don't provide all documentation to the Tax Preparer and then get a letter from the IRS because of documents left off the return. 2. The IRS has a copy of every source document you receive (Form W-2, Form 1099, Unemployment, etc.). Therefore, if you don't provide a document to your Tax Preparer, it will most likely get caught by the IRS. 3. Manufacturing 'dependents' so you can claim more tax credits is illegal and can prevent you from receiving tax credits like EITC for 10 years even if you otherwise qualify. Therefore, it is best not to lie to your Tax Preparer and only claim true dependents. 4. The price of a return is based on forms used. The more dependents, income forms and credits claimed, the more the cost of the return. 5. Refund loans do charge high interest rates. Unless you absolutely had to have it, wait 14 days and don't pay the fees. You can't possibly leave the office and not see the fees - it's in the paperwork you are given. It gets really, really annoying to read people's comments who get all kinds of tax credits (ie - EITC aka tax welfare) taken from hard-working people that get phased out of such credits and then listen to gripe and complain about the cost of the return and time you have to wait to get it. You should just be thankful that it's available to you in the first place.
We have a small business. I brought our papers in to be filed to H&R block and dropped them off. I told the woman at the desk that I did not have all the invoices, but she could go through the bank statements and find everything she needed to complete the taxes. No problem. However, a few weeks later after all was said and done, we needed to get a new truck and went to our bank, who we give copies of our taxes to and they said we did not make enough to be eligible for a loan. We looked at the taxes and realized that they (H&R Block) had only gone with the invoices I gave them and had not looked through the bank statements to complete our taxes properly. So we went back to H&R Block and had the lady do them over and now we owe them money. That is fine, except now we will have a penalty for being late and we have had to amend the taxes, so it looks bad. Not to mention, it also affects the child tax I receive. We asked that they (H&R Block) pay the interest, but the woman said no, she had done enough by helping us again.
In Feb. 2011, I went to H&R Block in Lehigh Acres, Florida to file my tax return. At that time, I was advised by a prep agent to obtain my husband's death certificate and file a joint return to take advantage of the "death benefit" (my husband passed away on June 15, 2010. He had not worked at all in 2010, so he had no income to file). I did just that. I received his death certificate and went back to the H&R Block on Feb. 23 to file. H&R fees of $256.00 and bank fees of $32.05 were deducted from my federal return of $3937.00, leaving $3648.05 to be direct deposited into my bank account in 8-15 days. I also had state of Iowa return of $315.00. On 3/04/11, I received a statement from Child Support Recovery, stating my refund was intercepted for back support owed by my husband. They had taken $3884.00. I went online to H&R Block to check my refund status. Their site told me that there was a delay in processing my refund. I called the IRS and H&R Block to find out what had happened. I was told I needed to file an injured spouse form to get this reversed. I did just that on 3/14/11 and paid another $31.00. I also sent copies of all tax info to Iowa IRS, so they had proof that I was the only one in my household that had worked in 2010. Still, nothing was reversed. At this point I'm baffled. I had done all that I was told to do and still nothing happened. Meanwhile, I called Iowa to find out why I had not received the $314.00 from there. I was told that 171.00 was deposited into my account on 4/12/11. I called my bank and nothing happened. On 5/20/2011, I spoke with Iowa Dept. of Revenue. After verification of my bank account #, I was told, "No, it went into a different acct." I called the H&R Block 800 #. I was told it was probably applied to the preparation fees. I didn't understand how they couldn't know where my money had gone! I had received notices from the IRS that I was entitled to $248.00. Then one said $53.00 had gone into my acct. Once again, I contacted my bank and nothing happened. I called H&R Block and again heard the same thing. It was probably held. After weeks of checking back with the IRS, I finally explained to the rep on the phone what had happened and what I had done to resolve the problem. She then put me through to the person that handled the "injured spouse forms". At that time, I was told "the form was filled out incorrectly". The agent at H&R Block had my husband as the injured spouse. I called H&R Block where I filed. And the rep looked it up and verified in fact it was. I went back to H&R on 6/01/11 and the agent refiled the form for me. The agent told me that the person that filed my taxes, to begin with, put my husband as the primary tax payer and me as secondary with $0.00 income. Wow...I was floored. So, when the first injured spouse form was filed, it was entered just as the tax return was husband first and myself second. I showed her the guarantee they offered. And I told her I should get my filing fees refunded at the very least. She got her manager. He said no it wasn't their fault, it's just the injured spouse form was wrong. But he gave me $31.00 and told me he had not been paid for the fees I owed . I called Iowa and talked to the same person that confirmed that the 171.00 and the 53.00 went into H&R Block's account. The local manager argued with me saying "no, it did not". When I left, he was still on the phone with whoever handles the deposits and such (I am shortening this mess). I took the form to the post office and mailed it myself on 6/01/11. And I continued to wait. I was checking with the IRS about every 2-3 weeks. They were processing the form. I was then waiting for a date for it to go out. Last week of July, I called and was told my refund would go out on the 19th of August. I called on the 19th and was told it had been processed, but had no date yet for mailing. After being more than patient, I have had it. This entire mess is H&R Block's fault. And I feel I should have been refunded my fees plus interest. At least after having to wait for over 6 months, I have been advised to seek an attorney .
I filed my taxes for the first time in 2010. I went to H&R Block because it was the only place I knew who do tax returns. I had moved from Clearwater, British Columbia to Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta and heard I could claim my moving expenses. I saved all my receipts from the move. When it came the time to file my taxes, me and the employee filled out all the information and she told me I could get more on my return if I claim my kilometers instead of using my receipts. I thought this was a good idea. I do not know the exact mileage from Clearwater BC to Fort Saskatchewan AB. She used Google maps to find the mileage and was struggling with the site. When she finally figured out how to work Google earth, she made an error by typing in Clearwater, Florida instead of Clearwater BC; which Florida is approximately 6,000 kilometers further than Clearwater BC. She never confirmed her findings with me. I got audited this year and now they were saying that I owe 2,000 dollars back because of their mistake.
Ok, I'll try and keep this simple and clear I'm so furious right now so I'll try and keep the emotion under control. I'm a New Zealander living in the United States on a G4 visa (diplomatic visa). I am classified as my wife's dependent and work full-time for a non-profit. I had been faithfully filing my taxes since 2007 using Turbo Tax. When I found out in 2010 that I had been filing incorrectly, I went to an H&R Block Premium office and that's where my problems really started! I paid about $800 to refile my taxes for 2007, 2008, and 2009. I paid another $200 earlier in 2011 to file my 2010 taxes. The H&R Block Premium tax specialist had told me that he was very familiar with this kind of filing and that as a non-resident alien; I was not eligible to pay deductions for FICA and Medicare. This was good news as I had been paying these taxes for 2007, 2008, and 2009 and I was looking forward to a massive refund. He also told me to ask my employer to refund FICA and Medicare for all of 2010 and to tell them not to deduct those taxes for 2011, which I stupidly did (who would have thought the tax specialist was wrong, right? I mean after all, it is their job to get this right!). Well last week, my employer told me that they had retained legal advice and been advised that I was NOT eligible to withhold FICA and Medicare and owed over $7,500 in back taxes. I quickly reached out to the H&R Block Premium tax specialist who sent me an email saying, "It seems I was using outdated regulations". Now he's telling me that although he made a mistake and admits it was his, and therefore H&R Block's fault, there is nothing he can do to help. So I'm left holding the bag because I chose to pay these guys $1,000 to give me false and misleading tax information which set me up to paying heavy duty back taxes, penalties, and interest. I feel like my life is over and I don't know what to do. I don't have this kind of money.
I used this card to make a purchase and after I got a refund for the item and the merchant released the incompetent morons at "customer service" refuse to give me my damn money back! I have told them that the money has not been released (an out and out lie) and that there is nothing they can do (another out and out lie) and that they will sit around and drink and get high for a damn week before they will get off of their incompetent asses and give me my money. I want to let people know that if you have one of these cards, cut it up before they steal your money too! If an attorney can contact me to start a class action lawsuit against this company I would like it please.
I went to H&R Block to apply for the emerald advance line of credit that we have been using every year for quite some time. I asked the tax preparer if we were still eligible for the line of credit if we owed money to the IRS. I owed them 800 dollars from the previous year. I brought the statement in with me. I was told not to agree to the payment plan that the IRS will try to set up with me, because they want a huge payment up front. I was told they would just take it out of my taxes. Her calculations showed that my refund would be large enough to pay back both the money owed to the IRS, the emerald advance loan, and still receive a tax refund. When we went in to have our taxes prepared in February, we were given some shocking news. I was told by my tax preparer that I never should have been given that loan. I now have a 900 dollar debt with this bank. The interest on this loan is outrageous. No one ever intends to have to make payments on it, because the tax preparers don't give them the loan unless they will definitely have the money when their tax refund comes in.
I was told on July 1, 2011 that I need not get a new Bankcard. I could just change my pin number after I told the customer service lady that someone had stolen my card. It was my son, but I got it back minus $262.95. So, I called on July 29th 2011, and was told that my old card was cancelled, but couldn’t understand why a new Bankcard was never put in their system to be mailed to me. She ordered me a new card, and apologized for me being told the wrong information. Saying sorry does not help my situation at all, and I was told a letter was sent to me on July 18th 2011, stating what is going on in the fraud case. Again, I have not received such a letter, and I know H&R Block has my correct address because I received an affidavit in the mail at the same mailbox address. My name is Phyliciah *, phone number is number is *. My email address is *@gmail.com.
I got a christmas loan in December that was supposed to be paid out of my return. It was paid no problem. Well, in May, I had called to get my balance and an automated message said would I like to move 300 from my advance account to my personal account. I thought this was money I forgot about when I did my taxes and got my return so I said yes. Well, two months later I get a text with my balance and its 300 short. When I went online to check my statement, it was conveniently for them unavailable. So I called to inquire why the 300 was missing. Come to find out the 300 was an "extension" of my christmas loan and because I didn't make any payments they closed my advance account and took the money out of my personal account. I told them that I was unaware of any "extension" as they call it of my christmas loan, and they said when I signed the paperwork in december the new "extension" option was made aware to me. I told them no. I wasn't made aware of that and how could they just manipulate me like that. They told me if I wanted to dispute it, I had to write to a PO Box for the bank. I got a bill AFTER they took that 300 and it was asking for a payment on the 300 "extension" so I feel as though I was misled about this whole thing. I agree I owe the 300 but they could have given me the terms and conditions of this so-called extension so I could make an informed decision as a consumer. Also, they could have provided that transfer of funds on my statement online instead of making them conveniently unavailable.
I sent Gracy all my 2005 Tax receipts and records so that she could file. she would not return phone calls finaly she said "my desk is so messy that I hope I can find your paper work" Now in 2011 she says that her car was stolen several years ago and that she is sorry. I have emails back and forth from her admitting all fo this.
HR block filed my taxes in 2009 and about a month ago I received a bill from the IRS for $3700! I called them and set up an appointment with the manager of HR block. She went over it and found that it was the preparer's fault. I received an annuity that year and she should've indicated I paid 3000 in taxes on it. But instead, she put a zero, like I did not pay taxes on that annuity. So I figured they would stand behind their mistake. No, she proceeded to point out that I did not purchase the 30 dollar peace of mind protection plan. I asked what protection plan? I was never asked to purchase it. But I signed the waiver. A lot of people are tax dumb that is why we go to tax professionals to do our taxes. And they do them wrong and we have to pay--hard-working, middle-class American veterans like me! Please help.
After it was said and done, they got me for an extra 99 dollars. Here's how. We took a second look and you qualify for a credit for another 400 dollars. It is 99 dollars. I know I'm getting ** but whatever. It's 301 dollars more. So, I went and picked up the envelope. They won't even file it for me. I give them 99 dollars. I said, “How long will this take?” They said 15 business days. I waited like 30 and finally looked it up online. It is 8-12 weeks. Also, there is obvious incentive to overlook something, so you take a second look and skim some poor person with an already low-income out of nearly 1/4 of their tax return. I'm getting Turbo Tax next year. They are cheats.
I used their online tax prep software to file a return. The IRS modified the return reducing my refund by more than $7,500. This was a huge miss on the part of H&R Block.
They mislaid my Peace of Mind claim for $500. When I went back to check on it, they said it was past the 60 days for filing, and therefore I was not able to get it. They are a rip off. When I spoke to the Office Manager, she was extremely belligerent about the matter. When I asked to speak to another person she said "I'm the Office Manager! " In my work, had I spoken to a customer the way they spoke to me, I would be fired on the spot. Then I found out that the $500 a year I'd been paying them is way over priced. I have a simple return.
On April 15, 2011 at approximately 9:30 AM, I was assaulted by an H&R Block manager named Gary. I caught them cheating on their fees (double billing) and filed a complaint. The manager lowered the fee from $800 to $660, still almost $200 more than I paid last year. When I went to get my paperwork, the manager took me in the back and shoved a sheet in front of me and said, "Sign here. " I said "No, I want to look at the papers first. $660 is too much. "He thought I was trying to steal his paperwork, so he (6 ft., heavyset) grabbed me from behind and squeezed me as hard as he could and pushed me into a corner and squeezed until I dropped the papers. I was screaming Help! Help! but no one came to help. When he finally got the paperwork, the manager yelled, "Call the police! This is attempted theft! " I too, called the police to report an assault. When the police came, all the H&R Block employees lied and said that nothing had happened, that I was very problematic and had already been. (Yes, I was because I had filed a complaint). The police believed them. I was alone. I told the police that I'm a 60 year old university professor and had no motive to steal papers, I just wanted my W2, 1099s, etc. back. The customers sitting up front heard me screaming but did nothing and the police refused to interview them. I did get my paperwork back and the police told me to get out. It was a civil case, they said. There were no cameras, so I have no assault case. When the police left, one of the women who worked there threatened me, saying, "We know where you live and your telephone number." I was assaulted by an employee or maybe franchise owner and I was humiliated by the New York City police. I would like for the press to pick up this story.
In January 2011, my husband and I received a letter from the IRS, notifying us that we owed them $1,400 and some change for failing to report wages. My husband and I have filed our taxes with H&R Block for at least four years in a row. I purchased the Peace of Mind insurance, to insure that if any mistakes were committed by H&R Block would be covered. Being that my husband is in the military and he had been deployed for that tax year, I really wanted to have that reassurance. I immediately contact the local office where I live, I was immediately accused that we had failed to include a W2, because they hadn't stapled the W2 to the folder like the others. H&R Block declined my claim after 4 weeks. During the waiting time, I was never contacted by anyone at H&R Block. According to the representative that represented me during the claim process, there is nothing that I can do because my husband and I signed a form that lists the W2 what were turning in during the tax preparation, which pretty much releases H&R Block from liability of making any mistakes. So in other words, H&R Block is selling a product that takes consumers money and leave them with these IRS charges and fees. I am frustrated and desperately searching for current lawsuits against H&R Block. I found a Forum on www.Topics.com. I found other consumers like myself and my husband with similar issues with H&R Block. I am seeking your help to get to the bottom of this. Is H&R Block really selling Peace of Mind or is it a big scam? Please help us.
My wife and I obtained the Emerald Card line of credit loan from H&R Block Bank in 12/4/10 for $1,000.00 each. They automatically charged $45.00 for their annual fee and we had the option to have January's payment automatically withdrawn by H&R Block Bank in the amount of $55.00. This left us with a loan for the amount of $900.00 each. We are both now receiving bills in the mail requesting the same $55.00 each to be paid along with their interest. I inquired many times about how I should pay the January payment twice and they can't seem to explain it. Their only response is that we still owe the $55.00 that they already took for the January payment. I asked them if this was a loophole for the bank to steal from the consumer and I was told that they didn't feel that way.
I called the NYC Service number 311 to get information on where to file my taxes for free or at a low cost. They mentioned two places including H&R Block that was offering the service for just $29 to those families with low income. I also checked the NYC.gov website to verify the information and there it was as well. On 03/22/2011, I went to an H&R Block location near my house, filed my taxes and they charged me $80.00. The H&R personal looked at me like I was a lying. Elien said they had never heard of such promotion and showed zero professionalism.
H&R Block prepared my 2010 taxes and since I was a first-time home buyer, I could not file until February 15 and I had to mail my tax forms in. When I picked my taxes up from H&R Block, they were already in a sealed envelope and I was told I just needed to mail it to the IRS which I did that very day. Here it is, March 17, 2011 and I received a letter from the IRS that they do not have all the proper information to process my taxes. They need a copy of the Settlement Statement in order to proceed with my refund process and after receiving the proper paperwork, it could be 6 to 8 more weeks before I could get my refund. After paying $274.00 to H&R Block, I would have thought that this would have been done in the first place. So when I called them to address the issue, they told me that this is a new requirement that the government just passed a week ago. I told the lady, Pat, whom I spoke with that I find this very hard to believe and I felt that they were just trying to cover their mistake because the government isn't going to change the guidelines right in the middle of tax season. Pat allowed that the government will do what they want when they want. H&R Block is supposed to be a professional tax preparer and after being lied to, I will never trust them to do my taxes again.
This is a simple letter complaining about H&R Block crazy fees. I just came back from one of their offices doing my taxes and I paid $500 to file my taxes. I have never paid such a crazy amount of money; they are ripping off their customers. This is my first and last time I file taxes with them and I will make sure nobody from my family or friends do taxes in these offices. I am going to find out how I can get my money back because 45 minutes of their time is not worth $500 of my pocket.
H&R Block prepared my 2009 taxes on February 10th 2010. On February 16th, I received a letter from the IRS asking me to check my 2010 copy of my 2010 tax form because the IRS had me down for making $21,184.00 more than I claimed. I pulled my copy and looked it over. I then called Ms. Terry ** who had prepared my taxes last year. I told her about the letter I had received and she asked me to drop it off at the H&R Block office so she could read it and review my file. She said that she would call me in a day or two. I waited three days and called her back to find out what was going on. She answered my call by asking if I received Social Security. I told her that she knew I did because I am on disability and I told her when she completed my taxes, plus had it written down at the top of all my itemized deductions that I had listed for my taxes and had included the form SSA-1099-Social Security Benefit Statement with all of my other receipts. She said that I didn't have the pink form and I told her that I did. She then said that it looks like I will have to pay $3629.00. I told her that it was unacceptable. I called the manager, Ms. Claudia ** later that afternoon and she asked me to let her review the letter and my file and she would call me in the morning. The next morning, she returned the call and then asked me to bring my copy of the taxes filed by them in 2010. I did take in my copy but did not let it out of my sight because I had proof of everything I said I had in this copy. It was clearly H&R Block's error! Ms. Claudia admitted this and said she didn't know why Terry did not include my Social Security in my income but this was their error and they would pay all penalties and interest. I asked her if she will take care of this issue and she answered me that they will pay the penalties and interest, and I will have to pay the $3505.00. I told her this is not fair since it was clearly their error. She said that she understood but that they would only pay the penalties and interest, and they would file my 2010 taxes for free this year. I told her that I was not satisfied and I would call her in a day or two. I already had an appointment to have Ms. Terry to prepare my taxes this year, but since this error, I decided that I would go back to my independent tax preparer that I had used previously to last years taxes. I thought I could save some money with H&R Block, which is the only reason I went to H&R Block to begin with. Well I saved $25.00 dollars on the filing fee with H&R Block to find out I now have to pay $3505.00 to the IRS. They have refused to pay for this error that they made. I am on disability d/t Parkinson's disease and this has had a very negative impact on my Parkinson's symptoms. I am on a fixed income having to pay for an error that a company made that brags on their website that they file one out of every seven people's taxes in the country. Something is very wrong with this picture. Their advertizing is very misleading saying that they "Stand by our work, and will pay any penalties and interest owed due to an H&R Block error." Every person I have talked to outside of H&R Block said they always thought that H&R Block would pay the entire bill if they made an error. I even contacted Support Services at H&R Block which was a waste of time. How can they continue to operate and do like this to people? They will never prepare my taxes again. I cancelled my appointment with Ms. Terry this year and told them that I was returning to my preparer I used before. They offered to pay this bill and I told Ms. Claudia that if she wanted to do something, she could pay the $3505 because they were the reason I had to do this to begin with. I told her I would never advise anyone to use H&R Block again and I would go to the News Stations on TV or whatever I had to do to inform people. She said she understood but still could not do any more. It is not right for them to be allowed to do business like this! I am going to have to pay $3505.00 and I am on a fixed income. I cannot afford this! Increased stress has occurred which exacerbates my Parkinson's symptoms.
I went to have my tax returns prepared at their Greenoaks location in Arlington, TX. I have been using H.R. Block over 12 years, prepared by the same person for 4 years. Regina Allen prepared them, she was on the phone with her brother who was in the hospital she said. While doing them, she inputted the same social security numbers of the kids that my ex-wife was caring. We have 4 kids and we carried 2 each. Because she wasn't paying attention. this problem occurred. I have paid for my peace of mind every since I've used them over 12 years. I have the copy of the forms sent in to the IRS, yet the copy they have is different now. The IRS has sent me several letters that I've taken to them, they told me to deal with Mr.Charles ** who dealt directly with the IRS. This problem is still going on until this date, however, they said the would file under the peace of mind insurance, yet nothing has been done. I have followed and completed every form or document requested of me.The manager of that location called me a stupid 'N' and that he no longer would be dealing with us. Charles ** is no longer employed with H.R. Block. I have filed several complaints at that location. They have sent me several letters of apology, yet nothing has been resolved. Please help me, the IRS has threatened to garnish my wages.
My wife and I filed our taxes as married joint. She currently owes back child support because her ex lied to the courts on a verbal agreement that they had in place. H&R Block filed our federal return as injured spouse to protect my return. However, they failed to notify me that California has no provision for an injured spouse and filed our state return. The state of California just took our entire tax return of $771 to pay that debt. As a result of that error, I lost my state income tax return and it essentially went to my wife's ex husband whom we are currently in court with over a custody dispute.
I filed taxes with them and the representative, Jonathan **, failed to file a work pay form for my husband's social security and the IRS rejected the taxes back. This resulted in me getting back less than I was told I would get back and also requiring me to come back to the office to complete more forms and all they could say was sorry. They were not willing to waive the $234.00 I paid to have the taxes done. When I asked for the district manager's name, Jeannie ** told me she could not give this information out. I had to do research on my own to find out it was Sonya ** . After speaking with her, she informed that she too was sorry and people make mistakes. They are professional tax preparers and should not make these kinds of mistakes and then sweep it under the rug as if nothing happened.
I just went through the process to file my federal taxes for 2010. At the very end of the process, I found out I could not print my federal tax forms without paying for my state forms first.
I got an emerald loan for $500 dollars and only used $400 then ending up paying them a $505 dollars and some cents this service is a scam. The government looks into everything why not H & R Block? Poor people don’t have a chance. They lie and have hidden fees, please help stop H & R Block from charging there hidden fees and 39% interest.
I filed my taxes through them and was told my return would be posted on the 11th because the IRS only posts twice a month and the 11th was the next posting. So I waited for 2 weeks until the 11th of Feb. but nothing posted. I called the IRS and checked their site, both indicated that the funds were deposited. At this point I called Emerald services to find out what the hold up was. One lady said the IRS didn't deposit the funds. Another stated that it was in process and would be posted by the 12th. I waited until the 12th and nothing appeared on my Emerald card, so I called back. I was told that they were still waiting for the IRS to process the payment. At this point I asked for a supervisor who asked what number I called for the IRS. I gave her the information and she said I needed to call a different number to find out what the hold up was on the IRS end. I called the number she gave me only to find out that it was a number for the Dept. of Treasury and they did not have my refund information. I called Emerald Card Services again, this time, I got a person who stated that they were just waiting to post the funds to the card, and that the IRS processed it. He told me to wait until the 15th for the funds to post. This makes three weeks that I did not have my money when all the time I could have Turbo Taxed this and had the funds on the 11th.
Every year, I pay more than $300.00 to have my taxes done. We are not rich, we make less than $5000.00 per year for a family of four. And every year, H&R Block promises to have my refund in my bank within 8 to 15 days. It never happens. It was always the bank's fault, according to H&R Block. So why am I paying this much money for them to guarantee it in my account in 8 to 15 days? I have been doing my taxes with them for over 30 years. I feel that they are lying to me or are omitting certain data every year, and I am finally tired of it. Hello, discount? Or else, please stop telling me one thing that never happens.
I went to H&R Block to file my tax return, which is very simple. I arrived and filled out the slip and sat down with the other people who were also waiting. Before I knew it, I was there for an hour and I was only staying there because of the free fed preparation fee. Otherwise I would have left. I overheard the lady at the front desk saying that appointments were taken before walk-ins,which is understandable, but no one should have to sit there for 2 1/2 hours like I did along with a few other people. That is no way to treat a customer. Appointment or not. They only had three preparers working with 30 people there. If that is the case then why didn't they have these giddy employees who were leaving for the day, stay after until the mass is serviced and get paid time and a half instead of calling other branches to see if there were any other preparers available to come and help. Another thing, the "free" tax preparation is misleading because of it only being federal. People could misinterpret that as being free altogether. The gentleman who helped me was prompt but seemed to complicate things by explaining what I already clearly knew. I ended up paying a state fee of $41 that I could've paid another place and been treated much better as a customer. This is the second time that I've been wronged by this company. I've never heard of anyone making things as complicated as H&R does. They normally charge ridiculous preparation fees and I went because I thought I was saving money but ended up paying the same as if I would've gone someplace else. I received no apology for my horrendous wait. I will never go to these people again.
I went to sit down and file my 2010 taxes on 01/17/2011, mind you, I have been through other problems with this company for the past two years. Jim was not a very educated tax filer He did not know if I should be able to claim my son or not. Then on 01/28/2011, my expected reception date, he then informed me for some unknown reason that all my taxes were eaten up by some sort of debt that I know I do not have. Do not go to him at all or H&R Block as they have ** me for the past 3 years starting with year 1, when their agent stole my refund along with other people's refund. Then Frank, last year, did not get me what I was entitled to. Now this year, again I got $0.00 refund for yet again no reason. Next year, I’ll go to Jackson Hewitt or anyone else. H&R Block is a scam and I would warn any young person not to deal with this company especially if you need or want your refund. And they had the guts to ask me to let them do an amendment. “Not on your life,” was my answer. I am facing homelessness bills not paid.
I went into H&R Block on January 3rd, 2011 to get my taxes done early because there was an advertisement in the window stating that they were giving you $1000 in advance if you let them prepare your taxes. Well, I asked if they were offering the advancement and I was told that they were. Once the tax preparer completed the forms, I was told the paper that I had to sign was not sent to them yet and that they could not submit the paperwork until the 14th of January. And if I come back on the 14th, then I can sign the papers about the $1000 loan and I wouldn’t have to pay it back until my taxes came back, because they will get the money back when my taxes came back. I then came back on the 14th, told them to submit my taxes. After I was done signing my name to all the forms and checking off the boxes that said RAC (refund anticipation check) and how much I was being charged for this kind of check, I was told $32.95. Okay, so I asked the preparer about the $1000 advance. I was told after the fact that they could not give out loans, also I was told that I should get my money in 8 days. All these they told me after they submitted my taxes electronically, which was supposed to be free. I called around the 21st to see if the money was on my card, but there was no loan or money. I called H&R Block to find out when was I to get my money and I was told on the 28th. Well, this is when the IRS releases funds. H&R Block is not telling customers they are going to get their money 15 days from the date we filed, which is the 14th, and that they are having to wait for IRS to release the money/checks. So all I know is that they ran false advertisements ever since Christmas. They are not honoring the 8 days they are claiming to get your money back in, and they can’t and won’t tell you about all that money they charge. all I’m saying is if I wanted to get my taxes back in 15 days, I could have gotten my taxes done for free by IRS because they are ripping folks off. The only reason I let them do my taxes was based on the advertisement they had in the window and they called me to let them do my taxes. I guess they are trying to be the IRS, they are holding people’s money up. Something needs to be done about them taking money from low income people. I’m out of almost $500 fooling with them and their lies and I’m not getting my money back rapidly because that’s the purpose of the refund anticipation check. I’m having to pay their bank for my money that they lied about and bill collectors have been threatening me because H&R Block is telling me one thing and doing something else.
My husband and I have filed our taxes with H and R Block for the last 10 years. Typically, we go for the Refund Anticipation Loan and we walk out the office doors with a check in hand, receiving a second check for the remainder of our return within 3 days. That isn't the case this year. H and R Block is not doing the RAL for 2010 tax returns. We are very disappointed that we were not informed of this change until after the tax preparer had filed our taxes. My husband was injured on the job last year and his employer isn't required to carry workman's comp insurance and there is no unemployment pay for a ranch hand. His employer fired him and he received his last paycheck on Dec. 31, 2010. So, with no income, we were counting on receiving the RAL to take care of many of our bills. Our tax preparer was made aware of our situation as she was going along and asking all the necessary questions to file our return. It wasn't until the very end of the "interview" when she asked us how we'd like to receive our refund, that we were informed "We no longer do the Refund Anticipation Loans". We were also left with the impression that it wasn't just H and R Block but other tax preparers also who are not doing the RAL. Had we been made aware of this change upon entering H and R Block last night, we would have sought to have our taxes done by a different tax preparation service. A simple sign on their front door stating the change would have saved us the stress of finding out we would not have our refund in time to pay our bills. My guess is, they are using the fact that most folks don't know they won't be able to get a RAL, to their advantage. We won't be doing business with H and R Block next year.
My husband and I went into the H&R Block office on the 13th of January 2011. We have been doing our taxes with them for over 6 years and we always went with the RAL loan so that we could get our money at an instant. Well, as I was saying, we went in and sat down with this woman and she gets our taxes done, and not one time, until the very end, did she say they were only doing the RAC this year. She tells us that nobody is doing the RAL this year. Well, we see a commercial the very next day for Jackson Hewitt and a few more giving the loan. We have five kids and depend on that money every year. I feel that we should have been told before we went through with filing our taxes. Plus, they charged us over $400 to file. It has been 8 days and we still have not gotten our money! I will never use them again!
I have been receiving robocalls from this company at odd hours of the early morning, first call was at 2 a.m. and second was at 4:30 a.m. Just today, I got another call at 6:30 a.m. on Saturday the 15th of January 2011. These calls are coming in on my Verizon cell phone and are costing me sleep and money.
I payed for the piece of mind with H&R Block, and found out it wasn't anything more than a way to get more money out of me. I tried to have them to fix their mistake and to make things write, however it was denied. They contacted the woman who done my taxes and she admitted that she made the mistake since I was her first truck driver, and wasn't sure how to handle one. Even after they contacted her and she admitted that she had made a mistake, they still refuse to honor their peace of mind. I had to find out the hard way that is was anything but what the name suggest. I will no longer use them to do my taxes.
On 4/15/10, I filed my taxes with H&R Block in Bullard, TX. On 8/16/10, I met with Kristi in the Bullard office, to get a copy of my W-2, that I needed for financial aid. I had previously noticed on my return, that whereas the form for education credit was filled out, the amount was not transferred to my actual return. I asked Kristi about this, and she verified that it had been overlooked by their agent, and she redid my return, which showed an additional $2,409, due to me. She stated that it would take upwards of 10-12 weeks, and I should not contact her again until then. On 11/1/10, I called the local HRB (Trish), and was informed that my return was being processed, and to call back in a week, if I have not gotten my return. On 11/8/10, I called Trish, and she stated that Kristi said with all the amendments being submitted in October, it could take a while for me to hear something. I asked if they had any status for me, like did the IRS have my amendment? Was there an expected date they would process it? Anything! Trish said Kristi was out sick, and I would have to call her back on Wednesday. On 11/9/10, I got smart and called the IRS myself! They have no record of my amendment. On 11/10/10, I called Kristi and pretty much told her that I am over this. I want HRB to refund me the money by Friday. After all, why am I allowing them to put this all on the IRS? They are the ones who ** up my return. I ended up talking to her manager, and then the local owner. Both proved to be totally useless. They wanted me to come in and sit with one of their agents, and call the IRS together. Why? They couldn't give me a reason. Finally, I just posted on Facebook to HRB. I am trying to find someone at corporate, who I can email, and who may care about the inadequacies of their Texas offices. On 11/11/10, Keith from HRB (online media) called and took all my information. They opened a case, and said I will hear from someone within 24-48 hours. It was 11/15/10, when I called HRB because guess what, they never called me! I spoke to two people, and heard two different things! 1 said that Kristi was supposed to follow up with me. Why would they have her follow up with me? She is part of the problem! Number 2 person said she sees that HRB tried to contact me to close out the case. Really? Then why am I calling you? She informed me that someone would call me by the end of the day, but I could call back if I wanted. No one called and so I posted to Facebook again. I got a response via Facebook saying, I needed to contact the IRS. This is so ridiculous!
I filed my 2007 taxes with H&R Block on 4/12/2008. I was anticipating a refund and was sold on their Rapid Refund option. After 2-3 weeks, I called the IRS and I was told that because I had not filed my 2004 tax return, they were holding onto my refund case I owe for 2004. I found out on November 4, 2010 from the IRS that they did process my refund for 2007 and deposited $2,298.00 plus $419.50 on October 17, 2008. I dug out my copies of my return and called H&R Block on Friday, November 5, 2010. I was informed that they had a record of the $2,298.00 but conveniently not the $419.50 and that they had sent out a pre-paid credit card that was never activated. I was told that they would request a new card. I provided my current address and I was told that it would be sent overnight via FedEx and it would be here no later than Wednesday, 11/10/10. I was also told that I could call on Monday for a tracking number. I called on Wednesday, I asked for a tracking number and I was told that they did not have one and are never given one but that the card was made on 11/8/10 and I would have it no later than Friday, 11/12/10. She also told me that they do not overnight that is why it would take a little longer. Today, I called and I was told that the card was not made and was not on the way. They would request another card and said “Sorry, ma'am!” I requested to speak with a supervisor. After a very long hold, the supervisor told me in fact that there was not a card made or on the way. She told me that they do not overnight through FedEx and then later in the same conversation told me that they did in fact overnight but no one was available to produce the card until Monday and that I should anticipate receipt next Tuesday or Wednesday. I had to make arrangements to leave work early this past Wednesday and again today to receive this card that was never on the way. At this time, they have had my $2,298.00 plus $419.50, which they claim they never received although the IRS confirmed that both amounts were deposited into the same account the same day, for over 2 years. I have been unemployed for the past 6 months and need that money desperately to pay my past due rent. I received my last unemployment check 2 weeks ago and recently started a new 100% commission job that I am still training for. I told Jessa, the supervisor, that I needed the money in my checking account today. She told me that was not possible and they would have to get me the pre-paid card. When I asked for her supervisor, I was denied and told me that she was the top and that there was not anyone else above her and I was just out of luck. “Sorry, ma'am. There is nothing I can do”. I said that I wanted to be refunded the interest earned for the past 2+ years. She said she could request it but they were not going to pay it. From what I have read, this is common. How can they be allowed to continue to steal from people?
I file my taxes every year through H&R Block and last year, I was told about having my tax refund dd to this new card that I had. I said okay. I was also told that I could make deposits to the card and use it as a prepaid card anytime I wanted. I set up a dd from my work to have my paychecks deposited to this card. I went to an ATM one day on a payday to withdraw some money and the ATM said timed out and the machine did not dispense any money. Well, I went home and checked my balance on the computer and it was zero. I called the customer service number on the back of the card. I tried to explain my situation and was told that I made a withdrawal of $102. I tried to explain to them again what had happened and the girl said she would have to transfer me to someone else. She transferred me to the World Bank. The person at World Bank was like, "You have the wrong number." So I called the 800 number again and they transferred me to this guy that sounded like he was a cab driver in a small booth and he told me basically that I was lying and that I would have to wait for a decision for 15 days and then hung up on me! Needless to say, 21 days later, I got my money back but the reps for this company are horrible and their fees are ridiculous. Another one to watch for the fees is Citibank. After dealing with the most outrageous fees and bad customer service from some of these so called banks (rip off artists), it makes me not want to deal with banks at all!
We went to H&R Block to have our 2008 return prepared because we had sold a Canadian second home and wanted to make sure the foreign tax credits and reporting of sale was all done properly. Their website listed George as having experience with Canadian tax filings. George made a gross error in our tax filing and now we have to pay the IRS $30,000 and $3,000 of that is in taxes. He put the same dollar amount in two places. It took 4 of the H&R Block staff (he wasn't there) to figure this out and even they couldn't believe his error. This should have been double checked and caught by either an H&R Block tax preparer or by an algorithm in their software. We paid good money to have experts prepare our return to avoid errors and issues with the IRS. We are appalled and shocked. Not only are we out $3,000 in interest that we are not at fault for since we paid H&R Block to help us avoid mistakes, but we have had months of back and forth with the IRS and H&R Block, letters, phone calls, etc. to get to the bottom of this. We have been very stressed about coming up with $30,000 to repay the IRS. H&R Block should be more accountable for errors they make and should have to pay all interest and a time and stress refund. They will never learn if they're not forced to improve training, audits, etc.
I went to H&R Block to do my taxes. First, I went to get their loan. I was approved for a 600 dollar loan, I used to go Christmas shopping. I went back in January to finish the loan. They approved it. I got the thing were you get it in 2 days. After all, that is a few months went by then. I got a bill from H&R Block 2 pay back the Emerald loan and the next day another letter from H&R Block saying I owe $4,000. Then I got a letter from the IRS saying I owe $2,400. I called everyone and they all said I had to pay, didn't tell me why or anything. I just recently went in to H&R Block and Dan, the worker, said that I couldn't claim my stepson or my own son. I'm like why not he said that I had to bring proof in to prove I cared for them the whole year and a birth certificate for them and all this other stuff. He told me I shouldn't put down my stepson because me and his dad are not legally married and I told him that I didn't know that that's why I went to them. They should know that stuff, it's not my fault.
In February of 2008, we purchased a home. We had heard about the First Time Home Buyers Credit, so when we filed our taxes using H&R Block Tax Cut software, we filled in all the blanks concerning the credit. We were approved to get the credit. We sent our taxes by e-file to the IRS, who accepted it on March 2, 2008 and sent us our refund including the tax credit. Everything was fine until this past week when we received a notice from the IRS stating that we did not qualify for that credit and that we were going to have to pay it back. We didn't know anything about paying it back. When we looked into it, we saw that anyone who got the credit in 2008 had to pay it back. We thought a credit was a credit not a loan. We don't even qualify like others for the 15 annual installments to repay the credit. We will be hit with penalties and interest, all because H&R Block Tax Cut and the IRS in 2008 qualified us. We filed and was accepted before the April 9, 2008 enactment for the credit. We tried to talk to H&R Bloc Tax Cut, but because we had a computer crash and do not have the data file of our taxes anymore were told, "You need to make arrangements with the IRS to make payments, we can't help you." We do still have the hard copy of our taxes that year and worksheets plus the emails showing that we used their software that year to e-file our taxes. I contacted the IRS and asked what date I put on it just to make sure, because the person from Tax Cut said I had made a date mistake is the only way I could have qualified. On form 5405 the date entered was Feb. 6, 2008. I put the correct date. We are being penalized for something that H&R Block Tax Cut and the IRS should have caught and told us that we did not qualify for. Please explain to us why this is happening. We can barely pay our bills and now the IRS wants what little grocery money we have left. We can't afford an attorney to help us. Please say you can, or know who can help us.
The IRS just notified me that my 2008 taxes prepared by H&R Block did not include my unemployment insurance income. Because I had purchased the H&R Block "Piece of Mind" insurance for $30, I wasn't worried. It would cover the $303 additional tax the IRS was seeking. Not quite the case. After a long wait at the H&R Block office, I was told an additional "processing charge" of $120.00 was required. But worse than that, I was told H&R Block does not inventory a client’s tax documentation when taxes are prepared; therefore, H&R Block would need to "make a decision whether they would accept or decline" insuring this error. If they 'ruled' that I never supplied the prepared 1099G form (which I did), then my tab would be: $303 (unpaid tax) plus $120 (paperwork fee) plus $30 (Piece of Mind Insurance already paid for); total is $453. I decided to pay the $303 error H&R Block made and to never go back again. Please note: if H&R Block does not inventory client documents, there is no way to prove you supplied the document; therefore, the $30 'Piece of Mind' Insurance is worthless.
I used H&R block for my tax returns for several years and used their electronic filing. Am I entitled to repayment because they were sued?
H&R Block did my taxes for 2008 and did not put in a withdrawal I took out of my IRA. The IRS sent me a letter the next year and said I owed $2000 in back taxes. I called H&R and told them about the letter from IRS and that I would bring it down to them. I paid for the coverage that if H&R made a mistake they would pay for the work needed and the amount of the mistake. After they looked at the letter, they called me two days later and said there was nothing they would do about it, it was not their fault, the return was sent in wrong. Excuse me, that is what I paid them to do and paid for the coverage if they did anything wrong. Do not go to H&R Block. They do not honor their guarantees!
First of all, this office is the most unprofessional bunch of ** I have ever seen. In 2008, I moved to San Diego. I knew of no one here that could do my taxes. So instead of driving 259 miles, I decided to use H & R Block. The man at the first location, on Mission Gorge Village Square Shopping Center, San Diego, CA 92120, made an error and caused a audit for 125,000 dollars. So I went back but had to go to a different location since that one is seasonal. So I then went to the location at Sunshine Plaza El Cajon, CA 92020 and Lorri did an amendment. Well, I got my taxes back from the IRS and I still owe the same amount. I called to speak to the manager, since now I have decided to go to a real CPA. Immediately, I am supposed to drive to the office show him the papers. I don't want anything to do with them. I just want my money back.
They are the worst. They charged me for Rapid Refund that I did not receive, and they charged someone else’s debt to my account. I ended up getting a check 3 weeks later hundreds of dollars short. I had to constantly call the headquarters for them to refund the money. It's crazy because H and R Block is always talking about how experienced they are. The staffs have no clue. They take training on how to "input your information into the system". Does that make them experts?
I went to file my taxes and was told that I owed back taxes from a business that I previously ran some years back. After being told that I needed to contact the IRS for the information, they stated that they could not give me in calling the IRS to get different information in what was owed. To add to that, the IRS told me to get my information (W2's) back that H and R Block has and they lost all of my documents. I want to sue this company because how are you a tax prep and are losing customers information that is a connection to a person's identity.
My husband filed his taxes with H & R Block this past tax year (2009-2010), as he has the past three years. He owed some money to the child support office. And we were totally expectant of that money coming out of the refund. Only when the back support was paid, we were still owed almost $1,800.00. We waited for our check (knowing it would take a little longer due to the offset). Eventually, the check never arrived. So, my husband started calling to find out what was going on. He was told, "Oh, I see where your check hasn't been cashed. We can void the check and send you a card to activate, and your money will be on the card.” We waited two more weeks. My husband was laid off from his job during this time. We were playing the waiting game. We eventually were evicted - the tax refund was meant to help pay those bills. When on the verge of losing our vehicle, he called H & R Block back. They said, “Oh, we see where a check didn't get cashed; and a card didn't get activated.” He told them, "Because I never received either.” So, she assured him this is fixable. And the "manager" (if that's really who it was) promised to personally overnight another card. You guessed it - we never got it. We lost our home, car, and had to move four times since he filed. We still have not received the money owed to us. There has been no explanation given for why we haven't received it. No one knows what's going on or why. Now, since it's the off-season, the office (the only one open) is open random days at random times. And getting someone (anyone) on the phone is equivalent to relocating heaven and hell. We are still diligently working on getting the money due. I beg off you - if you know anyone even thinking about going through H & R Block for anything, smack them! Tell them that if they want their life damaged or destroyed, go ahead. But if it's money they've worked for or money they need, seek help elsewhere. H & R Block are legal scam artists. If I could afford a lawyer, I would sue. But they haven't even given me money owed to my family, so I don't think they would pay court-ordered money.
I got a letter from the IRS stating I owed $900.00 dollars, H&R block did my taxes. They put in too much tax withheld and now I am responsible. Because I did not purchase the peace of mind, they can't do anything. This is so darn crazy to be responsible for something I paid someone else to do, never again. I will do my own taxes.
I filed my taxes 4 to 5 weeks ago and I have tried to pick them up and pay for them, too. However, no one is present and no one called back. They changed the day they are open to a different day, which is only 1 day a week, without notice to the changes. It was my sole purpose in coming to town. I am very dissatisfied with their negligence and lack of communication. I am a prior customer and have been for many years.
Several years ago, I received via mail a form to fill out regarding H&R Block Lawsuit. The form said I was part of a class of consumers that had been cheated by additional fees applied to advances on tax refunds. I dutifully completed and mailed the form to the Settlement Claims office. Unfortunately I did not keep copies of the forms and subsequently forgot about the matter. Recently, I saw on the internet that a settlement was reached in 2006 or 2007 and I never received any money, no matter how modest. I believe that this may have been yet another scam and that perhaps attorneys involved in the settlement decided to pocket smaller payments, figuring this would go unnoticed. I have used H&R Block Tax Filing and Refund services for nearly two decades. If I was cheated or due compensation because of questionable practices by H&R Block, I want my designated share of the settlement. Again, no matter how modest that may be. I am sure if you know who handled the settlement claims, confirmation of my submission of the claims forms can be obtained.
HRB did my taxes for both 2008 and 2009 at the same time as I have been working in Iraq for about 3 years. They did 2009 first and put most of my $91,400 tax exemption on it. The year that they took out my taxes and giving me a return of over $14k. Then she did the 2008 which was the year that my company did not take out any taxes until I hit the $91,400 mark and I wound up with over $15k tax payment. Instead of putting my exemption on the first $91,400 which would of covered most of the bill and I would have evened out my 2009 return. Now I have their IRS after me for not paying my taxes. They still came up short by $126 too. Now I have a $5,692.15. What can I do? They say they did it right. I don't think so.
My taxes were filed improperly, I was told when my refund came, they would automatically take the money out. My refund didn't come and I was called weekly and threatened that I would be taken to small claims court. I told her I would send payments and still the threatening phone calls persist. I should have known when I walked into office and it smelt like smoke that I was making a mistake. I had to go to different tax preparer, paid them to do my taxes. Just received my refund in July, am going to send payment to HR Block but want it to be known they do bad business and highly recommend you use someone else.
I have a prepaid debit card through this bank and they let someone steal all of the money on the card. Then they gave me the runaround on the phone, hung up on me several times, locked me out of seeing my account online and told me it takes five days to assign a caseworker to my account. Then they will send me paperwork and in about 3 weeks, I might get my money back. This company is a scam. Their call centers are in the Philippines. Now it all makes sense. This happened August of 2010. I will never deal with this company again, nothing but a fraud. I filed a complaint against them with the BBB and filed a report with the FBI. I hope someone has the balls to investigate them. I can't pay bills, I can't pay rent, I can't buy food and I can't buy gas for my car to go to work. I had to cancel a gym membership because I do not have a valid account. No one will accept cash payments for gym memberships. This has cost me a lot of aggravation as well, I can't sleep either. I want all my money back and I want $500 in damages for all this.
Took our taxes to be prepared on January 23rd, 2010 to get our taxes prepared. The worker was Jasmine. She prepared our taxes and said we owed IRS $237.00. Of course, we thought it was unusual, but I had received my monies from disability that I had been waiting on. Well, we left and received a phone call shortly after that says our taxes were incorrectly done and that we would have to do an amended form and mail it to IRS. Well, we waited over 6 weeks and the IRS returned our amendment stating that the original tax forms were not attached to the 1040x, so we in turn went back to the IRS. As usual the manager took over our case and redid our taxes to make sure it was correct and of course she found another mistake: it went from a refund of $2534.00 to $3017.00 and I turned that in on April 12th here in the Monroe IRS office. It has been that long and we still have not received our refund. I have called numerous times and they say they are still working on it. After 20weeks of waiting, I called back and they had to put in a tracer and advised me it would be another 30 to check on our taxes. The 30 days will be up on September 3rd. This ordeal has been too much to handle and I am so angry with how H&R Block charged us $197.00 and wanted the payment right there and then and then charged me $25.00 for the amended form. This is an injustice. I refused to pay for the second amendment form. Well, needless to say, here it is August 2010 and yet no refund. This has caused us to wonder if we are going to owe anything on the original amount that they said we owed plus penalties. This mistake has caused me a lot of pain and anguish.
For several years, I was going to H&R Block for tax preparation/filing, after having been referred to them by a co-worker one year when I was in a crunch to get my taxes done. I was seeing a "tax professional" named Rosalin. I would come very prepared with all of my taxes and would provide her detailed amounts by category of expense for itemized deductions on schedule C. Throughout the years of going to Rosalin, I noticed every year one or two, things that didn't seem right. Such as amounts that were higher or lower than what I provided to them. Her response was always "it has to look this way for you to avoid an audit", and my response was "what if I get audited", and her response was "don't worry about it because you purchased the 'Peace of Mind' package and we will reimburse you." Also, after the first year of tax preparations, she informed me that, I need to be sure to come back to H&R Block because if someone else does my taxes, it will look inconsistent and be a big flag to the IRS and I will get audited. Needless to say, I was audited in July 2009 for the fiscal year of 2007 for an approx. fed return of $5,5k. At that time I contacted Rosalin, who never contacted me back. I became very concerned because in order for the "Peace of Mind" contract to be valid I had to notify H&R Block within 30 days. I ended up having to go to a local office and deal with a very incompetent individual named Lois. In dealing with Lois during the audit period. She provided me several paths of advice as I was preparing all of the proof of purchases to justify the expenses, such as "send them a check for some of the amount so they know you are trying to resolve the situation", so at her advice I provided a check to the IRS/Dept of Treasury for $1,500. I then provided all details to the IRS for the audit at H&R Blocks direction (receipts, letters, emails from business contacts, etc.). I actually had a difficult time finding some expenses to match with the Schedule C that H&R Block prepared because of Rosalin's adjustments to my expenses. There were several months later I received notice from the IRS that they were not accepting a single cent of my expenses, and that I was to owe the amount of my 2007 tax return, plus interest, less the $1,500 that I had provided to them before submitting my audit paperwork. At this point, I was very upset and confused, because I was under the impression that they would at least accept half of my very legitimate business expenses. It was as if all the hard work at trying to start a business and follow a dream was worthless, and not only did I waste money and time investing, but now I owed money because of H&R Blocks deceptions. I continued to liaise with Lois for several months. Wondering what I was to do now, as she informed me they were going to dispute it. I don't believe she ever did anything and eventually after letters from the IRS threatening liens, I paid the "amount owed" in full. H&R Block continues to try and put the blame on me, but I continue to inform them "H&R Block prepared and filed my taxes, you should have asked me these questions when I presented these expenses." In my most recent conversation, I requested copies of all communication between H&R Block and the IRS, and she gave me the run around and then starting talking about how her husband had a stroke, which is unfortunate, but I have been going through a year of hell and out $6k for jobs and services they failed to provide. Because H&R Block is such a major corporation, I wouldn't stand a chance in court with them. Really frustrated, I really do not know which direction to go in. I have heard others with this same problem and wish there was some type of class action lawsuit against this evil company. I paid them for a service and they provided me guarantees and after 1 year nothing has been resolved. Being a financial professional, I should have known better to go to this place, none of these people are CPAs. I would have been better of doing my own taxes like I used to. I got duped.
An entry error was made by a tax preparer on 2008 tax return. The total cost of error is $44,807. I’m not sure where or how to come up with $44k to cover their error. I am ashamed that I trusted someone else to do my tax return.
We have become the object of possible identity theft due to information sent by H&R Block through Telecheck. In speaking with the customer service center, I have learned that H&R Block is aware that Telecheck is subject to phishing and gaining checking account information from checks which they send through Telecheck. Since they are aware of this, I feel that they have knowingly exposed me to this threat. My name address, check number, amount, routing number, and all but one of my account numbers were obtained by Telecheck. Telecheck phoned me. As they appeared legit with all of this information, I corrected the one account number which they had incorrect, as the check had never been presented to my bank. How much other information may have "leaked" from H&R Block and how vulnerable am I now? So far, I have had to close my checking account. This, of course, becomes complicated as I had both echecks and paper checks out. In addition, my tax refund was to be deposited to the now closed account. And my husband's paychecks are direct deposited to the now closed account. Additionally, I am currently without checks or a debit card until all of this is processed and received for the new account. But my greatest concern is what other information could have been obtained. The first efiling was not accepted by the IRS because there was incorrect information on the form. The incorrect information was put there by the preparer despite my having told him differently.
My parents have always filed their taxes with H&R Block. This is regarding their 2008 taxes. It is now 2010. My parents recently received a letter from the IRS stating that they owe $396. They didn't understand what it was about, so they brought it to me to look over. I didn't understand why my parents would owe the IRS money if they paid Nga **, a H&R Block professional, to file their taxes for them. I tried to call her but I was transferred to an operator. The operator told me that she did not see Nga on their calendar at that office any more. So I decided to gather all the papers and take it to a local office. That is when I talked to Donne **, another H&R professional. He didn't make it any better. He told me what was filed is wrong and told me that there is nothing to do but pay the fee. I told him that I thought it was wrong that my parents would have to pay for a mistake that they made while filing and that they should be responsible for that fee. He then told me that my parents should have invested $30 extra in the Care Free program that guarantee that if they made a mistake, then we would not have been responsible for it. Who would actually think that the consumers would have to pay more money to make sure a "professional" would not make a mistake that we would later have to pay for? I think it is wrong that my parents paid Nga $125 to file their taxes for them and get a letter saying they owe $396 because of her mistake. Donne even made matters worse when he said Nga might of had a bad day or was tired and flew through my parents taxes. Seriously? I was livid when he said that. If she didn't want this job to prepare taxes, then why in the world is she there? This all happened just a few hours ago and I am still angry with them. It is ridiculous that consumers pay for a "professional tax preparer" to make a mistake that they will later have to pay for. We should not be liable for their mistakes. H&R Block always have those promotional flyers & commercials stating that they are the "best". Well, this proves that they are not good at what they do and do not keep their word when they say they will pay for any mistake that they make. Needless to say that I will inform my family and friends to stay away from them. They have just lost our business.
My husband and I went to file our 2008 taxes and dealt with the most incompetent person, for a simple straight up return, it took him six hours. We should have known that something was going to go wrong. My husband had two different T4's from one same company and even though we submitted it, he said that these were not needed and chose to not use them and he did reassure us that they were not needed, so he tucked it away. Next thing you know, my husband gets audited, now owes CRA almost $1000. So after working with CRA and figured out the issue, we addressed it with H&R. They had to get the file out from archives, review it, get our story again, have it up for review with management, have management confirm that there were several errors done and finally confirming that a cheque of less than $30 is owed to us to cover the interest. We were told that it would be sent to their office and that we were to pick it up when they called. Never got a call, so we called them looking for this cheque, not that it's going to change our lives, but it's the principal. They've told us that it was mailed out, which happens to be to our old address. When my husband ask how it is possible, the receptionist proceeds to blame my husband for not having calling in our new address. 1.) We were suppose to pick up that cheque. 2.) We didn't file our 2009 taxes through them, so there was no reason to give them a change of address; and 3.) Common sense tells you that you always confirm the address. Anyhow, they don't know where this cheque is, if it's been cashed or returned. They are now launching an investigation. So as it stands, today, July 29, 2010, no cheque and still dealing with incompetent people. Their site states: "At H&R Block, your satisfaction is guaranteed. Copyright 2010 H&R Block Canada, Inc." And their maximum refund guarantee states: "Mistakes are rare at H&R Block." It's false advertisement.
I used the online program to file my taxes. I gave them correct information, and was given a refund of $1900. Four months later, they notified me that due to a "software error", my return had been calculated incorrectly. The error was in the calculation of my student expenses. In the Midwestern States, students are allowed to deduct room and board due to it being a disaster area. H&R Block's software error applied this deduction to all students, not just the Midwestern ones. I now owe the IRS over $900, payable by August 31 (30 days from now). H&R Block's promise to pay the interest and penalties only applies to balances paid before August 31, regardless of whose error it was. As a student paying for my own school, I certainly don't have $900 to spare. I have to pay it out of my school money and hope I can replace it before the semester starts. This error was not mine. I provided accurate information in a timely manner. H&R Block and the IRS offer no way for me to pay this back in installments and avoid outrageous interest and penalties.
We used H&R Block online for our 2009 taxes, as we do most every year. We received a letter in the mail that their online product had a calculation discrepancy. Due to their software error we now owe $107. While this does not sound like much, it is to us. The money we got back from the IRS (2,595) is gone, used to pay bills. We don't have $107. We have been told they will pay any interest owed to the IRS. While that is nice, we are now responsible for a bill we shouldn't have to pay. Getting $2,595 back was wonderful for us, it helped pay some bills. Getting $2,488 would have been wonderful too. It's one thing to never get the money, however once you have gotten it and used it, having to come up with money now is not only hard but unfair. What is the point of paying "professionals" if they can make a mistake and not have to worry about what it cost us. It seems that they should have to have some type of liability insurance to cover their mistakes.
I had to amend my income tax because the first time, it wasn't done correctly. I was told I could not file head of household to, so I could qualify for the child tax credit. So I went to h&r block and they advised me that I could file my son on there and use head of household status. It has been 16 weeks today which is the normal turn around time for amended returns. I received a letter last week informing me I was missing information so I sent back the forms that were never given to me at h&r block and now I am being told by the IRS that my income tax return was never processed because of the missing information, so I have to wait an additional 16 weeks. Please help me, I need it. I do not know what to do. I am so upset about this.
My husband and I have filed our taxes at H&R block for years. We changed locations and began filing at an office closer to home. In 2007 the agent mistakenly entered our daycare receipt twice in the computer, thus doubling our daycare expenses paid. 3 years later, IRS wants money plus interest of $1,034. H&R block says sorry you didn't pay for peace of mind, we pay the fee. Now, I am getting a letter from the IRS for our 2008 taxes! Same thing! Our daycare expenses were entered in twice! Really!? I thought going to a company that specializes in tax preparation could ensure that the $208 I pay each year was giving me "peace of mind" that they could provide accurate services. My husband and I have both had to supplement our income with part-time jobs, we are honest, hardworking people with 3 children and a mortgage, this has truly been a nightmare.
The first time this software had an error, it did not recognize my input of a 401K distribution. When I stopped getting the error, I thought it was fixed. I ended up owing taxes and a fine because the amount was not reflected. This time "2009" taxes the amount owed that is a constant in the window while processing online was a different amount than that on the amount owed online at the end of the taxes. Filing online and saving a pdf to my hard drive. I don't ever need to look at the tax form unless there is a question throughout the year. The amount owed window said $483, but on the line in taxes was $2,483. It still shows this even though HR block's letter denying my claim about their faulty software still shows the same error. I will never use the software again and I will discourage whomever I can from doing the same. Now, I owe IRS and after filing my taxes I paid of $25K in bills and this would have been one of them so there would have not been any IRS debt or interest. HR Block is wrong for not admitting their software has issues and as soon as I find a site to download this sorry letter they sent me, I will.
We have used H&R Block as our tax advisor for the past seven years. I understood the fact that we never received much of a return, but that was better than an audit. This year, there was a complete meltdown. First, we used a new tax advisor for our 2010 taxes this year. People, I have never seen such ineptitude, indecision, and general disregard for our best interest. To make matters worse, the price of tax preparation went from $240.00 to over $500.00. What a scam. No wonder their CEO quit. I would not want to associate my name with H&R Block in any form. The main problem is their defensive attitude when asking questions about your return. I had a question about our state return and set a second appointment to speak to my so-called tax advisor, who promptly informed he had been preparing tax returns for over 20 years and my return was correct. So I wrote my check and sent it to the Comptroller of Maryland and forgot about it. To my surprise, I received another bill from Maryland stating we owed another $773.90 in unpaid taxes and accessed a $25.07 interest penalty and a $77.39 late fee. If I had known we owed additional taxes, I would have paid them. H&R Block charged us more than $500.00 to prepare a married filing jointly return only to screw it up. My confidence in their ability has been shattered. I will never use their services again.
This company made a mistake and now they do not want to claim the mistake. The one who prepared it did not alert me to an email from the IRS about the stimulus from 2009. The assistant I spoke to at first told me that the email concerned the taxes I owed from 2008. The rule is if you make over $25,000, you have to pay taxes on the Social Security that you receive and not on the benefits for the children. This lady that prepared mine assumed I was talking about my child receiving benefits. When the company received the email, they failed to alert or call me about it. They did not act professionally about the situation. I now owe $450.00 for 2008 and the same for 2009. I have the amendment papers ready to mail off but I have to sign them first and look over them. I would not advise anyone to deal with this company because they are revealing to be a scam. This is a very economical burden for me now, when the monies were available right after I filed. The cost of living is forever expensive as I have two children and one of them is in college. I am sleep deprived and worried that the IRS will demand all of the money at one time which they can request. I don't feel that this stress is my fault and can deeply depress me already. I feel I have failed again in life due to someone else's negligence.
I recently received a very disturbing letter from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts assessing me with a nearly $700.00 penalty for an error on the part of H&R Block. Though I pay each year for their "Peace of Mind" promise, I have not received the courtesy of a reply on my fax to Dan ** asking for answers to this dilemma. The State is charging me interest on this assessment for each day that goes by without resolution. Since I am currently unemployed, this penalty assessment is a severe hardship and a huge surprise. It is obvious to me that H&R Block is dragging its feet on helping me, never mind completely disregarding my "Piece of Mind" promise. I am writing them again and faxing Mr. **. Needless to say, the situation is costing me money daily and emotional distress. I simply don't know what to do. Please have an attorney you work with contact me as soon as possible.
I'll make this as concise as possible. We drove about 2 hours to get to this H&R Block. When we got there, we asked to use the flash drive to print off info to amend our taxes. The manager, Rick, came out and was so rude! He didn't explain he couldn't allow us to use the computer. He snapped. I can't express to you how rude this man was. I had my fiance and 6-month old daughter in there and have never felt so belittled by an individual in my life. We left and filed with another company right away without an appointment, but I'm so upset because I live H&R Block. I left and decided to call back and complain to a manager and of course, the manager is this same gentleman, Rick. I told him who I was and apparently he couldn't remember me from 5 minutes prior so I further explained who I was and asked his name, store number and bosses' name. He chuckled and started giving me the info and said he didn't know his bosses name. He sarcastically said he didn't have a phone number to corporate. They called the store. I felt it needed to be addressed. I just hope it gets mentioned to him not to lie to customers that drive so far out of their way to do business and blows it single-handedly. He had no problem going somewhere locally to print what we needed but as a manager and the example for the rest of the store was appalling.
H & R Block apparently had a calculation error for Education credits and now thousands of individuals are facing owing the IRS for their refund.
I had gotten my taxes prepared at H&R Block and they made and error. I got audited by the IRS and meanwhile, I had taken an Anticipated Loan (RAL) from HSBC Bank and when the tax refund did not get release due to the error they made, my nightmare began. I had HSBC bank filed a judgement and I spoke to them and asked them to wait because H&R Block did not see me through the audit. I had to go through this alone. HSBC Bank called my home every hour, called my job, sent a judgement to my job and I got fired. Meanwhile, I have worked with the Tax Payers Advocate and settled the matter and received $1829.00 and HSBC taken it all. They still wanted $271.00. This is not right.
We had our taxes filed through H&R Block in 15 April '10. Afterwards, we had it reviewed by an accounting firm who determined they had made errors in their calculations and we had to file for an amendment. We immediately contacted H&R Block with this information and they refused to review our paperwork. We asked them for a refund as they are supposed to have a 100% Satisfaction Guarantee, but they refused and told us that the accounting firm we went to was incompetent and needed to take a refresher course on tax law. We called the service number for help with this issue on 27 May '10 and filed a complaint and established a case number with them but to date (17June10), we have not even received a return phone call. We have lost $245 for the fees we paid H&R Block to fill out our taxes, which they screwed up. We are also out $200 for having our accountant fix our income taxes and file an amendment and we are still uncertain of the backlash from the IRS.
H&R did my taxes in 2007. In 2008, tax people said we had not filed even though I had sent a check and franchise tax had banked it. I went to H&R and they assured me it would be done. We asked for a copy of paperwork they sent and a phone call to let us know it was done. We did not get the paperwork or the phone call. In 2010, the Franchise Tax Board put a lien on our bank account and took the money saying we owed $800. I went to H&R and they said they would take care of it. Franchise Tax refunded our bank money and H&R told me that Franchise Tax did our taxes as individuals instead of joint therefore the higher tax. They also told me they had only sent one tax return, mine not my wife's. In June 2010, we received a notice that Franchise Tax had taken our 2010 return and added it to the amount owed. I went to H&R and left a copy for Ruth and heard nothing. Three days later, I called and left a message, nothing. One day later, I called and left a message, nothing. I went in to the office the next day and she did not even know who I was and told me she would try and get it today! What do I have to do to get them to fix this quickly?
Several years ago, I received information about a lawsuit against H&R Block regarding overcharging for tax e-filings and refund loans. I filled out the necessary information to become a member of the class action suit. Over the years I forgot about this matter and no longer have original papers. Anyway, I recently found out that the suit was settled and quite frankly, I never received any notification or one dime. I now question whether my settlement, no matter how small, was simply scooped up and kept by one of the law firms handling this action. I believe it was a firm in PA. Have members of the H&R Block Lawsuit all been paid? How is the settlement being (or has been) distributed? Boy, it seems like you can get screwed by the H&R Block and the plethora of attorneys purporting to represent our interests as a class. May 11, 2005, "H&R Block will pay $360 million to settle a class action lawsuit over its tax-refund loans under the terms of a proposed settlement. The company says the settlement gives it a green light to continue the practice in the future."
I filed my taxes with them last year and again this year. Both years there messed up my taxes. I didn't know until this year that messed up lasts year’s taxes. Both years I was told that I will be getting money back. Not until I got a bill from the IRS saying that I owed money, instead of getting money back. I would to know why they did this, and why if they need this big of a mistake that they sold pay these taxes. Instead of me. I will never go there again. The manger can't even do what he said he was going to do for me was gave me a check to cover the interest and plenty, you have your check in two day four day went by and no check, so I called him, al he said was. I'm so glad you called, because I forgot, I told him that no way to run a business and I what my check today, all he said is I will have to get the account and have write you a check out and drop it off to you tomorrow.
I used the Tax Cut software to do my 2008 taxes. We wanted to use them again because of financial difficulties and did not have the money to pay $200 to go to the HR Block office. I have used HR Block for many years. In March of this year 2010, we received a notice from the IRS stating that we owe $4,900+ to the IRS. So I pulled out the 008 file, began researching, only to find out that my return doesn't match what the IRS states as income. I went to the nearest tax office. Our return was reviewed, a letter drawn up and all supporting documents were sent to the IRS. After a few weeks, I received another letter. The IRS wanted copies of all of the W2's, mailed those again. I received another letter from the IRS. Nothing changed they are sticking to the first letter, that we owe money. I went to yet another HR office, only to find out after several weeks, that I have to contact HR Block about this, have to fax all documents received and sent to IRS. This claim will take an estimate of 4-6 weeks to investigate. I used the software trusting the name and experience before. The lady at IRS stated that she sees this all the time, returns not transcribing properly, and items not matching. Now HR Block is calling this a "digital error". Doesn't that mean it is something with the software? So HR Block rep at the 800 number advised us to pay the tax bill and once the case is investigated, if there is any liability on their part, they will reimburse us. First of all, I don't have $4,900+ just laying around to give to the IRS, especially the IRS. So I guess we have to wait. Hope this is taken care of before next tax year. With the state of the economy and living paycheck to paycheck, something would have to suffer. Ok for instance don't make the car payment for, let's see a year to pay the IRS. I see a car repossesion in 3 months, now I can't get to work. I don't buy groceries for my kids, I see a visit from CYS. I don't pay the mortgage in order to pay the IRS. I see yet another foreclosure to be added to the millions already. It is an endless circle!
For my 2008 taxes, I filed my return using the H&R Block online filing service. My return was rejected because the employer tax ID number I entered was not recognized/incorrect. This rejection was never clear to me as the IRS never notified me and the automated email never indicated the error. It became apparent there was a problem when my refund/payment was not processed after waiting patiently. I went into a branch office to ask what I should do. The representative gave me the IRS number and I spoke with a representative of the IRS who explained they received my return, but couldn't process it as there was an error on it. So when filing my 2009 taxes, I decided to not use the online software and paid to have an H&R Block representative file my taxes for me. I also took in my 2008 taxes to have any corrections/amendments made to it based on the issues I experienced initially in its filing. I paid H&R Block to have the rep refile or amend my 2008 taxes to make the filing correct. As I am not a "tax expert", I assumed and trusted them to make the correct filing based on the information they have as a professional tax service. The consequences I have experienced as a result have just made themselves known. I am in contract to buy a home and my lender contacted me on June 4, 2010 to ask me if I filed my 2008 taxes as their underwriting group has not found a 2008 filing for me. I told him I did through H&R Block and had no idea why IRS would not have record of my filing. My lender gave me the IRS phone number and I spent an hour on the phone with a couple of their reps. It turns out that H&R Block filed an amended tax return for 2008, while the IRS never received an original return for 2008. When I contracted with H&R Block for tax preparation services, I did not know what's needed to be filed for 2008. I am not the tax professional and trusted their professional decisions and advice. As a result, this may set back my closing date on the loan by 12 weeks. This is an incredible inconvenience. To make matters worse, I am a first time home buyer eligible for the $8,000 home buyer credit. My anticipated loan closing date was the last week of May 2010/first week of June 2010. At this time, based on IRS processing time for the 2008 paper filing, the return is estimated to take 12 weeks. This delay will cost me $8,000, not to mention, time frustrations and delaying a simple closing by 3 months.
I've been reading too many complaints about H&R Block tax errors and have come to this site to list yet another. I just received a notice from the IRS that I owe them $1,066 federal and $100 state. Turns out Thomas **, who I was informed they fired from their location, prepared my taxes and (1) typed in $54 rather than $5,389 and (2) never entered the refund I was given the previous year. Additionally, this was my first experience with H&R Block. Tom told me not to worry about anything - if any errors occurred, H&R Block would be responsible for payment of all monies involved. What he did not tell me was that you had to sign a "Peace of Mind" paper in order to get this coverage. Although, I double checked that everything would be covered before I left the office and had all my concerns confirmed by Tom, he never presented me with the form. Now, I am responsible for his two errors. Calling their office location gets you a phone number that rings off the hook.
We had received the 8,000 FHB credit this year. For one thing, when we did our taxes, H&R didn't know anything about how to file the FHB credit. They had to look it up. So we gave them all the info they needed to send it off. We picked up a sealed envelope and were told "you're all set". We sent it off expecting our refund in April. Oh boy, did we get a huge shock. The IRS sent it all back due to the lack of the 5404 form. I went to H&R and they agreed that they didn't put the form in there and it was their fault. So now when talking to the IRS, they say it will be August until we get the refund. Can't wait that long for our payment when it would have been here in April if it wasn't for their carelessness. What part of this does H&R have to be accountable for? According to them, nothing. I did receive a $75 coupon for our next visit. That doesn't cut it. It wasn't our fault. They should have made sure the form was in there. Beware.
$280 to file my tax return. On Feb 10, 2010 filed, IRS lost my taxes so we were told to file again. Eight weeks went by and finally they received them. Next thing you know, we get a letter saying that the proper paperwork was not sent in for our first time home buyers credit. Now, we have to wait another 6 to 8 weeks to receive our return. H&R block sent two returns in and both were wrong. No one knew what to send in for this home buyers credit. Meanwhile, I had to file chapter 13 due to bills. I can't believe that it's going to take six months to get our return and of course H&R block charges that much. However, we have not yet paid H&R for doing our taxes and not sure we will after all this.
I received a letter from the IRS about my 2008 taxes. They claimed I owed taxes from this year and that my income was mis-reported. I called H&R block where I had my taxes done and I was told to take them into an office for review. I later found out that a critical part of my taxes was not filed correctly. The income statement was filled out but my tax preparer neglected to file it with my income taxes. H & R Block has left me to deal with the IRS myself and won't return my calls. They have admitted it was their fault and my taxes were done incorrectly. They have done nothing to correct the matter and I don't know if at this point if they are going to pay the penalties and interest due from their mistake. Never again will I ever take my taxes to H&R Block and will warn everyone I know to take them elsewhere or learn to do it themselves. Instead of a refund this year, I owe and don't know where I will come up with this money, H&R Block will not cooperate at all, so much for their "guarantee", it's false advertisement.
I had an education withdrawal from my IRA, so just to be on the safe side, I decided to get my taxes done professionally. I chose H&R Block because it was in my city and convenient for me. I paid over $400 to get them done, and to get them done right. Yet after being told that I would get my refund in about 10 business days, I gave them 15, nothing. I waited a couple more days, nothing. More days, again, nothing. I finally called the office where I got them done and they told me to call the IRS personally. Well, a few moments later, I get the information. My tax forms were sent through their Error Department twice! I am totally dependent on that money right now, and because they messed up, there’s a chance I might lose my job because a car is required and I have to get a tune-up or it won't run. I am so, so angry that I paid that kind of money and all they did was screw me over. I’m very upset! I am about to be given a pink slip because I need a car (traveling job), and I also need a phone for my bosses to contact me. I have been reprimanded a few times because I was not available when they needed me!
On a really large poster, they display their fees. A corporate account was listed as $349.00. First and last time we will use H&R Block. They charged us $690.00 for completing our taxes, $49.00 for completing our sons and $11.00 for our daughters whom didn't make enough to pay federal taxes. Beware, the manager was so rude and said these were their standard charges. I believe that if you are going to list a poster with low amounts of $39.00 - $349.00 you should give a quote if the final cost is $750.00. I took a picture of the poster with the fees. It is very misleading, an expensive lesson to learn. Beware!
They mailed software to my home. The H&R Block price on box was $34.95 for federal and free E file. My credit card was charged $47.65, plus an additional $19.95 for state. I was scammed but I didn't know until I received the bill.
I was charged the next day charge for receiving my refund in two weeks. I was never reimbursed and this is not the first year it happened. I was told that it may not come but I will still be charged if it was put through by H&R Block.

Told them I'd already returned forms but felt they needed to take the responsibility and that I wanted my money immediately. WS told she didn't like my attitude and was hung up on. Called local office again and told them what was going on, said they would get back with me. Nothing yet.
In 2007, I moved from my home in Arlington Heights, Illinois, after my husband died in October of 2006. We had purchased a home together in Amelia Island Plantation, and decided to wait a year before moving in. Unfortunately, he died from a staff infection he received from the hospital. I made the move myself, at the end of November 2007. The following March, I went to H & R Block with my taxes. Because it involved the sale of my home, I took out the extra insurance that they offered, to protect myself. They insisted that it was the right thing to do, so I did. In January of 2008, I received a letter from the IRS, saying that they would like to have a talk with me in my home, of all places. After con firing with H & R block, they said that under no circumstances, should I have them in my home, and that their CPA would take care of it. After a couple of months, they decided to redo my taxes, and then told me that I would be getting back the money I paid .in the amount of $2400.00. Needless to say, I was delighted and promptly used the money I thought I was getting into home repairs. Several months went by, and the CPA who happened to be in the IRS office for another matter, was told by the IRS, that I was not getting the refund, in fact, that I owed $2,900.00. Since they kept adding on penalties, I paid $2974.16 before December 31st, with the understanding that H&R block would refund me the money. Both H &R Block, and the CPA ,admitted that they made the error on my taxes. It is now the end of April, and I am still waiting for my money. Every time I go in, I am told that it has been approved, and it is coming. I am a widow, and in need of those funds. To make matters worse, Mary did not do my taxes last year, even though she had the information she needed a month in advance. She called me on tax day, and said she couldn't get to them, and filed an extension. I am finding out that the extension is only good for 6 months, and this is over a year. Every time I go in, I get the runaround. I had to have knee surgery, and was out of commission for almost two months. I am always told that I will hear from her, and I never do. I am at my wit's end, and don't know where to turn. I was told that I have to go to the corporate office, but I am getting the runaround there too. If there is anything you could do for me, I would be very grateful. I have been paying taxes for over 60 years, and have never ever had problems with the IRS. I would appreciate your consideration. I am out of money I can ill afford, and the stress of the entire situation has not been good to my high blood pressure.
On October 22, 2009, my finance and I just closed on our first home together. We went directly to H and R Block, from closing, which is about 5 minutes away, to get my 2008 taxes amended for the first time home buyers credit. We had every piece of paper ever given to us in hand, since we just closed. Anyway I got my taxes amended and was given an envelope to mail them off, which we did directly after leaving. We paid with check the services that cost $62.00. Time went by, so around mid January 2010, I was balancing my checkbook and had noticed that H&R block had not cashed my $62.00 check yet. So, I called H&R to see why. I was told by the same person who did the work that we had a zero balance with H&R. She had no idea why the check hadn't gone through, since her records showed that we had been paid in full. We were advised to write the check off as a void (this didn’t make much since at all). We are paid in full. So 3 weeks went by and I was balancing the checkbook again, and had noticed the H&R had cashed my check after telling me I was paid in full. I called H&R and talked to the same lady. Her answer was, “So and so didn't call you. We found your check under our cash register 3 months later.” And they cashed it anyway. I was told that she had not had all the information in front of her at the time that I called to check on the check. So in other words, her first mistake is my fault. Around this time as well I called the IRS, just wondering if H&R cashing my check late would affect the $8000.00 that we are supposed to be receiving. That was when I was told for the first time that there were some complications with our amended return. But no one could tell me what they were. The only thing that I was told was that there was something missing, that I should be expecting a letter in the mail, explaining what paperwork was missing. Also, I was told that my account would be put on hold for 30 days, in time to respond to the letter. At this point I called H&R to see if there was anything that they could tell me or knew of what was going on, since they were the ones who put this paperwork together. I was told I would just have to wait for the letter. When the 30 days was up, I called the IRS back and explained the situation again. First, I found out that the address they had for me in their system was the address that I lived at in 2008, rather than the address of the home that I just purchased. The only thing that the IRS customer service agent could tell me is what I already knew, something was missing. The agent was trying to be helpful, since I had my 2008 amended taxes in front of me. The agent and I went through them and discovered that I was missing a 5405 form, in my copy. So, the agent put in another inquiry. Well, my account was put on another 30 day holding period, while waiting for this letter and having found out new information. I called H&R block again and explained to them the new information I had received: involving the wrong address in the system and also that I was missing a 5405 form. I simply asked if this was the issue that I have not received this check or letter. Would they consider returning the $62.00 that we had originally paid to have this service done, due to the fact that it was their mistake? H&R response was, “We are not able to return your money, until it is proven that it was their mistake, and this is all waging on that letter to arrive.” Another 30 days passed without this letter. I went to H&R Block with every piece of paper work that they had given me. I sat down with an agent and within 3 minutes she gave me a copy of my 5404 form and instructions on what I should bring to the local IRS building. Over that weekend I received a packet from the IRS stating that my first time home buyers tax credit of $8000.00 is going to be disallowed, due to no response to the letter and missing paperwork which I have, till this day, never received. That next Monday I went back to H&R and showed the same agent I have been working with from the beginning of all this the packet I had received. Her response was, “Well you should have brought that letter in sooner.” Once again I explained to her that I have never received a letter, and if I had, I would have brought it in. Obviously, she was not listening to me. I asked her if she could help me. She just threw her arms up in the air and said, “No. Nothing I can do.” Once again I asked if the local IRS is able to find out what paperwork is missing, and it turns out to be a fault on your part. Will you return my $62.00? The response was, “Personally I can’t return your money for any reason.” At this point, I asked for her manager’s business card. I left and went to the local IRS building. Once again I explained the situation. The IRS agent was able to pull up my file and discovered that the settlement paper was missing. He then made a copy of the settlement papers, and wrote a letter briefly explaining the situation, and why I had not responded to the letter. He faxed them to the IRS. That’s where I am at now. H&R block will not take any responsibility for not including the settlement papers. This agent has 30 years of experience. How could you not include the only other paperwork that needed to be included? It’s in black and white right in front of her, and she still will not admit that it's a mistake by her, that has caused this delay. We were told by the IRS that they received our amended taxes on October 27, 2009. That money has been sitting there also for 6 months now, earning interest that we are going to have to pay taxes on next. I know that $62.00 isn't a lot of money, but I believe it's the whole point of taking responsibility for your actions. Until this day April 21, 2010, I have still not received a letter, check, or a sorry, or acknowledgement of fault from H&R Block.
I have filed my taxes with H&R Block for years. I did this year also. I do not have a problem with H&R Block in any way. It's the card they issue from Emerald that I have had nothing but problems with. My tax refund was returned for 2 weeks before I could get it put on to the card. It took me over 3 hours on the phone with Emerald Account Services to get the money put on to the correct card. I was lied to and told it would be there in an hour. It was not so I called back and was told I would need a new card because I was using the wrong one. When I asked how that is possible, the people at account services told me because they mailed me a replacement card. We then argued about what address it was sent. After 20 minutes arguing that the card was sent to an address I do not live at the man with the heavy accent that was "assisting" me admitted that yes it was mailed to the wrong address. Now that I finally do have the money on the card, my card was retained by an ATM I attempted to use. I put in the proper pin # one time and lost the card on Friday. I went in the bank talked to the Emerald Account Services yet again and received my card back. Today, Tuesday my card doesn't work. When I asked the representative why I was told there was a hold placed on it Friday. They didn't tell about a hold when I called from the bank, the card worked all weekend. My husband and I are separated and filed jointly so when I called to get it fixed, they wouldn't even let me because his name appears 1st on the account. I will never use Emerald again and recommend that no one else does.
H&R Block prepared my tax return. I was told I owed zero. Then he asked another preparer a question and that person said he had done it wrong. I had to leave and come back the next day. In the end, I owed. But they had depreciated the land as well as the house from real estate I sold. I told him I didn't think you could do that, but he disagreed. I was right. The preparer did not have the training or skills to do a return involving real estate. I said I would return later to pick it up and did not. They wanted $419.00 to prepare it. I went to an enrolled agent, paid much less and got it done for $130.00. I have since heard similar stories from friends. H&R Block sent me a bill, which I am not about to pay. But I have to go through an involved process. I need to fill out a form with all the information, mail it in, allow them to investigate the situation with the location I used and then they will get back to me to let me know what they are going to do. Never again!
In February of 2008, I employed the services of H&R Block to prepare my 2008 tax returns. That year I purchased my first home and was in need of expertise in filing my taxes. I had previously used H&R Block's online tax preparation service and was pleased with the result so I chose to work with a tax advisor at the H&R Block on Hawthorne Street in Portland Oregon. My tax preparer was Jonathan **. I came prepared with all relevant documentation including my W2, mortgage interest statement and 1099R. I spent approximately 45 minutes with Jonathan who assured me that H&R Block guaranteed accurate tax filing with a direct deposit of my refund to come within two weeks. After several weeks without seeing the refund, I followed up with H&R Block and was told that Jonathan made an error in filing the return which resulted in a delay of my refund. While I was disappointed, I was willing to accept that mistakes occasionally occur and was glad to see that H&R Block accepted responsibility for their error. Fast forward one year. In April of 2010, I received a letter from the IRS stating that my gross income had been miscalculated in my 2008 tax return and as I result I owed additional taxes and was not longer eligible for the first time home buyers credit. The amount owed to the IRS is over $3300. The miscalculation was a result of my 1099R not being filed/ listed with my return. Jonathan at H&R Block had all documentation including the 1099R so I was shocked to see that he had not included the distribution in my return. I went to H&R Block because they promote themselves as tax professionals and guarantee accuracy. In fact, on your website, which I have subsequently visited, it explicitly states: "Absolute Expertise. Up-to-date knowledge, extensive training and state-of-the-art technology ensures we get your taxes done right." Upon receipt of the IRS letter, I immediately contacted H&R Block confident that you would take responsibility for your error. I worked with Manson at the H&R Block location at 2700 NE Sandy Blvd. My 2008 tax return was amended and I was told that I did in fact owe the additional taxes and while H&R Block would not charge me for amendment services they were not going to take responsibility for the miscalculation. When I inquired about the guarantee of accuracy that is heavily promoted in all of your marketing material I was told that I had not purchased additional insurance and as such H&R Block would not be taking responsibility for your error. I was never informed about additional insurance at the time of my original filing. I made a choice to use H&R Block because of the accuracy guarantee and positioning of tax expertise. I am extremely disappointed that you do not own up to a mistake that one of your employees made and have made misleading statements in your promotional materials.
My father who is 82+ years of age has gone to H&R Block for the last 3-4 years to get his taxes done. He is recovering from a stroke which happened 1 month ago. I, his oldest daughter, did his taxes this year and decided to look at his past file copies from H&R for guidance. I found that they charged him $200 last year for doing his 2008 taxes for an income of $6,000 with a $127 refund! When I asked my father about this, he said, "Yes, they're expensive, and that's what they charge." When I went through his paperwork, I found that they had sent my father a letter with a "standing" appointment for this year's taxes. They have been ripping him off for the last 4 years. Yes, my father went there willingly; however, they should have turned him away or referred him to the local Office on Aging. Instead, they treated him like a pigeon! Smiling at him while taking his money! I contacted the Office on Aging of Somerset County who recommended that I contact you. Help! Please, these people should be put on notice about taking advantage of other people like my father, who really has nothing of value. He's a widower and will talk to anyone and doesn't realize/or won't accept that it makes him an easy mark! Please contact me with any questions you may have. Thank you!
I went in for my taxes to be prepared on Monday April 13th, 2010 at 7pm. My complaint is this: the fee I was charged was astronomical. I paid $391 which was never explained to me. I felt that I was mislead because I was asked a series of questions and then out came this huge bill. I did not itemize anything nor was my situation complicated to warrant these outrageous fees. When I inquired on why this is so outrageous I was told by the prepared that he does not determine how much to charge. I believe that H and R Block is luring in customers and ripping them off by commanding these huge fee's after the fact. Just as they are capable of asking you a series of predetermining questions in the beginning of the appointment, they are capable of prescreening and offering the consumer a rough estimate in the beginning of what fees to expect. I was never offered an opportunity to decline to continue the appointment. I was offered to have the taxes sent and the fee's subtracted when I received the refund...and of course for an additional fee. This is one big money making scam after the next. I called the regional office to file a complaint. I received a call back from a rep by the name of Nira. She proceeded to tell me that I should not have continued with the appointment. My response was that I was unaware that I could do that and no one told me it was an option. She said "Unfortunately, the office would not tell you that"! I am outraged that the staff withheld this valuable information from me which was my right as a consumer to know! What outrages me more is the fact that I cannot afford to spend money in this manner. My taxes reflect a yearly income of about $22,000. I am an unemployed single mother and I feel as if I was preyed upon. I was able to find additional grievances online similar to mine and h and R Block should be penalized for its unlawful and immoral practices. Please consider this information and help me obtain justice. Thank you in advance.
I have been using H&R Block for about six years, and until now merely thought them expensive. Now, I will never use H&R Block again, and specifically because of a Shelton, CT representative named Lisa Dias. The reps there asked us to drive back to their office 6 times over the course of three days, in each instance begging us for more time. The last day was April 15th, deadline day, and included four visits by us, beginning at 11 am and not finishing until almost 10 PM. The H&R Block reps gave us wildly different numbers on our tax return each time we went, varying by as much as $2000. The first rep we spoke to, Lisa **, was (besides being dressed to go night-clubbing) demonstrably and quite obviously incompetent; repeatedly asking other reps to help her understand what she was doing. When we questioned the numbers, she became defensive and sharply commented that we should defer to her opinion. The second and third reps who worked on our not-that-complicated return were less offensive, but again gave us different numbers with very little technical explanation of our questions Needless to say, we are totally without confidence in the accuracy of our tax return this year, and we will be paying more money for a private, real tax accountant to check and amend it. To add insult to this frustration, when I privately (to my spouse in the cubicle), after this marathon ordeal at about 9 PM on April 15th, expressed my opinion of their incompetence, Lisa ** stood up from across the room and began verbally berating us, yelling that she was a professional and that she wasn't going to take comments like that from us. Her manager and other reps had to pull her away. No one apologized to us. If I were managing this site, Lisa would have been fired on the spot. This is the most unprofessional company I have ever done business with. They clearly hire unqualified people off the street, there is very little supervision or quality control, and we ended up with a tax return that is likely late (the post office doors were closed by the time H&R Block was done with this nonsense) and likely incorrect. I have filed a complaint with the FTC as well, and my spouse pointed out that now there is a deranged woman out there with all of our personal information in her possession. H&R Block offered no assurances or apologies. The other reps in the room simply avoided eye contact with us after her ravings.
I have had my taxes done by H&R Block for 50 years. Each year, the cost increases are astronomical. I do not mind paying for the necessary forms that are needed to complete my taxes. I had underpaid my MN state taxes by $114.00. When the totals for their services were tallied, I noticed a charge of $15.00 more to the State of MN. I have no problem with that. What I have a problem with is that H&R Block had charged me $36.25 because of this underpayment. This is a total ripoff and unacceptable. I discussed this with the representative to no avail and wanted to get my returns done so I have no alternative but to accept their plan. This needs to be looked in to. I have also told them that this is probably the last straw and that I would look elsewhere next year if I need help with my return.
H&R Block is falsely advertising they will process "basic" tax returns for as little as $39 and this is false advertising at its best! My taxes were indeed basic but H&R Block charged me more than 4 times as much as they advertised. I called on the H&R Block office in Pearland (Shadow Creek next to HEB (713) 436-7751) on 3 separate occasions and asked for assistance regarding filing my 2009 tax return. I specifically asked about the cost because the on line information provided is not crystal clear and I wanted clarification since $39 seemed too good to be true. I was assured over the phone and in person that because I was using only one W-2, I would only be charged the basic $39 rate. I then explained to the representative that I was concerned about how much I would owe to the IRS because I was laid off from December 2008 to November 2009 and I elected not to have taxes taken from my unemployment benefits. She then assured me that my circumstance was still straightforward and she couldn't foresee not processing my tax return for the basic price advertised on television. My scheduled appointment was Saturday, April 10 at 11:30am. The first 10 minutes with the H&R Block representative were spent assuring me she would take great care of me, reviewing the documents the previous two representatives suggested I bring with me, and pressuring me to sign a document that stated I would pay the fees charged after my tax return was processed. The final 10 minutes were spent watching her use my one W-2 form, the 1099-G form and a mortgage tax statement I was told was needed to determine if the amount I owed would increase or decrease based on the information on the statement. After a total of 3 minutes (if indeed it was that long) of watching the H&R Block representative use Turbo Tax software (which she asked if I used when filing in prior years) she pushed enter, printed out my tax return and gleefully announced I did not owe the IRS and would receive a refund of $595. She then pushed the final button on her keyboard which resulted in a fee screen appearing with what I can only state was outrageous! $171.50! She stated the fees are calculated by some fancy H&R Block software which determines the fee according to how many documents they use to process your tax return (remember, each time I spoke to a representative and told them "my story", they insisted I bring additional documents because otherwise just providing the amounts in my head to place into the system would be insufficient even though I knew them to be true). She then handed me a "price list" (which no one bothered to show me prior to signing the ridiculous legal form and she would not let me leave with a copy of the price list) and uttered some crack-head gibberish that made no sense about my 1099-G and mortgage statement not being on the price list but the software calculated the fees anyway and bada-bing bada-boom, $171.50. With the hope of making the look of utter dismay disappear from my face, she then added, "of course H&R Block only charges you to the nearest dollar amount so it's only $171 even") and quickly picked up all the paperwork (she generated) and walked immediately to the front of the office to process my payment. I begrudgingly paid the absurd fee. However, the more I have thought about it, the more I see that H&R Block is like the rest of the money grubbing greedy bottom feeders falsely advertising services for less while all the while scheming the average consumer out of their hard earned money and needs to be stopped or at best "outed" for being no better than common con-artists. H&R Block ripped me off and I know I can't be the only one.
My husband and I had our taxes done by Cindy on March 27th. We have gone to this H&R Block office for over 10 years. When we got home, I was telling our son about what we owed, which we usually do, and he said, "What about your re-doing the two rooms, since you put new windows, doors, insulation etc." I told him I forgot about that since we had done it in early March of 2009. So I called Cindy, told her what happened. She said she'd pull our tax report back and note it as a test until she heard from me. She told me to get receipts for exterior doors, windows, insulation, ceiling fans, and recessed lighting. I called the next day, the 28th, told her the total was $$2559. She said that we would be cutting off what we owe by $700. She then said she would fix the paperwork and send new voucher to us. We live approximately 15 miles from Richland so mail delivery would take maybe a day, no longer than two. By Thurs, 4/1/10, we hadn't received anything from her so I called the office, spoke with Cindy and she said it should be arriving soon. I called again on 4/3/10, still no paperwork. Cindy said the runner had just picked it up that day and would have it by next week. We didn't get anything on Monday, waited until Tuesday, nothing. So I called. The lady who answered the phone said Cindy was with client and would take a message and have her call me back. She called later saying it was on its way. Wednesday, nothing. Again, I called, left message to call me. She didn't return my call that night. Thursday, nothing in mail. I called and this time I told the lady who answered that I wasn't leaving any messages since Cindy didn't return my call yesterday. She put me through to Cindy. Cindy said she didn't know why we hadn't received it but would look into it. By Saturday, nothing in mail. So on Monday, 4/12/10, I took work off and went to H&R Block. Cindy wasn't there. I spoke to the lady at reception area, telling her my plight, then another employee, Barb, overheard what I was saying and took me back to a workstation. She got into the computer and looked up our return. Cindy never made any adjustments to our return. She sent it just we had seen it Saturday morning. I asked Barb why would Cindy have lied to us all this time? She said she didn't know but would talk to Cindy later that day. Tuesday evening, I got a call from Barb saying Cindy did the amendment but we would have to pay what we initially had to, then send in the amendment for the refund. I said I could pick it up and there was no charge. I told her there shouldn't be a charge. It wasn't our fault, plus we already paid them $233. I picked up the amendment Wednesday and when the lady thanked me, I told her we would never be back and I was going to tell everyone I know about this situation. These are suppose to be professionals working for H&R Block. Evidently, they are not. Maybe H&R better start training more and checking on their employees. In all the years we dealt with them, I never doubted what they did. Now, I wonder what else they screwed up and that's why we were always paying so much. Just think twice before using H&R Block.
I went to H&R Block for the first time because my girlfriend convinced me. She has used them for the past 10 years. I bought my first home in 2010 and am getting a First Time Home Buyer's tax credit and therefore couldn't be electronically filed and had to be mailed in. All I heard from everybody in the office was that we have to mail it in and not specifically me. I waited a week before I got my paperwork back which was just handed to me by the secretary and I went home thinking that was all I had to do. Seven weeks went by and I hadn't received anything in the mail yet so I called Pat to see if everything was fine and that was when I found out that I was supposed to mail the returns in. Now at this point, I am steaming mad because I paid over $350 for something I could have done myself at home and expected them to take care of everything. I called to see if I could get some of my money back and was told absolutely not because it's just a given that when mailing is mentioned at anytime then it's on my side to do it. I felt like I was treated unfairly and was just pushed out of the door. I will never go back to H&R Block and my girlfriend said she is never going to go there again. They messed up because we would have continued to go there the rest of our lives which adds up to a substantial amount of money that they are going to lose. I had to pay the $353 up front and make myself late on my mortgage payment which in turn hurt my credit.
When I arrived for my 1PM appointment at H&R Block, I was told there was a "scheduling snafew". The adviser I was scheduled to see was just finishing up with a couple and would see me next. I was told that if I worked with another lady, she would put my data in the computer, so when I saw the adviser it would be quick and easy. I spent over two hours with this lady, who I learned was the receptionist because she stopped what she was doing with me to answer the phone and help other people. When I finally was seen by the adviser, he ended up putting most of the information in again anyway. I spent over three hours in the office. H & R Block charged over $500.00 to waste two hours of my time. When I called to file a complaint, the lady who returned the call was defensive. She told me scheduling errors happen and offered to give me a discount on having my taxes done next year. I said "no thanks", why would I return to a place that charged me and wasted my time for their mistake?
I filed my 2008 taxes with H&R Block. Nothing was disclosed about the fees, until after my taxes were filed with the accountant, or else I would not have filed with them. I ended up owing them $372 to file. I was shocked, and I had to pay because he had already filed. I owed close to $3,000 in taxes on top of everything. All he did was punch in numbers. It was the worst experience I've had doing taxes. I will never go back.
I was a repeat customer. Last year in 2008, the cost of my tax preparation was $99.00. This year, I made an appointment, and the fee wasn't disclosed until Thomas was completely through with my preparation. It cost me $259.00. Nothing was disclosed at the beginning of the appointment. Nothing has changed in my deductions, W2's--nothing! I felt I was scammed and obligated to pay so I handed him my credit card. I was ** and did not even enjoy it! I told Thomas they had just lost a customer and that I would never be back.
I went to do my taxes today, realizing that it was going to be expensive--thinking about $150 or so. I took the "tax expert" less than 45 minutes to do my taxes and was charged $270. That means they are making $360 an hour! I can't figure out why it cost so much, I wasn't given an itemized receipt. I had two jobs, so two forms for that--a student loan, and three or four interest income sheets. No one could give me an exact price, just that the computer charges per form that you have. I requested their corporate headquarters address but no one was able to access it. The manager offered to look at my return to see what was going on and said that she might be able to refund some of my money. When I returned three hours later, she looked at me blankly and said that she hadn't looked at it yet, and I said, "Forget it, I'm heading out of town and I don't have time for this." She handed it to me without a word. Also, at the beginning of the meeting, I was handed two sheets to sign--one was an arbitration agreement which I signed and the other was a sheet that I was told I must sign in order for them to do my taxes. I read it thoroughly and it was basically a consent for them to sell you services--savings account, IRA, etc. and use your information for marketing purposes. It said plainly on the form that you don't have to sign it and if they make you sign it, then your signature is void. I pointed this out to the woman who did my taxes and said that I am not signing it and she said that I had to. I refused and she went to the manager and came back and said I didn't have to do it. I said I know. She said that this, she never knew, that it wasn't mandatory to sign the form. $270 is way more than I have to pay someone to do my taxes when there are much cheaper options out there such as Turbotax.
I have been doing business with H&R block for several years in the state of New York without issue. In September of 2008, I moved to Yuma, Arizona and started working in Yuma that same month. I called H&R block in Feb of 2009. I contacted H&R block in Yuma, AZ to find out what I would need to do to file as I had two W2's from the state of New York and one from Arizona. I was given an appointment for 2/24/09 with Barbara H as she was "experienced" in doing out of state tax. I arrived at H&R block with three W2's one from Catskill Regional Medical center, one from the state of New York and one from Paradise Cove here in Yuma. She went through what seemed like the usual process. I signed the forms as always without reservation as I never had an issue prior. I trusted them. I was offered the "peace of mind" for an extra $30 and declined as again I never had a reason to worry. I was told I was approved for the RAL and given a number to call to check the status. I was informed it would be 1-2 days. I was charged the amount of $423 for them to do my taxes. I did not receive my RAL in 1-2 days. When I called the number provided, it was denied. I called H&R block and was told it was more than likely due to being out of state. I did not receive any compensation for that from H&R block nor did I pursue it. I finally received my tax return. It may have been close to 10 days and thought it was done for another year or so I thought. I received a letter from the IRS the end of December of 2009 explaining that I owed them $1,156. Since I did not understand why I received this letter, I called and spoke with Barbara. She asked me to bring the letter in to her and being it was New Year's eve, she requested I bring it the Monday after that. I agreed. I brought the letter to her and she informed me that she would call me and let me know what the problem was. During that time, my parents were visiting from New York and while I was at work, my mother received three phone calls from Barbara on 1/5/2010 that she "lost" the letter from the IRS and needed me to give her another copy of it. I faxed the copy to her the following morning and followed up to make sure it was received. She stated it was. After a few days, she called to inform me I did not claim one of the W2's and that was the problem. I was more than baffled as I gave her all three. She told me I "should look around." I asked her where I gave them to her. I checked the envelope she gave me and it was not there. I called and informed her. She stated she would have to amend it and I would owe them. I know I brought them all in to her. In fact, I took them out at her desk, with my ID that she did not ask for. She was shuffling papers all over while she was putting the information in. I was paying attention to my nine-month old grandson so I did not see what she did. After days of going back and forth and given different amounts owed and different information by different staff, I requested to speak with a manager that was the end of January. Her name is Birgut. She is the "owner." She passed the problem for Rosario to handle a manager from another office. Weeks went by with no information. I called and was told by Rosario "someone from my staff was supposed to call you." No one did! They were still "waiting" and "don't worry we will take care of it." After a month or more of being patient, I called to speak with the owner. I was given Birgut. She assured me they were working in it. I asked that this matter be resolved as it was being dragged on long enough. I was asked on several occasions, "Do you have peace of mind?" My reply was, "No, I do not," as I declined it when asked. Come to find out, I found in looking at my records that in fact I was charged for it so I did have it and no one even found it and I am sure did not bother to look I brought that to their attention. Their response was "a mistake in your favor." I was told I needed to sign an amended return. Birgut stated she would bring them to the office closest to me so I would not have to go out of my way once again. There I met with Janet, another office manager. She was helpful and did try to explain things. I was told I had to pay the state of Arizona $39 which I did. I was charged $68 for them to do my tax for this year. I was assured there would be no problems. The IRS is taking my tax for this year which was only $829 as I don't make very much here in Arizona. I have received letters from the IRS stating I owe them more then $1,500. I am told to fax them to Birgut and Janet and I did and I continue to hear nothing. On 4/12/2010, I received a call from Janet explaining my refund was declined due to an "error code 511" which means someone "claimed me as a spouse" so now the money they were going to take has been declined as well. Yet another mistake! They were informed in 2/09 I have been separated from my husband as of 2007. We live in separate states so they filed this years incorrectly as well. I was informed by Birgut that I have to "wait to see if the insurance company approves it," "anything I can send will help with my case." My case? Send them what? I gave them my W2's. I have nothing. They made the mistake in the first place which snowballed into other mistakes. In the meantime, my taxes for 2008 are all messed up. I owe money I should not owe. There have been several mistakes made and I have been bounced around from one person that has no clue to another. I do not get calls returned. I get "I didn't forget about you we are still waiting" as per Birgut. I am stressed to the max about this and no one from H&R block has resolved this nor have I been refunded the money they owe which I still have no idea what the amount even is as I never get a straight answer from them and I am still in limbo. The end of April will be four months I have been stressing over this. I know what I brought with me when I filed 2/09. I know how much they charged me which was a lot of money and still no one can explain the charge. I know that I paid for "peace of mind" I declined and is doing me no good. I know they made several mistakes and I am paying for it. I was given a number to call the IRS. Should they not have to take care of that? That is what I paid them for. I do not understand the tax laws, period. What I do know is I have the IRS breathing down my throat. All I am asking for is for this matter to be resolved. They made a mistake, they should fix it, pay the money owed and move forward. I would appreciate any assistance you can offer or even the right direction as I am at a complete loss with them. I look forward to hearing from you.
I work for H & R Block and I am very pleased there. One thing I have noticed is that people who get products like Refund Anticipation Loans do not take the time to read the fine print. Please read the fine print before you sign any legal document. It wouldn't bother to have a customer read the documentation. You pay your money to get your taxes done there and you deserve the time, in my opinion. Yet, I have not seen one person stop and read the fine print yet. We, as employees, are required by law to show each client the differences in costs and time frames of getting loans versus not getting a loan and waiting for your funds. It is very clear, explained several times, and put in writing on the computer screen during the interview and in two different paper documents. Direct deposit of your funds is usually quite quick. I, myself, would choose that option, and it doesn't cost anything extra. If your funds are taken for money you owed, you owed it. Own up to it. That's one less bill you owe. If you are strapped for money - Refund Anticipation Loans to get your funds quickly are an extra expense. Good luck! I had to pass some hefty testing and experience to work there. I love working with the public and everyone has a unique story.
It was our first time utilizing H&R Block accounting services to prepare and file our tax returns. Usually, we use the free software, because our returns are rather simple and we are low-income. But since one of us has began a very small business out of home, we thought it would be good to have the expertise and professional oversight. I stated our case and details over the phone before we made an appointment. In that initial conversation, I was told that the total fees would come to about $200. I ended up having to pay over triple that. It turned out that if you are a touring artist, playing at multiple venues and those venues each send 1099s, you have to pay H&R Block for each 1099 they enter. Our schedule C alone came to $300. Not that an accountant has a duty to assess our situation first and to provide cost-saving options, it just seems like the moral thing to advise two low-income individuals, operating at a significant loss, what the real H&R fees are going to be and how they will be assessed before the process begins. We weren't even asked about deducting utilities used for the home business. Ah, well, any return this year is going straight toward paying off this bill.
I have been going to this woman for 3 years to do my taxes. It was until yesterday that she informed me that my filing status is incorrect, and I need to let my employer know immediately that they need to change it, because they are not taking enough taxes when they process payroll. It wasn't until I owed $700.00 to Uncle Sam, that she decided to let me know my filing status is incorrect. I'm questioning why Cecilia didn't let me know my status was incorrect the first time I did my taxes with her. I haven't slept, thinking how I'm supposed to pay my bills now, after this chunk is deducted my bank account. Luckily, I don't have any children.
I initiated the process to have my taxes done and I was unhappy with the service. The representative gave me the option of not going on if I was not satisfied. I chose not to complete the process and now a couple months later H&R Block is saying I owe them the cost of the service. I have gotten my taxes done elsewhere and I am not financially stable to pay this after being giving the option of not completing the process.
I electronically filed my 2008 taxes with them and paid almost $300 (including their insurance) and I just received a letter from the IRS stating that I never filed my taxes. I paid for a service I never received. I even contacted several of their offices a month after I filed my taxes to find out the reason I never received my return and they gave me the run around for several months. So, technically they lied to me! I noticed that the tax filing did not have a name of the person that actually did my taxes but someone else’s. I did not receive my tax return which was going to a savings account (interest) and now I have to run around a file my taxes again since the IRS gave me a deadline. The consequences are the time off work to fix this and the stress this is causing me, plus the almost $300 I paid for a service I did not receive.
I am a military member. H&R Block did not disclose the fees until after everything was filed then said the total of $260. Since everything was filed, I felt obligated to pay the fee. I also did not have $260 in my account so H&R Block said they would take it from my refund via my bank account for another fee of $50, with grand total of $310.
H&R Block advertised "50% off what you paid last year" for new clients. What does that mean? To me, it means they'll charge half what you paid last year. To them, it means a credit this year of half what you paid last year. Last year, I paid $450. This year, I was charged $680. "50% off", not so. Deceptive, if not completely false advertising. I will never again use H&R Block.
I gave Mr. John ** all my tax info on myself and my children on March 27. He only required my children's SS numbers and the copy of 2008 tax form, which I provided him on March 29. I am a single mother of 2 minors and had no employment in all of 2009. Mr. John ** gave me the distinct impression I would probably not even need to file a return. When I came back for my follow-up appointment, he told me, because I have a Vanguard account, which I have a small sum to live off of, I would have to file, the fee would be $295.00. Then he said, "Oh by the way, we have to file a return for your 2 children due to capital gains increase on their college funds. For each of these filings, I was charged $280.00, that's $560.00! Mr. John ** sprung this on me without any warning, knowing for days that this would happen, he failed to inform me until I was in his office and was basically stuck without any choices of an alternate way to file. Otherwise, I would have consulted a relative who would have filed the children for me without charging this ridiculous fee! I have since contacted the office manager and emailed the district manager. I believe what Mr. John ** did was underhanded and unprofessional! I was never lead to believe I would have to file returns for my children. This is unacceptable. I only expect to be refunded the fee for their filings only. I have contacted my credit card company to dispute this charge. I will never do business wuth H&R Block again. This is not the kind of treatment or expectations I had of this company.
I went to H&R Block on March 23, 2010 in Elgin, Texas to review my taxes. I had all 2009 paperwork, but didn't have my copy of prepared tax to compare taxes. So they said they could do a practice test without a lot of detail about a practice test what it really was, I continued on. Taxes prepered by Betty, I was charged $29.00 for a practice test that showed no detail information on a work sheet, then I asked for a copy of the practice test and I was told she couldn't give me a copy of it until they spoke to the manger. To get to the point, I was charged for a practice test with no information to compare taxes to and second, the calculations were completely off to and from what I will be submitting to IRS. I was informed not to go to H&R Block because of the stories others have told me about taxes being done incorrectly and high fees being charged. I will not refer anyone to H&R Block to anyone. When a business offers a service and doesn't have any customers, ask yourself should you go in? I was swindled out of $29.00 by H&R Block 214 A US Hwy 290 E Elgin, Texas 78621.
I wished I had found this blog prior to filing my taxes. I too was asked to pay $29.95 despite declining numerous times that I did not want to upgrade nor file a State return. So it does not matter what you answer. They will find a way to charge you. In addition, there were too many "bugs" in the software. It took me 2 days to do my return. The program refused to accept my zip code, and I could not proceed. I had to change my mailing address for the program to allow me to proceed. In addition, I had to call the IRS to calculate the taxable amount as box 2 (a) of my 1099-R was left blank. The program will not allow you to proceed unless you input an amount. I have a long history with H&R e-file, and I'm thoroughly disappointed with their level of competency and above all, integrity. Caveat emptor!
I just left H&R Block with my taxes untouched. I had my taxes done by Dennis ** on 3/23/2010. They charged me $195.00 for a simple form. I'm attending school, so I needed to show taxes for 2008 also. I could not find them and swore I had filed. The school made a phone call for me and found that I hadn't filed. So the IRS printed out my w2's for me and faxed them over to the school. I took them to Dennis ** to have them done, and he told me that he was overwhelmed by me and didn't act like he knew what he was doing. In fact, the first time I had them done by him, he had to ask for help from a couple of the girls who worked there. Dennis left the office to go ask another co-worker how to handle my return and came back to ask me if I was prepared to pay to have my taxes done today. I asked why he thought I would have to pay. He said because I had taken out my 401K early, and he assumed it was for living expenses only, not even that polite. There was a 10% penalty for taking it out early. I said there had already been taxes withheld by Merrill Lynch for $961.00. Then he said the second amount was the rollover amount and wouldn't be taxed. Now I'm really confused. So I said, "You won't do my taxes, because you feel I don't have money to pay to have them done today?" "No, I didn't say I wouldn't do them," he said. "Then what are you saying? I'm totally confused! Dennis, shhhhh, I'm going to do a trial tax to see if I can find out if you will owe." I left to get some water, and I came back to see that he has stopped doing anything. He apologized and told me again "I"m sorry, but you just really have me flabbergasted. I don't know what....., let me go ask again." I heard his co-worker mention cold hard cash. Again, I was so upset. I said, "So you can't tell me how much this will cost me?" Dennis: Will you have the money to pay today. Me: Again, how much, a couple of thousand what? Dennis: Well, how much are you getting back from last year? Me: A couple of thousand. So if I owe a couple of thousand, then it will all come out in the wash. Dennis: Well, let's hope not. Me: Okay, so I guess I'll go home and try to figure out what I'll owe. Dennis: Well can you do that? Me: I guess I have to. I will need a friend to help. Dennis: Well, if you can do that, then that would be better and you won't have to pay us. As I'm walking out, I'm thinking that I really should try to talk to someone else to see if this is all true and the way they really treat people. Dennis escorted me to the door. He acted like he knew I was looking for someone to talk to and did not want me to. I got in my car and called the Peoria office and let them know what had happened, and I'm now waiting to hear from them. Boy, were they really going to charge me that much to do my taxes? Do I look like I have no money? I ended up crying and feel stupid for it now, but I work full time as a caregiver and go to school 20 hours. I'm a 55-year-old woman and attending school for my CDL. Truck driving license, lots to learn, and I don't want to be a flake like the people at H&R Block. I want to know what the hell I'm doing when I get behind the wheel of that rig!
I showed my preparer my last year's return, and I told her that my 2009 income and deductions would be similar. She quoted me a $300 to $400 fee. She refused me a written estimate, saying that H&R Block does not do that. She ended up charging me $562 (which includes $30 for their "Peace of Mind"). If $350 is a good average between her quoted $300 and $400, then she overcharged me $182.
I went to H&R Block last year to file my taxes. I am a young professional with uncomplicated taxes so I normally do my own tax. Last year though, I had to file 2 state taxes and I decided not to deal with potential complications. When I arrived at the H&R Block office, I told the receptionist that I wanted someone knowledgeable about tax. Lo and behold, they gave me a "tax expert" who just started working as a tax preparer. How do I know? I asked during my chit-chat and found out Devona, the tax preparer, took some tax classes and that 2009 was her first year. Great. I decided to roll the dice since the office was quite packed and I did not want to wait long hours nor did I want to come another day. Right off the bat she faced difficulty preparing my taxes. I became really nervous. Devona kept on leaving her desk to consult with her seniors. At one point, she left her desk and I approached someone who I think was more experienced than Devona. This person was older than Devona and seemed to be the manager of the office at Penn Ave. She assured me that Devona was capable of handling my taxes. I was furious because the mistakes that she made were rookie mistakes. She kept on jumping from one form to another and at times she was talking to herself as if she was trying to reassure herself. I could tell she was nervous, too. When she finally finished preparing my tax, the manager checked her results. In the end, the manager agreed to waive the majority of my fees because she knew I was not happy. I still had to pay $130, but I was not about to contest that. I was too tired to do so. It's my own stupidity too, that I did not check this tax file. When I realized that I could get a higher refund, it's a little too late. The mistake was this: instead of claiming a tax credit, Devona took out a deduction. I ran my math and found out that if I were to claim a credit, I would have gotten approximately $500 more in my tax refund. I can certainly file a 1040X, but the point is this : If you have simple tax situations, it probably doesn't matter much to whom you go, but if you have complicated tax situations, it is wise to choose to whom you consult. Don't make my mistake! If you get a newbie tax preparer for your complicated situations, say "No" and save yourself from asking "What if..." down the road.
Brought my Mother in on April 27th, we had an appointment at 11 with Kim, when we got there, there were two women who were not interest in helping us except for telling us that one had switched hours with Kim and they couldn't find my Mother's returns (my sister-in-law had dropped them off at an earlier day) and maybe we would have to come back at another time (when I made the appointment I had made it with Kim and couldn't get an appointment with her till the 27th). We came from out of town and I had left several # to contact me if it was going to be a problem with that date. I told them I had no interest in driving over again from Sartell. They finally found Mom's returns, told she owed around $1,000. Mom said she couldn't afford that all at one time. They she should call the IRS never offered us an extension form or even a phone # but charged my 79-year old Mother $138.00 for basically three simple forms. The two women in there made us feel like we were intruding on there personal time and there was no one in the office beside us. I will never enter another office of the H&R Block and will not ever refer anyone to them ever. Mom is not able to drive around to get forms, has trouble with hearing on the phone or does not have access to the internet.
In 2002, I used the H & R Block office located in Chesapeake, VA 23320 to file my personal taxes for year ending 2002. I was notified in 2007 that NC Department of Revenue was placing a garnishment for tax period ending 2002. I lived in NC and worked in VA. My wages were garnished every week until early this year 2010. After looking at my return that H & R Block did, I realized something was grossly in error. I contacted NC Dept. of Revenue and they instructed me to get a copy from the IRS for that year, which I did. After reviewing the documents, the representative told me that H & R Block, in error, did not forward the appropriate documents to them. Thus resulting in my 3 year garnishment, loss of wages, losing a vehicle, my home, etc. It was horrible! When I attempted to contact H & R Block, I have been given nothing but a run-a-round, phone numbers that no one seems to answer ever! They guarantee a service that they completely fail to support! I incurred over $2,000 in penalties and interest due to their error, not including fees charged by my employer for handling this garnishment that never should have been, had they done what they are over paid to take care of, on behalf of the consumer! It has been 3 weeks now and no results. So I am writing in hopes that there are other people with similar issues with H & R Block's gross neglect. Emotional strain and economic loss!
I went to have my taxes done today and I am very disappointed with the service. I am not sure if my taxes were prepared by a tax specialist or the receptionist as every time the phone rang or someone walked into the office, she stopped helping me and answered the phone, took messages for other preparers that were with clients or greeted incoming customers. The really disappointing fact was that I had multiple withdrawals from an IRA for housing and medical which involved penalties and I was told that the program will only allow me to enter one or the other penalty deduction. I had to show the preparer how to enter them both as the program was similar to the Tax Act program I usually use. For the money that they charge, $480.00 in my case, the client should at least get full attention from a preparer that is familiar with the tax program they are using. After speaking with the manager and getting nothing but apologies, I mailed a letter to H&R Block headquarters stating my concerns since they do not provide an email address for complaints; needless to say, I have not received a reply.
I went and had them prepare my taxes.The tax preparer informed me that it would cost $300 dollars to complete my taxes. I had forgotten my $30 off coupon but the preparer offered me a $25 off coupon. My total should have been $275 a little higher than usual but fine. As the preparer sent my taxes through e-file the power in the office went off. The preparer told me that she would send me my papers since there was no power. Their fee would be deducted from my return that would be automatically put into my bank account. Later when I received my return, I realized that they had charged me $328.85. They did not apply the coupon and had charged me for a refund anticipation check (which I did not receive) and for $30 audit guarantee (that I was initially charged in $300 amount and did not agree to. I wasn't able to dispute these charges because 2 weeks passed and they never sent me my tax forms or fee charges paperwork. I had to personally go to the office and demand my paperwork after I complained about the charges. They were refusing to give my copy of the taxes I overpaid for. I have spoken to the manager Philip **and have not received any help or sufficient explanation about the charges. Under the law, I know I had three days to dispute a loan anticipation check but did not have the paperwork to know I had signed up for it and even if I did, I never received that check. I got the money put into my bank account no anticipation loan check.
He did not type in the childcare disbursement account figure from my w-2. IRS is charging me for taxes due 1,200.00 for a simple mistake. H & R Block paid for interest but not for the now (one year later) due amount.
I hope I am not too late to stop people going there. Although the person was very nice and I am assuming not her fault, I have to say I will never recommend H&R Block to anyone especially my family and friends. In fact, I am too embarrassed to tell anyone just how much it was. I asked at the beginning how much it was going to be but was told she wouldn't know until it was done. Never thinking that it would be so much $368.00. I was shocked. I never paid that much. If I knew I would not have had them done at H&R Block. My tax return did not involve that much that it would cost so much and took less than an hour. Imagine less than an hour at that price. Needless to say I am $368.00 more in debt when I left and out of work since 2/09. I wished I checked the comments from people online before I went.
Accompanied my son to have his taxes prepared. He basically had little or no income, been unemployed and not receiving unemployment benefits. Had no ownership of any sort and is a renter. He did have a 1099-misc and because of that we ended up paying an enormous additional fee. At the end of the short session she charged $261. I myself pay my tax accountant $120 to do my taxes which include investments. You want complaints! Looks like you have them according to this site and you obviously aren't paying attention to the scam these people are charging. I may not receive a credit of any sort on this but I'm certainly presenting my paperwork and receipt of payment to the attention of our Attorney General of Minnesota. There is also a group I'm contacting through Whistleblower and an Investigative group at one of our TV Networks. Her answer was 'but your getting money back! After paying them off, maybe $200. He was not in a position to pay that and it came out of my budget and I'm retired. I certainly don't want to be contacted by an attorney. Getting the necessary information to our Attorney General is sufficient for me.
After having multiple year history with my H&R Block account after the IRS directed me to them for free filing. This year, after spending time doing my free federal tax filing, when I reached the end, it said I was in the $19.95 paid version. When I called up to complain that I started out as free version, they said at some point the software asks if I want to upgrade to $19.95 and if I don't decline, I'm automatically upgraded. I demanded that I be brought back to the free version and they said they are not setup to downgrade accounts back to free. If I want my free version, I have to create a new account without any history, start over, and make sure I don't fall into the same trap again. Their customer service say they are not equipped to fix this problem. Wasted time and if I hadn't noticed this fraud, it would have cost me $19.95. The IRS should not direct people to such a deceptive practicing company. Now I have to find a new trustworthy place and have to restart my history.
My husband and I filed our taxes with HR Block on Feb 27, 2010 and as of March 23, 2010, we are still having problems. When we filed our taxes that day, it was a beginning of our nightmares. After our tax preparer finished the last steps of our taxes, she told us we were her 3rd client that day. We thought she was finished and would receive our money in minutes, but we didn't. 4 days later, we found out she did not complete it. We had to go back and sign off on a job we thought she did. We received partial of our payment that day. 2 weeks passed and we are looking for the remaining balance due to us, so we called again. We were asked to come back to the office because of the 1st preparer's errors, so we did. At that time, the IRS would not give them access to our account so the HR Block manager could fix the problem. We waited 5 weeks for our remaining balance which the IRS took $500 from a previous year caused by HR Block errors. We finally received a remaining balance from the IRS that shocked me. We where missing over a thousand dollars from HR Block fees! We received that balance on Feb.19, 2010. It's now March 23, 2010 and we have not received a state tax yet! I called HR Block on March 19, 2010. She just gave me a call back today explaining that they did not send off on our state tax and we would have to come back down to the office to sign yet another form and mail that off for our state tax. I am so upset at this point, I am boiling over! I have 8 kids and I don't have time for this.
I used H&R Block Free File for my Federal Taxes. I did E-File and everything went smoothly until I got to the end and it wouldn’t let me finish my Federal unless I signed up to do my State (for $29.95). I was going to do my own State taxes and send them in. Finally, I said what the heck, I'll just do them now and have them E-Filed also. So I paid with my credit card $29.95 and did my State taxes. It said they were accepted, I gave all the information again for E-File to my checking account. Then it comes back as rejected E-File status. I had no errors to correct. I went back through Federal and State again, everything was good. I have tried everything for over a month to figure out why it won’t go through. This was back on February 2. Now I have to wait till June to get my refund. It’s $19.95 if you want to ask any questions. That's ridiculous. I have used H&R Block for a few years now and have not had any trouble. I’m very disappointed. I will definitely use the IRS free service next year.
In Oct. 2007, the company I worked for went under and I lost my job. I went on unemployment for a couple weeks before having back surgery and switching from unemployment to state disability insurance. When 2008 rolled around, I received my tax information from the CA EDD Office. I was concerned because they stated that all compensation was State Unemployment and therefore all taxable. I went to my neighborhood H&;R Block to have them do my taxes and questioned the tax professional doing my taxes in regards to State Disability being taxable. He stated that "State Disability is never taxable" than adjusted the tax owed accordingly to the 2 weeks I collected State Unemployment. When he completed filling out all the pages and came to the part of asking me if I would like to get their "Peace of Mind" service, I hesitated for a minute and he said because I really wasn't getting much back, it probably wouldn't be worth the price. I agreed. He's the tax expert so I was sure my taxes were done correctly. In 2009, I received another tax form from the CA EDD Office. This was for Jan. 2008 and 10 days in Feb. 2008, that I was still on State Disability. Once again, I went back to H&R Block to the same gentleman who did my taxes the year before and once again he assured me that State Disability was not taxable and my return was again very small and not worth paying for the "Peace of Mind" Service. I followed his advise once more. One month later, I received a letter from the IRS stating I owed over $700 in taxes I didn't pay in 2007. It was for the CA EDD tax. I sent them a letter stating my case and how I wasn't on Unemployment for more then 2 weeks and that EDD had made an error. Another month or so went by and I received another letter from the IRS stating the taxes were due and I needed to pay them. I worked with someone who worked at H&R Block in the evenings and he called a gentleman (Paul) who was in upper management with H&R Block and had been with H&R for over 25 yrs. On speaker phone, he proceeded to tell me he knows all the tax laws and State Disability was never taxable! He said whomever was sending me these forms had no idea what they were doing. I again contacted the IRS but this time by phone and it was explained to me that State Disability is never taxable by the state and was not usually taxable by the Federal Gov. Unless you happen to be on State Unemployment prior to going on State Disability which was exactly what I did. I decided to contact the District Manager for H&R Block Carlos **. I explain the situation and asked if they could still help me even though I didn't pay for the "Peace of Mind." He at first was very helpful and told me not to worry he would look into the situation and contact the IRS for me and that they would pay all penalties and interest accumulated. Weeks went by and I never heard back from Carlos but I did receive another letter from the IRS demanding their money as well as listed additional interest charges. I contacted Carlos once again via email to see what had happened when he contacted the IRS on my behalf. It took Carlos several more days before he responded to my email and when he did, he proceeded to tell me that there was nothing he could do for me except to refund the money I paid to have my taxes done in 2008. That I should have paid for the "Peace of Mind" service they offer and then he could help me further. I explained again that it was his tax professional who told me it wasn't worth it since I was going to receive less than $100 back on my returns. He was also the one who stated that State Disability was not taxable! Carlos again stated that other then the $47 refund check he was going to have sent to me, there was nothing further he could do to assist me. He also stated that I didn't have to worry about paying the IRS right away that they would work it out with me during this years tax season. I now owe the IRS the $740.46 plus late fees & interest. I'm expecting to receive another letter for the taxes I didn't pay on my 2008 forms which is for about the same amount time as 2007. I'm receiving letters monthly with more penalties & interest added. I've also been sent a certified letter that I haven't had time to pick-up due to the hours I've been working. I am a single woman trying hard to survive economically & thanks to H&R Block I have even more financial problems than I can handle!
Do yourself a favor, do not patronize H&R Block. I made the mistake of going to them because my CPA was on maternity leave. What a mistake. Firstly, if you are filing long form and choose H&R Block, you are exposing yourself to be ripped off. I have filed long form for better than 15 years now. I know the drill. I have the paperwork and numbers ready. After spending more than two hours with the H&R Block rep, she tried to tell me paying $500 for her to file my taxes was going toward her 8+ weeks of specialized tax prep training and court appearance fees if necessary. I never paid this amount to a CPA. I've paid no more than $350 in the last 10 years and nothing dramatically changed in my tax status in order for this to be acceptable. So I asked for an itemized statement of the work performed in order to make a qualified decision as to whether I should have them proceed with my tax filing. This is what any intelligent consumer would ask. They refused. Why do you think? Luckily for me, my brother sits on the board of H&R Block. I cannot wait to hear his evaluation of this situation. Nonetheless, be forewarned. H&R Block is negligent.
I would never recommend going to them. My tax return was $355 and I had to pay $135 to get them, which is ridiculous. Waste of money! The girl had no idea what she was doing. I had to ask around for help. I should have just done them myself because I probably would have done a better job than her.
I went into H&R Block in Acworth, Ga on March 13, 2010. I had already used the free online federal and state tax filing service. I was so surprised at the amount I was getting in refunds. I am extremely anal and wanted a professional to do my taxes. I did not trust my own self. I did the taxes at their office. My appointment was for 10 am and I waited for one hour to be seen. When I was finally seen, this very friendly gentleman took care of everything. Wham, bam, thank you ma'am--we were done. I was told that I would get a nice sizeable refund, same as the online calculations and qualified for the RAL--the classic emerald card. My refund would be available in 2 days or less. I have horrible credit and was told by the preparer that it did not matter that my approval was based on my refund amount. Well, I checked the balance on day 2 and it is zero! I called the bank and was told that I was denied and that there was retention with the IRS, and if fund were available, it would be in 2 weeks! I have even tried to look at the info online with the IRS and of course their system is down! I should have known that a big refund was too good to be true and getting back in 2 days was also too good to be true! I will keep trying though. Do your own taxes and be patient with snail mail!
When I did my 2008 taxes, using the H&R Block's 2008 Tax Cut premium, I declared a $5000 capital stock loss. The tax program used $3000 to offset 2008 income. When I began my 2009 taxes, using the H&R Block's at Home Deluxe edition, it did not pick up the extra $2000 capital loss and pass it into the 2009 edition. I noticed that the 2008 edition did not have a place for the carry forward to be printed in my file copy and perhaps it has no software variable to save the carry forward amount. Thus, the 2009 edition has no variable in which to put the amount. I do not have their software code, so I am unable to determine the problem on my own. I reported my discovery to H&R Block last week but no response yet. I may have made a mistake somewhere but cannot see how. It appears to me that the software does not carry any excess losses forward into future years. I wonder how long this has been the case and how many taxpayers did not catch this mistake and thus paid taxes on up to $3000 in extra income. If their software does not have the ability to carry forward excess capital losses then the taxpayer will pay tax on a increased income.
This is regarding my 2008 Kansas state tax return. Each year for many years, we have been hiring H&aR Block to prepare and file our federal and state tax returns. Prior to the 2008 filing, we had worked with a very competent tax preparer. When we had our 2008 taxes prepared, this person was no longer working with Block due to her full-time job as manager of a local bank and conflict of interest, we were told. We asked for someone of "equal" knowledge and skill level with experience, and we were assigned to "Kathryn **." It was quite obvious to my wife and I during the meeting that Ms. Kathryn had lots of questions she was asking us that should have been evident by reviewing our previous 2007 tax statements, which she had at her fingertips online in their database. She kept reassuring us that there was no real way an error could be made, because that office had senior preparers who reviewed these returns before any of them were actually filed. She got up from her desk several times to verify procedures with co-workers which we thought was odd, if she in fact was experienced. But we also thought she was just being cautious? We trusted her to do a correct job and paid for the service. One year later, we receive a letter from the Kansas Depatment of Revenue putting us on notice that we withheld tax from the report we filed due to an error on our part. I started attempting to contact H&R Block, but absolutely, no one would call me back or no email was responded to online. I then went into the Mission office, and they told me they could just review this error when they completed my 2009 taxes. They reminded me that I had not purchased their $30 "peace of mind" guarantee, so there was really no guarantee that the taxes were filed correctly, but they would reimburse us for small penalties and interest eventually. We demanded to have a more experienced preparer, and we're assigned to someone who was able to quickly determine what Kathryn ** did (did not do) in 2008. Both my wife and I work for government jobs and have the state KPERS retirement. Ms. Kathryn failed to report the correct income on our W-2's which was clearly stated and has always been reported the same way each year, as we have worked in our jobs for many years--same job, same filing, same W-2 format. After threatening calls and emails, we did receive the penalty and interest back, and we were scared into paying the $30 "peace of mind" fee for our 2009, as we did not want to be hassled with this again! I am just here to tell you that this company is not accountable for their mistakes, and they will not apologize for a blatant error!! They just throw a $30 fee in your face and let you know you cannot complain unless you paid the fee! I am not sure of how they would have treated me if I had paid the fee, but perhaps I will find out. When I attempted to call the corporate office, they honestly made me talk to untrained folks who could barely speak English. And then when I asked for a manager or supervisor, they told me they did not have any supervisors and I would need to talk to them! They would open a complaint ticket and check into it. And "Oh by the way, had I purchased the $30 'peace of mind' thing?" This company is not reputable and does not stand behind their product! We will shop around for more credible preparers next year.
Mr. S. prepared my taxes. I paid $175. I got home and discovered the hard copy of the return had an error. I returned to H&R Block to report the error. Mr. S. filed an amended return. I received a letter from NYS saying the amended return was not filed correctly and was missing information. I returned to H&R Block a third time, lodged my complaint regarding their inefficiency, told them I had no faith in their expertise, and requested my $175 back. H&R Block refuses to refund my money when they bumbled my return twice! (1) I had to lose valuable personal time by going to H&R Block three times and ultimately, I am filing my own return. (2) NYS letter gives me 15 days to provide missing information which caused me undue stress. (3) H&R Block is withholding money from me for services they did not render. What's more, this money could be in my bank account earning interest.
I called on 3/5/10 to get information on the cost of tax preparation. The rep quoted me about $175. I made the appointment for Sunday. Before heading in, I went on the H&R block website and started a return so I would have an idea of how much my refund would be. When I got to the office, the preparer pulled all the information that I had already entered online. Then I was charged $276! My problem is three-fold: (1) the price they quoted was no where near what I was charged; (2) I did 75% of the work by entering information online; (3) If I am paying for "expert" or "professional" services from H&R block, then why wasn't a CPA preparing my taxes? I called their customer service and filed a complaint. They also charged me $20 for RAC, I couldn't get a straight answer on what it was. I also didn't get an itemized receipt of their charges which I requested.
I used the H&R Block free e-filing software to prepare the 2009 tax return for my brother, my parents and myself. I access H&R website through the IRS web site. Their website states: "You can file federal taxes for FREE if you earn $57,000 or less adjusted gross income and you are under 51 years old last year. State Taxes Only $9.95." I entered the federal and state information for my brother. He was due no state refund and at the end I was quoted $9.95. I entered my federal and state information (I earned less than $57,000 and younger than 51) and I was quoted $27.95 for filing my state taxes. I entered my parents. As soon as I entered their age, the system told me that they do not qualify for free federal return and that I will be charged $14.95. I accepted. At the end of entering their information, I was quoted $14.95 for federal and $36.95 for filing state return. So I called their office to find out what is going on. Why have I gotten three different prices for filing state returns and why it keeps going up when the amount of state return increase. I was told that my parents no longer qualify for the $9.95 for filing State if they don’t qualify for free federal return. I said nowhere that is stated on their website. I asked them how was I been charged $27.95 though I qualify for free Federal. They said it was because I was on their "free file and not their free edition software," which makes absolutely no since to me. I paid the $36.95 for my parents because it was going to take me too much time to do it all over again. I am wondering how many persons are being swindled like this.
I’ve been dealing with HR Block over 10 years and I’ve been a victim by their over charging their customer too much for the loans. I could have some of that money save up for my college or save up for my four kids or may have been able to buy a home, but that money they have, and I don’t understand what’s going on. We need our money. We earned that. No one did it for us. We worked for those hours. Thanks.
I have always done my own taxes, but just bought a house and wanted to make sure I filed for the first time home buyers credit correctly, so I went to H&R Block. We finished the paper work and I said I wanted Direct Deposit, so he asked me for my checkbook to get my routing number and account number. After he entered it, he asked me to read it to him, so he could double check the numbers to be sure they were right. I did so and he said it was all good. After waiting 40 days, the IRS web site said my refund was deposited in my account, but when I checked my account, it wasn't there. I called the bank and they said no deposit was made or was even pending. I finally realized I needed to check my copy of my return to make sure the numbers for my account were right and of course, they were not! So I called H&R and let them know the mistake they had made. Their response was the deposit will get kicked back to the IRS and when they get it back (who knows how long that takes), the IRS will issue a paper check and you should get it in the mail in hopefully a month or so. Because they are sorry they made this mistake, they will do my taxes for free next year, like I want them to do that after this happened! They did not offer me a refund of services, which I feel was the least they could do, nor did they care one bit that I needed that money very badly right now, to pay off expenses from buying my new house. They didn't even offer to contact the IRS to make sure my refund gets sent to me. I will be making sure everyone I know does not ever use H&R Block again and I will post on every site possible. If you need your return quickly, do not use them!
Prepared my taxes on line with their "free" software. Their software was dropping/adding digits to bank account #'s and when the direct deposit was made, my bank refused it because the account # was incorrect. H&R Block takes no responsibility for this and now I have to wait an additional 3-4 weeks for my check to be sent manually by IRS.
I have been doing my taxes with H&R Block since 2001 and this year is the first for problems. Everything was perfect till the next day, I got a call saying the IRS denied my return which I had already got part of my refund the day before and had to take printouts of everything to my IRS Building and turn everything. Someone claimed to be my daughter without permission through Block as well. So I have been calling the refund hotline and checking the status. Well I called this morning and it said it's scheduled to be direct deposited into my account today. Well I looked at my copy of everything because I don't have an account and Block said IRS would have to mail me my check. Well then explain to me why there is an account number and routing number on my tax return and why Block charged me almost $300 to do my taxes when it was only to W2s and baby sitting. I only sat there for less then 30 minutes. I know one thing Block, I better have my money today. I ain't never had a problem till now and if I don't have my money in my hand today, they will lose me and everyone else. I know a lot of people and they know people. You don't tell someone the IRS will mail the check and then put an account number on there and never tell your customer about it. That's just messed up rude. I wonder if I had not been checking and keeping an eye on it, if they would have ever even opened their mouth and told me. I guess I'll find out today when I call because I'm very unhappy and disappointed.
I made an appointment on January 15 to file with H&R Block as I usually do every year. I recently graduated and heard about new credit that was created this tax year "the American Opportunity Credit." When I asked Monica *** about this credit, she knew nothing about it and said I did not qualify for this credit. I assumed she knew what she was doing and trusted her with my tax return so I left disappointed with my return. Very small. So This was bugging me and I checked into it with the IRS' website and lo and behold, I did qualify. So I called H&R Block and spoke with Maggie (supervisor). I explained what happened and let her know I did qualify and H&R Block needed to amend my return. She agreed and said it would be no charge. So I had to make an appointment on January 28 with Monica *** again. I specifically asked for a manager to do my amendment and Maggie told me there would be a manager there while my amendment was being done because I felt a lack on knowledge on Monica's part. So I went to my appointment. No manager was there. I sat at Monica's cubicle area and she proceeded to pull her out her "notebook" on how to file an amendment. I explained to her what she did, told her she said I didn't qualify for the credit but then didn't quite understand when she tried to charge me an additional $160 on top of the $260 I paid for my original return. She then recomputed the fees and said I would need to pay $60. I said I wanted a manager. This was not my error. This was hers for being uneducated on tax credits and laws. She brought back someone who was not a manager but was helpful (Glen). I explained what happened and he zeroed out the fee. She then tried to file the amendment electronically and stated, "Oh, you have to send a paper amendment in by mail." So now, here I sit, waiting 8-12 weeks or longer for my return when I could have received it all at one time when I e-filed. I paid almost $300 for "expert" serviced by a "licensed" professional. I needed that money to pay my bills. I am a single mother of three children and depend on my own income to support them. I could have had the money in three days and now I have to wait three months or longer, I have been told by the IRS. If I pay out of my hard earned money, $300, I expect accuracy and results. I will never again use H&R Block and I have spread the word to my friends and family to do the same.
I would like to start out by saying that my representative was very cordial and informative about my tax situation. I had a very positive experience for the three and a half hours, I was there but my problem started when my taxes were over and done. That is when I found out what my cost was, not before we spent all the time doing them. I had to pay H&R block $520.00 twice what I paid for my taxes last year. After so much time and effort I hesitantly agreed to accept the rip-off charges. My only difference in the previous years taxes compared to this years was the fact that I had a rental property to include. I was told by my representative that these prices were beyond his control and that if I had a problem with the charges I should fill out a H&R survey and let them know of my displeasure. I went to the H&R website and found no survey section, so I called there 1-800 line and asked the assistant on the line, he had no idea what I was talking about so he put me on hold. After returning, he said he knew of no such survey on line, so I asked for a manager and he informed me that the manager was unaware of any survey site either. So I said, this is why I will no longer use H&R block for any of my tax business and neither will the 35 members of my extended family now that they know my frustration. H&R Block post your prices like everyone else.
Filed 2010 return using H&R Block at Home (free) version. IRS said, they deposited my refund on 2/19/10. Later learned that the H&R software has a "glitch" that causes it to sometimes add or subtract digits from your banking information which causes the bank to deny the deposit. Then you have to call IRS, they tell you they will mail you your refund which takes 3-4 additional weeks. I learned from speaking with a local H&R rep that they were aware of the problem because they have had several returns that they have done that were sent back not deposited. Be careful - especially if you are in dire need of the money (like most of us)!
I started one of their “Free Edition” online tax returns, but at some point in the process, it switched me to their “Basic” version which has a $14.99 fee. There is no way to “switch back” so either I have to pay their fee, or find another online preparer. There's no warning, no disclaimer, no caution screen to tell you that you've left the Free Edition – nothing, until you get hit with the bill at the end and have no recourse.
After calling H&R Block to find out how much it would cost (around $68 or so) to get my family of 3's taxes done, we decided to set up an appointment. Since the cost was only going to be $68, I decided to have them do a second look for $30 on last year's taxes, which I had done on TurboTax online for free. She found $10. First waste of money. Now I know TurboTax is the right choice, but oh, am I not done! When she proceeded to put in our information for this year's taxes, we were excited when she showed us what our refund would be. Then she told us what we would be charged for today's services. Brace your self! $383! We had no idea that this was coming, and we have been struggling to pay our normal bills and are already behind on our mortgage. More now! This was a huge chunk of our refund! I paid on a credit card, so at least I'd have a few months to pay off this crazy number. The only things we had were day-care receipts and a mortgage statement. When my hubby called back yesterday to ask about this insane charge, he was told that the day-care form cost over $100, the mortgage form was around $80, and then there was the normal form. They told him that they have to pay the government for the forms (which is crap for we can all get them free at the library or plenty of other locations, like online), and so we have to pay part of it. I also did a phone survey yesterday, in which I reported our problem and gave them the lowest scores you can give. We told them that no one we know will ever come here, as well as no one they know, and so on. I come across a lot of people in my job, as does my husband, and we are spreading the word vehemently. I only wish someone had told me. When you call and they give you a price, so you decide to go there. Then they blow it up by 5x or so. I feel like I have been robbed and violated. No one in this economy can afford this. Donald Trump probably doesn't pay this much for his taxes! Now, no groceries for the month. We'll have to figure something out. I hate H&R Block! I can't afford to pay for basic life supplies, because H&R Block jacked our charges up so high. Ridiculous and should be illegal. If there are ever charges filed against them, I am there!
The free file program contains an error, which duplicates mortgage interest if you have a mortgage credit certificate! It carries over the mortgage from your 1098, and once you follow their directions for input, it doubles your mortgage amount on final return. It cost me $1,400 in penalties, and makes me look like a cheater! Now, I get to worry about the years following the one I was penalized for, because it did each year. It runs an error check for duplicate entries, but when you review, you won't find it, because you are following their directions, and you input what you are asked. It will come bite you a couple of years later. I want my money back! It cost me $1,400 on top of m,y taxes this year. I am in dire straights, as I am trying to maintain my mortgage after the death of my partner. I can look forward to more too, because I used this service for the last few years.
I went to H&R Block on 2/21/10 to have my taxes done. I have one W-2 and my two children under 15. I had nothing else to claim, no house, no nothing. They charged me $276. I was outraged. I am a single mother of two. If I had gone to my old tax preparer from when I was married, it would have been almost $150 cheaper. I am really outraged and think I should be reimbursed some of the funds.
H&R Block's "Peace of Mind" is a piece of crap. I'm too exhausted to go into details. But please keep this in mind that I was stupid enough to pay extra, so if the idiots made a mistake, I would be covered. Of course, they made a mistake, and it wasn't covered. In addition, this year, we paid extra to get the check in 8-15 days. However, the idiot who prepared our tax return switched my husband's to the primary social security number. And now 8 weeks later, IRS said that because they switched numbers, it held up our check. Aren't we paying these idiots to know this stuff? I want a refund for my express filing from H&R Block.
On Feb. 19th, my boyfriend and I went to see Cathy (office manager) to file our taxes. This is the 3rd year she has done our taxes. We are on her friends and families program. She did mine first, then Eddie's. We explained to her that he is a full-time student for 2 universities and he is on unemployment with the railroad. She tried to put through the Hope Credit, somehow it wasn't going through and then she took it off saying he didn't qualify because since it was paid through a loan and not paid by him. At the end, she said he was going to get back $660 even after all the deductions and being a full-time student. Before she sent it off, I even asked her why it was so low. She said because she couldn't apply the Hope Credit due to being a loan and he didn't get taxes taken out of the unemployment he was getting. Later that evening, my boyfriend looked it up and it states that as long as you're at least a half-time student, you get the Hope Credit. We were furious because not only did she not double check her work, but we even asked her before leaving the office about the return. She seemed to imply my boyfriend was trying to cheat the system that he was entitled to get. The next morning, Edwin called her office and the lady who answered said Cathy was with a client but offered assistance. He told her what happened and she also questioned him about being at least a half-time student. He told her yes and she looked over his return and saw the box wasn't checked for him being a student. His return changed from $660 to $2900. He asked if he needed to bring the proof again and she said yes. Cathy called him back saying it was changed and he didn't need to come in. She never apologized to him and her whole tone from our appointment and when she called back, was pompous and very disconcerting. I even tried to call District Managers Jennifer and Arnold and never got a call back. This situation is different from other complaints because if we hadn't double check, we would have been out of $2200 and a large corporation such as H&R Block to not just overlook mistake but was rude and implying that we were trying to cheat to get money that was owed to us. Thank you.
While using HR Block At Home Deluxe software for 2009, and while printing 1040 Forms for filing, I noticed that Interest items did not appear on Schedule B. (Dividends appeared, but not Interest). A statement on Schedule B states to "See Worksheets for Details". However, the Worksheets specify "Not for Filing".If I go to "Interest Summary" it will also not permit "Print for Filing". Therefore, I had to drag out my 60-year old Smith/Corona portable typewriter, buy new ink ribbon, and type in all Interest items on Schedule B by hand! I never encountered this problem with Turbo Tax, which I had used in prior years (and will continue to use in the future). I think that the HR Block software stinks, and that my purchase price should be refunded.
On 1/27/2010, I made and five minutes later, cancelled an online transaction in the amount of $183.38 and at H&R Block's request had the merchant, with whom I ordered, to fax them a letter of authorization to release funds (a first for me) back to my account with all required information included. That was over two weeks ago and every time I call, it's as if it is my first attempt. I have called 12 times with absolutely no avail. At this point, I consider my money stolen by H&R Block and plan to take legal action if not resolved. Help!
My girlfriend filed and had to pay $180 on a $1930 return and my mother-in-law paid $74 on a $1100 return. There seemed to be confusion on my returns so I had to consult my company before I filed. But for fun the accountant still went through the computer to see how much I would be getting back, just in case my returns were accurate. I was only suppose to get back $900 and only suppose to pay $80 tops. When I went back today to file I had another gentlemen do my taxes. The $900 was accurate; however, my cost jumped up to $130! I told him the other guy said it was only $80. He said he didn't have proof of that (since they saved my file). So I was a sucker and paid it but made sure to comment on my girlfriend’s amount vs. my amount to pay. He didn't have a real good answer and by this point I just wanted to leave. It took him 15 minutes just to get staples and fill his stapler! I will never go back to H&R Block and neither will my family. They just lost a total of 5 people and counting!
In February of 2009, I went in to HR Block like I had done for about ten years to file my 2008 taxes. My preparer's name was Rose **. I asked her if I could file married but separate because I had only been married to my husband for 5 months. She said and I quote "It's a little late for that." So I filed Married filing joint only to discover that my "new husband" had not filed in 2003, so they took all 4503 of my taxes for him. When I called IRS, they told me to file injured spouse. I went back down to HR Block to file the injured spouse. I waited 12 weeks to receive 686 dollars. I called the IRS yet again and was told that my husband got credit for 1 child and I got credit for 1 child after I told Rose that both children were mine and I was claiming both children on injured spouse. The IRS told me that I should go back and file Married but separate which is what I asked to do in the first place. I went back to HR Block and then dealt with the manager, Lee. I sat there for 2 hours while she prepared my amendment yet again. I then had to wait another 12 weeks only to receive a letter from the IRS stating I did not owe anything at this time. I called the IRS yet again to be told to write a letter explaining that I amended the return and the IRS needed to give me a refund. I waited another 12 weeks to be sent yet another letter saying that my amendment was denied because of the due date. I called the IRS again only to be told that I had to send them proof that I mailed my amendment by April 15th. I did that and waited about 8 weeks only to receive a letter asking me to fill out a 1040 x but before I had a chance to do that I was sent yet another letter from the IRS saying I owed them 4391 dollars from filing an amended single return. This time after calling the IRS, they instructed me to go to the IRS building on Granby street with all of my paper work which I did. The tax preparer told me that Lee never included my children or checked the box for my earned income credit so the IRS changed my filing status from married filing separate to single. In the mean time, I had already filed my 2009 return and the IRS took the $4391 from my refund. So the IRS preparer sent yet another amendment in and guess what? I have to wait another 12 weeks for the money they took from my 2009 return and any refund from 2008. It has been over a year and I am still waiting! I was moving to North Carolina and needed that money for the move. I had already given my real estate company the required 60 day notice to move and I now have to move in with my sister until I get the money from my return. I lost the house in North Carolina and when I do move, have to go through house hunting all over again.
I filed my kids' taxes using H&R Block free file and found the state of Delaware has an error in it. It says on the return that the deposit is going into an account outside of the United States even though I checked that it is not. I entered the bank account info but it did not show up on the return either. I have called 4 different times and no one has been able to correct the problem or return my calls. I still have not filed the state returns because I don't want any errors. Make sure you look at your return before you file it.
When I filed my taxes 2007 tax year, the man who prepared my taxes was a first time preparer so in 2008, I received something from IRS stating that I owe them 1,200 dollars. When I went to do my taxes 2009 at another H&R Block office, I showed them the document so the office manager whose name was Victor ** had me sign a power of attorney and declaration of representative stating that they would take care of this problem. Now 2010 is here and I have to file taxes for the 2009 year. IRS keeps my refund stating that I owe them money and this was supposed to be taken care of through H&R Block.
I went to file my taxes with H&R Block on February 3, 2010. I chose to get my refund in 15 days. Well, today is day 15, and still no refund. For whatever reason, H&R Block thought it was acceptable to use my National City account number, with my PNC Bank routing number (National City in no longer in existence). I have a problem paying for a service I did not receive, and when I asked for answers, I got the run-around. The lady I spoke with would not call, did not even want to give my Household Bank's telephone number. She acted like there was a problem because I was inquiring about my money. I paid for a service I did not receive, and I have urgent car repairs that need to be made. I am trying to start my court reporting career, and I need this money to finance my equipment.
I went to H&R Block on Feb. 2nd 2010 and filed my returns electronically. My refund promised to be deposited into my bank account on Feb. 12th. The day came and went, today being the 13th, and there was still no refund. I was charged their typical fee of $30.00, yet the monies were not deposited. I called both H&R Block, as well as their bank HSBC, and of course, they each blamed the other. When calling HSBC, they stated on the recording, (the only way you can get information, no people work there?) it had been released to my bank the 12th. It is not my bank at fault. These are lies within H&R Block and their HSBC bank. They should be made to refund anyone who paid that $30 and did not get their refund as promised! I will not be going back to H&R Block again! They steal from people legally, and as I called my bank and others in regards to this, I found that I was not alone in the boat. Many are having this same problem calling our bank and H&R Block as well according to my bank and H&R Block. Of course, H&R Block takes no responsibility even though it's their bank, trying to point fingers at mine as the problem. Not! A little like having the vampire in charge of the blood bank, isn't it? How can you call them to task on this? There has to be some protection for people out there. I and my family had a financial hardship due to this.
I've been filing at H&R block for the past couple of years, but this year I was not happy at all with my scheduled appointment that was at 6:30pm and I wasn't seen until 7:45pm. I asked the women helping me before we began if the price for filing rise more from last year. I felt she was not being honest because if she knew I will be paying more, she should have told me. I payed over $350 and still no refund basically thirteen days later where she said my refund will be here for sure February 10th. H&R block charged me over $100 for each proof of tax document. This is my last year doing my tax return with them; they lost a valued customer. I am behind in bills because I was counting on my return to have come. My car cannot get fixed now and I'm late for school everyday because I have to get my son settled.
I've been using this program for over twenty years. In 2008, I had a return that required a taxable K-1 from a Contingent Trust. I received the contingent trust fiduciary report from my accountant (Form 1041) and entered the information in the appropriate place on the H and R Block tax form. This information was and is on this Taxcut form and also the work sheet. The final return however did not reflect that this information was used to show a taxable K-i from the contingent trust in 2008. Consequently, the amount was not included on my return nor was the proper tax paid. Being under stress from head trauma received earlier in the year, I was not too sharp in detecting I had a problem. I have not heard from the IRS as yet but I'm sure I will. This will cost my estate several hundred thousands. In reviewing online, I have found many sites describing the problems caused people in this country by this company. Being almost eighty and in poor health, I don't feel I'm going to see the end of this myself but I'm greatly concerned about my children and the impact that this will have on them. God help us.
I did my taxes through H&R Block Home Free edition. I have done this for three years with no trouble. I had no problems filing but could not print a copy of my return. The IRS accepted my return. I got my refund promptly. Here I am 7+ hours of my time later, five resolution numbers (we will contact you within 24-48 hours-which were escalated). I have not had any return calls and the problem has not been resolved. I was told on 2/8 I would be able to print on 2/10, nothing happened. All of my resolution numbers have been closed. I called again today and was given number 5. I have been hung up on three times in the past month. I've been told to go to the IRS website and request a copy which will only cost you $57 to obtain.
On February 9, 2010, my husband and I both had the day off and were going to file our taxes. We chose H&R Block this year over Jackson Hewitt because I had some family members who advised me that they were so wonderful! They were wrong. Upon entering the location, we were met by a very pushy, demanding woman. We waited for a tax preparer to become available. We were quickly greeted by a young woman, who was very kind and willing to help. I have no problem with her. Her only downfall is, perhaps, she is not quite as experienced as she should be. She had the woman who originally greeted us at the door to help her out. By the time all information was in, my husband and I were only getting a refund of approximately $200. We were shocked, and were expecting so much more. Both women could tell we were distraught with that, and we advised them that we would go to Jackson Hewitt, get a print out of last year's taxes and then we could see what the difference was since we had not done anything different than the previous year. We come back to H&R Block with the copy from JH. The older woman reviews it, and quickly decides that the reason our refund is lower is due to having higher incomes this year. Again, we are still not satisfied. There is approximately $400 taken out of our checks every two weeks. That is $400 that would be very useful to us, in paying bills. The older woman took us back again, to try and help us to get our refund to where we would be happy with the result. We knew it was wrong! The younger woman gets on the computer and is inputting information into our tax preparation, only because the older woman is barking at her, "Put this # in, put that # in." And I'm just sitting there the whole time, wondering what in the world she is doing. By the time she is done barking orders, she turns the computer to my husband and I and tells us to look. She points at the refund amount now, which shows approximately $2600. My husband asks, "How did you do that?" That is when she looked at me and said, "I put on there that you are doing online classes to further your education." She even put on there that my commute was 700 miles. I don't think anyone would travel 700 miles to take online classes! She looked so proud of herself, so sure that my husband and I were frauds and would take her offer, her forgery. She counted on us wrong. I looked straight at her and said "But I don't take online classes. I don't care if we get $0 back, I will not lie on this." My husband backed me up and advised her to shred all documents that we might have signed before the preparation, that we were jumping ship and going back to Jackson Hewitt. She tried to get us to stay, even stating that JH would end up charging us too much. As it turns out, if we had believed that all we were getting back was $200, then we would have had to end up paying back into the IRS because our charge for the tax preparation would have been more than our refund! I walked out of the business while my husband got a business card to the location, and after we left, he called the young woman who was originally helping us. He took a leap and advised her to try and find another job before this older woman ended up getting her fired. My husband and I did go back to Jackson Hewitt and they input our information, honestly. We were going to get $1600, but they realized we made a mistake on our student loan section. We thought it asked how much a year we pay on student loans, so we stated over $2500, but the questions was 'percentage'. So our $1600 got knocked down to $1300, but I am happy with the result. My husband and I put great emphasis on integrity and honesty, and this lady at H&R Block did not have an ounce of integrity. She told us she had a couple before who was in the same situation as us, and she ended up getting them back about $2600 as well. So, there is no telling how many tax forms she has filled out fraudulently! My husband and I are going to take what steps are necessary to see that this woman loses her job. She will only be contributing to citizens being audited by the IRS, and more than likely being fined for this forged information later on! I don't doubt there are many individuals who are great at this job, who are honest, but my complaint with H&R block is that they should monitor very closely the activities going on in each branch.
I have filed my taxes with H&R Block for the past 3 years. This year, I have chosen not to do so. In order to complete my tax returns, I need my prior year return. However, H&R Block has all but refused to provide them to me in the following manner: I was told that I would have to pay H&R Block to do my taxes this year in order to access my prior year. Then I was told that my records are available online if I consent to have them do my returns this year. Then I was told that the online system containing prior year returns was down for maintenance. Then I was told that my prior year returns would be available on a certain day. I was told that my prior year returns would be available in 9 days. Then I was told that if I want my prior year returns that I need to contact the IRS. Then I was told they will try to have my prior year returns sent to a local branch within the next 48 hours. This has been going on for over a week. In my first 4 attempts to contact someone from customer service, our conversation was disconnected. At no point did were any of those issues disconnected conversations followed up on. Therefore, I have then had to go through the entire scenario all over again each time. First of all, I paid H&R Block to have my taxes done. I should not have to pay the IRS a fee of $57 for something that I have already paid for. I am not asking for any service but simply a copy of the services that H&R Block provided to me already. Secondly, the nature in which they have approached this issue seems to be bordering on blackmail like they will give me my prior year returns if I pay them to do my taxes this year. Also, I find it to be highly irresponsible for a tax services firm to be doing maintenance on their tax system in the middle of tax season.
I was supposed to get a two day refund on my tax returns, but an inept tax associate who had done them messed up and had done a practice form first. Then when he finally did the right form he mixed the people and the social security numbers up. I did not find out from them but by calling the H&R Block 800-number, I found out that there were mistakes because of that. Therefore, I didn't receive my two-day refund which made me receive my refund at a much later date. He said that I could get a two-day refund that he knew wasn't possible and then charging me for the rapid refund which I did not receive. I went back to the same location and found out that I was still being charged for the two-day refund. Since I did not get the rapid refund as promised I asked to get the H&R Block fees back so I could take my taxes elsewhere to get them filed. Then in order to be able to keep me as a future customer they said that they talked to the Franchise Manager of that particular branch and she said that they would refund me all the fees except for $29 for filing them. I was supposed to get the money within two or three business days, and never did. It has now been almost two weeks now and no money yet. They have been giving me the run around saying that they already mailed it and to just keep waiting. I know it doesn't take mail that long to get from Big Stone Gap, VA to Dryden, VA which is not hardly eleven miles away. I should have defiantly gotten it by now. I am still waiting. They are not the professionals that they claim to be! I have used up a lot of gas money running back and forth trying to get this mess settled. I also wasted a lot of time on the phone with them as well. I thought that I was going to get my rapid refund back in time. So, I went and scheduled my truck driving classes that I have to pay for upfront for within time of the two-day refund, so I could pay for the classes with my rapid refund. Then I found out I wasn't receiving the rapid refund as promised and had to cancel my classes until the future for whenever I do actually get my refund back. They have delayed my career training because they aren't professionals.
We received a $25 off coupon in the mail for Tax Prep w/H&R. We have always gone to H&R and thought how nice to give customers a little break! How wrong we were, upon giving the coupon at our Appt. to deduct off our $196 bill, it was stated that they don't take coupons at our location because we are too small a town! Why would H&R mail out such a thing to areas that will not accept it unless it is a way of luring in customers? Shame on H& Block! We won't be falling for that again!
Ok, so me and my wife are filing jointly this year and on the first day of the military, getting our W-2s, I go in and get my taxes done. I'm thinking, hey my mom and dad have used them for a few years, we will give it a try. I could have gotten this done on post for next to nothing but me and my wife really needed our return. I filed on the 20th of January. It's now the 7th of February, what happened to the supposed 8-15 days and my taxes will be in. And to top it off, I got a text saying my money was deposited and there was nothing in my account. I called H & R Block. They said they don't do emails. 2 hrs later, my best friend who also filed there, got the same email from them. It's now 4 days after they said they deposited the money into my account. Where did my money go? HSBC sent me to some dumb automated site that was no help. My bank says the money isn't there and the people working at the tax place "well the ones we worked with" seemed very incompetent. Where did my money go, and why did I pay $200 to have it done quickly when it really wasn't done that quickly? Late on the tax return, bills due, no money. no confidence in this company whatsoever. Next time, I'm getting this done on post "for free". It's faster and the money gets there in "5" days.
Due to a mistake on the part of H&R Block, I was denied my entire refund this year. H&R Block screwed up on my taxes, according to the IRS. I tried to inform my tax preparer, who is supposed to know what she is doing. She said she would look into the matter, and has since stopped answering my calls. I figure this is because she is aware to the fact that her daughter is the one who made the mistake on our taxes in 2007. This mistake is now going to cost me $4,383.45 to the IRS. Of course H&R Block has a guarantee for this problem, and promises to fix any such matter that occurs by their preparers. Unfortunately, I guess that they have forgotten of this promise. This could not have happened at a worse time. I have been out of work for a year, and was counting on this money to pay for some bills. Thanks H&R Block. I'll make sure that I will warn as many as possible to stay away.
I am originally from Newark, Ohio and have done my taxes with H & R Block for several years now, at least 10. I used the same office and the same tax preparer from 2002 until the 2009 season. Back in 2005, I began receiving letters in the mail from the IRS saying that I had not paid the school taxes that I had owed. I kept getting the run around with them trying to figure it out, and every year that I went back to H & R Block, Debbie, the tax preparer kept saying she was taking care of it and it would no longer be a problem. Then the year the government started the stimulus payments. I only received a partial payment. I also only received a partial payment for my federal tax refund for 2008. I finally got to the bottom of what was going on with my school taxes. Debbie was entering in on her computer when she was preparing my taxes, that I lived in the Licking Valley School District instead of the Heath school district (which does not have school taxes). There is only a difference by one number, the last digit. The school district they claimed I lived within actually started about 1/8th of a mile, approx 4 houses up the road from my house. My kids even attended Heath city schools. Where the Valley district started is where the road I lived on went from being just rural to more country. As of the 2008 tax season, the IRS had offset and kept approximately $1400 of my money that should have came to me, with the stimulus payment and federal returns. I attempted to get H & R Block to correct the problem and retrieve my money since I always paid the extra $30 piece of mind guarantee. They wouldn't do it, claiming that my address automatically kicks up the Valley district instead of Heath. But the thing is, everyone in that area knows where the districts stop and start. I have informed Debbie from the get go that my kids went to Heath City Schools, not Valley. She never gave me a school income tax return or form to sign and mail in myself for Valley and when their computers automatically kick in something like that, they most generally have the option to change it if need be. The really bad thing was, I lived in a set of country town-homes on t he outskirts of town within Heath city limits. My mailing address was in Heath and Debbie was my neighbor in the same town- home complex! Which is how I knew her and why I began going to her in the first place. So the IRS tells me I have to gather several pieces of documentation, including statements from the property manager stating that I lived there and the dates, letters from the Heath schools my kids had attended and the dates and letters from all the utility companies I used while I lived there. I was told by the IRS that if I could provide all that information, even just fax it directly to the person I spoke to, that within 6-8 weeks I would receive all the money that they had kept from me over those few years, with interest, totaling around $3000. So I spent several days, a few weeks gathering and getting all this. I faxed it all as asked, and guess what, 10 weeks later, no response. Spoke to the same person that had told me to do this, and they had no record of ever receiving any of it. Well, I had been smart enough to keep copies of all of it, so this time I faxed and mailed it all in. Another 3 months go by, no response. This time they are saying I did not send in all of it and it went to the wrong department. When I went crazy and threatened with a lawyer, they claimed that they could not use any of the information because it was dated more than 30 days prior, so I needed to retrace and do it all over again! Then this year I move to Bellaire. Went back to H & R Block, different office. The preparer, Elizabeth screwed up two of my kids' SS #'s, flipping them around. So when the IRS received my return, they rejected it claiming the numbers were not matching up to prior years. Elizabeth called me the next morning to tell me it had been rejected and acted as if I had handed her false social security cards the day I had my taxes done with my husband. When I point out her error, she stumbles on her words and says she will correct it right away and resubmit it. We had applied for the RAL 1-2 day loan. The day we prepared our taxes, we received almost $900 or of $8000 refund and was supposed to get the rest within 1-2 days. After she corrected the problem, the IRS accepted the return, but then the bank denied the rest of the RAL because of the "offset" from all them previous years' error from Heath with the school district thing. So I paid $406 in all the H & R Block filing fees and RAL fees and interest to the H & R Block bank, but still have to wait (so they say) 8-15 days until I get my return (Feb 12th). But the website for the IRS says that I will get it around Feb 16th if there are no mistakes and if we don't owe any other taxes. So since the RAL was denied due to the offset, taxes owed, will I really get it between the 12th & 16th or after they take what they say I owe again (another $1200 with interest and penalties) will I have to wait several weeks, and be the last to receive my refund? I am done with H & R Block. I plan on getting back all that money this year that they have kept, come hell or high water and from now on I am doing my own taxes with Turbo Tax.
I went to H&R Block today to get my taxes done. I usually do them myself but I decided to have them done since they were advertising a rate of only $69.98. I figured if they help me out, at all its worth, the few extra dollars it costs over doing them myself. I sat down with a representative for over an hour. When my taxes were done, I was told that it was going to cost $258.00 instead of the advertised $69. When I inquired why the over three hundred percent markup, I was told, "Your taxes are very complicated because you earned savings account interest and you paid student loan interest." I told her that I’m not paying and I walked out. The stuff that made my taxes "complicated" took less then five minutes for her to input.
I filed my 2009 taxes with H&R Block on the 18th of January. The IRS accepted my return. The money was deposited into H&R Block's bank account on the 25th for which I got an email from H&R Block telling me that my money is in their account and I will get it in 2 to 3 days. So 8 days later, I called them back, and they told me I will get it the next day. So the next day came around, and nothing. Still to this day, I have nothing. I used H&R Block, because on their ads they state they're the fastest in getting you your return. But by far, they are the slowest. My roommate filed hers on the 22nd and got it 5 days later. I have been waiting for 16 days now. I need the money, because my rent is due and my car broke down and I need to get it fixed. I work in retail, so I don't make much money at all.
I went to H&R Block online to do my federal taxes. I have done my taxes online with them for the past few years. My taxes are fairly easy, so I chose the H&R Block at home free edition federal tax return. A pop up appeared stating that I could upgrade to basic for a fee and they would import last year's information to make the process easier and minimize data entry errors. I bypassed the basic option, I was 95% done when it asks me to input my 2008 AGI and PIN. Previously, I have been able to see my previous year's tax returns that I have completed; this year, I can't. I did not print a copy of my cover sheet when I did my taxes last year, as I thought it would be easily accessible as in years past. The H&R website states the following: To print a previous year return, please follow the directions below: Log in to H&R Block At Home Online. On the Main Menu under My Account, locate the Download/Print Previous Returns section. Click the link for the return you need. For example, to print your 2008 return, click Filing Year 2008. When I do this, I only have the option to Download/Print my 2009 return. Another disclaimer: If you don't see View Prior Year Returns or any tax year links on the Main Menu, either you didn't use the correct username and password to access your prior year return or you didn't complete and pay for that tax return using one of H&R Block's online programs. I have the e-mailed receipt showing payment for my 2008 tax return with H&R Block Online. This is very frustrating to me. I was thinking of giving in and just refiling with the basic and paying the fee, so the previous AGI and PIN would be imported. But when I log in, it just automatically reverts me back to my saved information. Free filers, beware...or just make sure you have all your information from 2008.
I have been filing with H&R Block using their free federal service for several years now with no problems. This year they updated their system with the new H&R Block At Home to file online. This system is dirty in every way possible. They have a tiered pricing system with it starting from free and going up to I think $99. I chose free as I have done every year and when I clicked 'start' to start my return, it switched me to the basic plan (costs money). I found this very odd and looked for a way to switch back to the free service without any luck. I call H&R and spoke with a very friendly rep. She continued to repeat that I did something to make the system believe I did not qualify for the free service. This leads me to believe that free only works if you don't actually plan on filing with them. Again, all I did was hit the start button to start my taxes. She then proceeded to tell me that there was no way to switch my account down to the free version once I've signed up for an upgraded package. I was able to maintain my composure, but I am shocked at how ludicrous this claim is! I would be able to use the free again if I created a new account. I have used my account for a while now and it has my previous years tax returns on it. At this point I lost all interest in working with H&R Block. I asked the lady how I could access my previous years returns and her reply was that the system that has all of our previous information is "down". I asked for more information and she could not give me any. I found this ironic as I went to the site and was able to import my taxes. The lady herself was very kind but H&R Block will never have my business again.
My husband and I have used this service for many years. I was unsure about doing my own taxes, so I called H and R Block to see how much the fees would be because our income has decreased and we only had one deduction. The man who answered told me it would be between $68 and no more than $100. I told him I had a W2 and one from my unemployment and my husbands disability. He told me that price. After signing papers and going through the process, we were charged over $200 dollars that was almost all of our return. I feel very mislead. We knew we would not get much back, but this is really unfair. Not sure what can be done. Thought I would use their website on their brochure but I can't find it. Hope you can help or at least warn people. Apparently you get charged for every piece of paper and deductible.
My husband and I went in to get our taxes done, which we have done every year without a problem. Well, this last tax year (2009), my brother stayed with us for 7 months of the year and didn't work or provide anything to the house. I also didn't work, but my husband and I always file MFJ (married filing jointly). Well, the preparer said that we were not able to claim him as he is not a relative listed in their "drop-down" menu of allowable dependents who can live with you part of the year. She stated that he would have had to live with us the entire year, as he is not on their list as qualifying relatives for only part of the year. My husband and I took her at her word and were prepared to let it lie, until my mom called me and said she was looking on the IRS's own site and it states in publication 501 page 17 that a qualifying relative is a brother-in-law, sister-in-law, and so on. So, he is a qualifying relative of my husband and did not have to be with us the entire year. Now, we are having trouble telling them this, and they are fighting it, saying he cannot be claimed. However, I spoke to the IRS, and the man I spoke to stated that I was right in my assumption and that in the drop-down menu, they should have claimed him as a brother because publication 501 page 17 states that he can be a brother-in-law as a relative and only be with us a little more than 6 months (He was here for 7.). And just because I didn't work doesn't mean that I can't claim him, as we are MFJ on the return. Now she is arguing with me, saying that we can't claim him, because he wasn't here the whole year, and this office has said they will do an amended return but cannot give us our $193 back because it's "already in the system." My husband and I just want them to do the amended return and pay back the $193 when we get our return. (We did the "pay with taxes option," and we just want that money put on with the taxes we were already going to get.) We have come on some very hard times, and this just makes it that much worse. They have a "no-mistake guarantee" for crying out loud, and this is a huge mistake that nearly cost us $500! Needless to say, my husband and I will not be using them again. This H&R office nearly cost us an extra $500 plus the fact that they won't pay us back for mistakes they have made(!) or will cost us, as we haven't fixed it with them yet. I just wanted to warn people.
I compared the NJ State Tax portion of H&R Block 2009 Software to the online Turbo Tax version and discovered a discrepancy. The H&R Block software did not recognize overpayments of Box 14 entries on the W-2s, resulting in $25.00 less of a refund. The Turbo Tax software found the overpayment. Tech support from H&R Block told me to return the software to where I bought it for a refund.
Like everyone else, I paid a certain fee for a certain service and have not received my check yet. I feel like because I didn't receive my check in 1-2 days like they said, I should get some of my money back for the fees I paid.
I have been using the H&R Block free tax filing service for three years now. I think it's a great service. You do have to be careful about the options you choose or you will be charged. The free filing only applies to e-file on your federal return. Certain income and age requirements apply. If you don't use the correct link, stating that you meet the requirements, the free filing can direct you to basic filing which will cost you. It is a hassle if you accidentally direct yourself to a service you have to pay for, but overall it works out. If any charges come up, I just start over using a different link. The best way to start is to get the link directly from the IRS.gov page that lists free services. State taxes are never free and other services are offered for an additional fee.
I filed my 2008 tax return at H&R Block. I had a statement reporting roughly $3,000 in child care (for my 4 year old daughter) that I had paid to a Lutheran School. As she was doing my taxes, Amy **, my tax "professional" notified me that I could not claim this expense anywhere on my taxes because it was pre-school and not daycare. I was sure she was wrong, but she insisted and refused to include this credit on my taxes. She convinced me that it would be illegal and she would lose her job if she added this expense to my return. I was upset, but Amy and the store manager both explained over and over again that they could not do this. I should have walked out with my paperwork, but I didn't want to be rude, so I allowed her to e-file my return that same day. When I got home, I called another H&R Block in the area and asked about my childcare expenses. The woman at the other Schaumburg location told me that indeed, the expenses should have been claimed on my return, and that I could come in after April 15th to file an amended return. I knew that H&R Block was promoting that "your taxes will done right the first time or your filing fees are free. "I was planning to go forward with a refund claim once my amended return was completed so that I could prove that they did, in fact, make a mistake the first time. Surprisingly, Amy called me the next day to tell me that she did, indeed, make a mistake with the child care expenses, and that she would file an amended return for me after April 15th. (They couldn't bother fixing this problem during their busy season). When I mentioned to Amy that I intended to get my $193 in filing fees returned to me, she told me that she would have a manager give me a call. Well, guess what, a manager never called me, and every time I called to speak to Amy or a manager, for the next three months, no one would accept my calls. I tried calling customer service and any other number I could find, but there seems to be no one in charge. Apparently, all locations are independent from one another. Finally, after about 50 different phone numbers, and 10 hours of hold time, I was able to get the number for a "regional manager." This manager told me she wold "look into it" and give me a call back, but even she wouldn't return my call once she realized that I was looking for a refund. I eventually gave up and just paid an independent accountant to amend my taxes. In July, I received an additional $960 from the IRS. Basically, H&R Block's "money back guarantee" is a lie. They do not issue refunds for filing fees when they make mistakes. Heck, they will not even fix their own mistakes. Stay away from these scam artists! I had to pay an independent accountant $60.00 to amend my tax return when H&R Block would not return my calls. Additionally, I paid $193 dollars for a tax return done improperly.
My sister took it upon herself to use my children's social security numbers when she filed her income tax in 2008. This was done without my permission to her. No one contacted me. I found out when I filed my income tax that my kids numbers had already been used. I ended up owing the IRS 1300 plus from this transaction. My sister called me after she has used one of my kids social security numbers this year. Now the IRS is keeping my miniscule income tax this year to offset last years amount. Why is it possible for people, be they family or not be permitted to use another person's children's social security numbers with not so much as a courtesy call to the parent? Suppose this same scenario had taken place from a complete stranger. Yes, my kids do stay with her for convenience where they go to school. However, I still there should be some sort of notification process from the HR Block Offices as well as the IRS when someone is using social security numbers that belong to someone else. My sister should have asked me. HR Block should have contacted me as well as the IRS. I was counting on this small refund to tide me over until my next pay day. I don't even have gas money to get to work. The lack of coordination/communication involved in this matter is unacceptable.
I just saw an ad on line for free filling with H&R Block, but when I created an account it asked me to pay a fee of $14.95. What a joke! Then I wanted to talk to a real person online and it gave me automated messages! I wanted to know if they would be asking me for my credit card next, but I didn't go that far. I have used H&R Block for years (in person) but this online system is a joke!
I used H&R Block to prepare our 2008 tax returns. Not only did we pay over 100 dollars for basic return, we are military as well. I went to pick up our return after it was printed out and placed it in their usual envelope. I should have looked inside but I never would have thought this. These people gave me someone else's tax return. I am sitting here with this poor man's SS#, Bank routing and account number and everything. And the worst thing is someone has ours as well. These are our most personal things and we can't just change SS#'s now, can we? We are very very upset. On top of it, after I called and reported it and asked for a copy of our 2008 return because we need it to file for this year, they want to charge us $20 for the copy and also we have to wait 5 days just to talk to someone (district manager) about the issue to get it straight. I am beyond upset now. My husband is in Iraq right now and I have not been able to tell him the issue. But I am looking for who I can report this too because someone is out there with our personal information. We will never ever use them again and I am also reporting them to the US Military services because if this is how they do business, I think they should be on the cannot do business with list for sure. This is dangerous. This is massive stress that someone could have my bank account information and my SS# as well as my husband's. I'm under stress of not being able to go ahead and file our return and stress of having to wait for a call back. This is unacceptable service.
Peace of mind only if you pay for it. If you take your taxes to H&R Block and do not pay the additional $30 for peace of mind, in addition to the fee for having your taxes prepared you are setting yourself up for potential backlash. Reputable professional service must be paid for twice at H&R Block. This does not leave consumers with a peace of mind but as vulnerable consumers that are a year away from having the IRS knock on their door for money because a professional that you paid for made a mistake on your taxes. Unfortunately, I can attest to this firsthand. H&R Block's purpose is not a state of the art tax preparation experience for everyone. I took my December 2008 paycheck studs to the Maryland City Location H&R Block Location and because the preparer used the 2007 W-2s, I now owe $5,000 plus to the IRS. I no longer have peace of mind dealing with H&R Block. As a consumer, during tax season you are at the hands of fictitious professionals, if a physician makes a mistake, there is malpractice insurance involved. At H&R Block, if you do not pay an additional fee for mistakes made by the preparer, mistakes are not covered. I tried contacting individuals to assist me at H&R Block to no avail. I was told by one employer at H&R Block in the Columbia Mall, an obvious mistake was made by the preparer, however, since you did not purchase the peace of mind, this will be a costly mistake for you. H&R Block states their values encompass client focus, responsibility, teamwork, integrity and respect. How regrettable, I will never refer another person to H&R Block nor will I ever look to them as professionals in the tax industry. Did I mention I have used H&R Block for 20 years?
If you have bad credit and file your taxes at H&R Block, do not choose to get your tax return money in 2 days or less. You will not qualify even if they tell you "no problem, you'll qualify." I waited 2 days and did not get my money. I immediately researched online and found a mountain of complaints. I called H&R Block and found out that I too was denied and now have to wait the normal 8-15 days. Turbo Tax is free and I wish I would have just gone that route. If I had, I would have saved $260 and the fee for the 2-day return advance. If you've already filed with H&R Block with the 2-day pay service, don't bother trying to cancel. You'll still have to pay H&R Block for their service. It's a drag. I wish I would have found this site before then. That's a lesson learned. It's the bank guaranteeing your loan for the tax return who denies you which has nothing to do with H&R Block. However, they could be more up front especially when I told the woman who helped me that I had bad credit and wouldn't qualify. She guaranteed me after everything was complete a check in 2 days. Other than this major snafu, she was great and thorough and their customer service in responding to my questions was excellent, including the supervisor who called me back when I had questions about cancelling. Then I learned how much of a hassle it was going to be to cancel and decided and take the loss rather than tie up my money for a much longer time because the lender has to wait for your IRS check, then return it and then the IRS has to cut you a new check. I over paid on filing my taxes for a quick return on my check. It's not happening like that.
My mother and stepdad are both deaf and went to H&R Block to have their 2009 Tax Returns done. My mother paid over $300 in fees to get her money back on January 19,2010. They went down there to get it and H&R Block made an error on their refund by putting the last digit of her SSN# down wrong. She paid $30 for peace of mind (POM) which I read it covers up to $5,000 in taxes if H&R made an error and she owes the IRS. What about the POM for them getting it right? On top of it, she has been in and out of the hospital. Stepdad had back surgery just a month ago and their power is cut off because they couldn't pay it and they are having to stay with me. They had made a deal with the power company to pay by the 19th. I would not recommend using H&R Block. They were told they might get it by Jan. 22, 2010. Who knows if they will or not.
I went in and filled out my 2009 income taxes. Linda *** then told me after a series of mess ups my refund would arrive on 1/19/2010. It is now the 20th and I have been told my loan was denied. I have done Rapid refund and instant refunds for 20 years and now this. When I called, all I got was *** at the bank and H&R Block headquarters. What next? I had to pay $231 for them to give me my money in 8-15 days. I could have efiled myself and got it back in seven.
Okay, there needs to be a lawsuit filed against these two companies for their misleading and false information and "flat out lies!" My husband and I have always used H&R Block except for last year. We used the Free IRS eFile on the government website. That return was received in about 7-10 days. Best thing is it was free! We filed on January 14, 2010. We were as always approved for rapid refund or a RAL and of course the emerald card. We chose the emerald card (my refund was over $9,000) and we only chose it because it was "the fastest way to receive your refund" and is $20 cheaper than your paper check. However, if you add up all the money, you lose to access an ATM and those bank charges, you will lose a lot of money, much more than $20 when all you had to do was get a paper check and deposit it into your bank account! Anyways, my refund was supposed to be accessible on this emerald card no later than MLK day! Nope! I was not there today either. I started making calls and heard that we had been denied by HSBC bank. We use this HSBC bank every single year except for last year. My husband has a FICA score of 744 (woo hoo). Mine is around 680, give or take. So credit score was not the issue. We still do not know what the issue is. I know that when I called H&R Block, I could not get a direct answer except for this, "You have been declined. We cannot tell you why because it is not our SS number!" So what did we pay the $29 in extra fees for? Peace of mind. Seeing how they do not know anything and cannot tell us anything. This is most certainly a rip off. They are stealing our money. Hey, the economy is bad. If they cannot give loans then they need to stop advertising that they can. I did not desperately need my return in a two day period. I was however using the money to pay my deductible on my 9 year old daughter's braces. I think it should be illegal at the way they are going about getting their money, H&R Block as well. Some people could have used that extra $250 that was paid to H&R Block to buy food or pay a car payment or house payment, maybe got themselves a little caught up on bills and filed their taxes for free, free, free, free online and got their return in the same exact amount of time! Now my return will still be added to this *** emerald card that I do not need and I will still have to pay an arm and a leg to have all my refund transferred to my bank account.
In 2006 and 2007 we used the H&R Block online tax program. But we just received a letter from the IRS that our 2007 refund was more than we should have been refunded. The amount of our refund was $16,468.00 when it should have been $1,533.00. The IRS letter states we owe back $14,935 plus interest totaling $15,980. We have been approved to make payments to the IRS to repay the amount owed. After we looked over our return and all of our documents, we came to the conclusion the software program added my military retirement income in both wages and tax withholding. We did rework (started over) our return at the time 2-3 times with the same result. It wasn't our normal return amount but we used the H&R Block program to rework our return. And since we did have $10,000 more in interest than 2006 due to a refinance loan, we didn't really think anything different. We now owe back to the IRS $15,980 at $450.00 per month for 24 months plus interest until the debt is paid. This was the money for our retirement plan. The local H&R Block office isn't being very helpful to correct the problem. Thank you for your time.
H&R Block improperly advised me to pay a tax penalty which they failed to investigate as to whether or not it was in fact owed by me. Additionally, H&R Block failed to properly support me regarding an IRS audit of the 2007 income tax return which they prepared. Errors were made by H&R Block, and admitted in an email. H&R Block sold me the "peace of mind" extended service plan in 2007 to assist me in case of an audit. However, they have violated their agreement to support and represent me. I've spent endless hours writing back and forth, and calling H&R Block, to get them to assist in handling the audit. H&R Block is stating that I am financially responsible for overt deduction that's disallowed in the audit, despite the fact that if it's disallowed to their mistake!
I have watched commercials saying come in early and get your taxes done, that they could get our W-2's so we can get our money faster. Well, I took my own W-2 in on January 7 and had my taxes done and chose the 1-2 days. After it was done, I asked when I could expect my money and was told that the IRS wouldn’t release any money until the 15th. I even called back later to check on the date again and was told the same thing. I called this morning and was told that they just started to accept them and that it would be 1-2 days after they accepted it. Then I called the main office and was told something different, that they wouldn’t release the money until the 19th. This is false advertising because even if you file early, you don’t get your money until several weeks later. Now the only reason I even filed early was so that I could get my money and take care of some bills and get my medicine, so instead of getting my money today or tomorrow like I should, I probably won’t see it until Wednesday or Thursday. No real damage except for the fact of going without my medicine because they lied.
I've had my taxes done at the above location five times by the above noted preparer. The IRS reviewed my 2004 and 2006 returns and said they needed to review my receipts, mileage log and proof that I actually worked in the cities that I claimed deductions in. The above noted tax preparer gave me a list of everything the IRS wanted, and I, in turn, gave my tax preparer all of the items. He turned it into the IRS and the IRS still denied my deductions even though I gave them everything they asked for! HR Block then submitted the claim to their Peace of Mind office and they, as well, denied the claim. All of the deductions are legitimate. In fact, the preparer had me take more deductions then I normally took. The preparer saw all of my documentation, receipts, logs and was more than content with my documentation. Keep in mind that this has been going on for almost three years (March 2007), and I don't know who I should go after. Do I go after HR Block or try to deal with the IRS? I need someone who knows what to do in this situation. I've already paid about $10,000 dollars; which is a lot of money to me. I've been worrying about this for years. I received my first letter in March of 2007 and as stated, I have paid about $10,000 dollars and am not done yet! I am so overwhelmed when I think about this that I sometimes can't sleep at night, which affects me at work.
I went to H&R Block to have my 2008 taxes done. I told the preparer, Antonio **, that I live with my girlfriend and her two children, and financially support them. I asked Antonio ** if I could claim them as dependents since they receive no support from their father. He said I could and so I claimed them as dependents. I received $5,783.00, my refund from the federal taxes. I received $1,563.51 from the state, but I have not heard from them yet. I received a letter in June from the IRS saying I would have to repay all my refund because the preparer checked the box that said I was their father. I never told him that. I said dependents. I went to the district office. I talked to Thomas ** and he told me that I did not buy their insurance, so therefore they would not do anything except refile with the correct box checked. I am looking for an attorney to help me sue H&R Block, make them pay the interest and the money I owe. I did not make this mistake. They did.
I went to get a loan on the Emerald Advance. They don't tell you up front that if you are laid off, you cannot receive a loan. So they put it in the computer and I got denied. So they said my wife can do it, so she went over there and they told her she couldn't because she made under $10,000. And now they messed us up because I started back to work. Now they said they can't put it back through because they ran it the first time and I was denied because of the lay off. They should tell you this because you may be going back to work the next day and not even know that if you did. I would have waited to get called to a job before I applied. What can I do now? I needed the loan.
Last year we were able to get the Emerald card. We went in today, 12/08/09 at 10:00am and we sat there for an hour. When we saw John, he asked if we had our check stubs. I said, “Yes, I came prepared.” He was doing my husband’s when we heard him say $9.00 and then he did mine and said we were only getting $456.00 back and I said that was wrong. So he went back and fixed it or we thought he did, and it showed $1600.00 and he hit submit and came back and said we were denied because we’re not getting enough back to put money on the Emerald card. I said that was wrong. He said he would look into it and call us. Well, I have called him before and he didn’t return people’s calls. Also, I left the card there and he said, “Here is your card. Well, if you can’t get any money on your taxes, then why have the card?” I have gotten my taxes done with that agency before for 21 years but never again. I will do them myself. Also, John had stated that when we had our taxes done, that when all was said and done, we would be getting a nice refund back at tax season. Then, what is the problem? We make 50000.00 dollars a year and pay $2000.00 in taxes and we can’t get the Emerald card like we did last year. Something is wrong and it looked like they ran our credit and we did not give them permission to do that because on the bottom of the paper it said, the credit bureau information Equifax.
On November 19, 2009 I received notification from the IRS that my 2007 returns were deficient. I immediately went to the H+R Block office with the letter and my returns of the year. They reviewed the file and confirmed that there was an error. Line 16 had been left blank. Yet the Paperwork for the information was confirmed as being reviewed by the preparer. They said it was indeed their error. But, because I did not purchase "peace of Mind" for that year there is nothing she can do to assist. When I asked why should I purchase it for a simple return of no deductions, odd receipts etc. I should expect some form of good faith in preparing. She again stated she was so sorry for the error and advised that I bring the last 4 years in to be reviewed. I left everything with her with a understanding she would do her best to help fix the matter. It is now 4 days later with no resolve. I have mailed in the money owed to the Irs complete with penalties and interest. Now I have received 2 phone calls from H+R saying there is further trouble with the State filing also. And they want me to come in and sign off on ammended forms. They said the amended forms are not being mailed out they are just for their records. Again, they keep saying even though it's their error I have no recourse because I didn't purchase their preparer insurance. They're also saying I can't get any of my paperwork back till I come in and agree to sign off on the amended forms. The issue of the State error hasn't even been discussed. I paid over 200.00 for a 15 minute tax prepare, 150.00 in penalties and interest for just the 2007 year and am awaiting a bill for the years in penalties and interest for 2008 and now 2009. How can they imply that even though they made the error they take no responsibility to fix the matter ? They failed to type in the number and accidently left the space blank. What ever happen to implied warranty for services purchased ?
Someone walked in to the Brooklyn H&R Block office with a fraudalent licence and filed a tax return under my social security #. I was not able to file my own return. Now 2 years have passed, I received the federal return but not the state. H&R Block told me this happens all the time. They do make copies of the photo ID required to file the return. THe perpetrator took the RAL card and withdraw the money over a period of 3 weeks. The return showed an income of approx $30k with a mortgage of $370k. In my opinion this should have raised question as to how a person can afford a mortgage with that small of an income. VERY frustrating.
This office has been doing our taxes since 2001. What a mistake. We got audited this year, 2008, for 2006, and now the irs says we owe them well over 2300 dollars. All because the tax preparer screwed up our return on the child tax credit. I can not get any help from the office or the H&R Block headquarters. They just keep giving me the run around, and the tax preparer will not answer the phone or return our calls. As for there stand behind you guarentee, it is a joke. They do not do one thing about it.
Company did not electronically file my taxes as paid resulting in a late filing with accompanied late fees and penalties. When I approached them for paying these fees due to their negligence, they said that if I had bought the POM (Peace of Mind) warranty, they would have done so. Can you believe this? These folks are thieves. NEVER EVER AGAIN will I or anyone that I speak with about this matter do business with this firm. It was a corporate shop in Camp Creek near Atlanta. They want me to by a POM guarantee/warranty to do the job that I paid over $400 for them to do in the first place. Ludicrous! As a result, unable to secure great deal on a patio that we were having installed because a stone dealer sold the discounted bricks that we were going to purchase.
I am 54 years old and have prepared my taxes every year since I began working at the age of 18. This year, due to the need to withdrawal retirement funds early due to financial hardship, I went to an H & R Block professional so that I would be sure to pay all the taxes and penalties correctly. He prepared my taxes, then asked me if my husband and I had received our stimulus check. I couldn't remember and told him "I'm not sure, I may have but I don't remember". He said "no problem, I will go to the IRS site and use your social security numbers to check and see if you received them.". He entered our numbers and said we didn't receive them and so he subtracted the money from our return amount. We were notified by the IRS that we had in fact received the stimulus and that we owed the IRS the amount plus interest and penalties. Obviously, the preparer made a mistake when he entered our SS#'s. We purchased the Peace of Mind protection but were told after we tried to make them honor the agreement that it did not apply to any mistakes regarding the stimulus payouts. I feel that they should have honored the agreement and paid for the mistake they made.
we trusted the H&R Block staff to handle this for us, only to find that we NOW owe nearly $8000 in taxes for last year's return, as a result of the gross negligence of their employee who entered in mortgage property interest figure of $11,519 x 3 times and real estate taxes of $1,852 x 2 times for Adjustment total $24,890 ($23,038 + 1,852 - 60 OIH. We rec'd POM $5000 and $400 prep fee refund. We are entitled to receive the remaining $2,971 we will MAKE H&R Block pay -this is covered under E&O insurance
I received a notice that my 2007 federal taxes were not reported right, mainly a 1099-R from my military retirement was not reported and I had till Sept. 9 to get things straightened out. So, I called H&R Block to see if they could help since they had figured and filed it. They asked if I had checked my files. Here is where it gets bad. I had brought them into the office to make copies of the forms since we were trying to refinance our home loan. Then, I had to leave on a business trip and now they are missing. I asked for them to check their copies that should be on file there since I couldn't find mine. About 2 days later, they called back to say that all 2007 copies had been moved to the warehouse for storage. I think by law and their admission, they have to keep at least 3 years of files on site. I asked them to get them so I or she could review them to see if the 1099 was there. If so, then it is their fault and they should be liable for the extra expenses. After some phone calls from me, stressing that they get this done, I received a voice message from a woman named Brandy that H&R Block was not liable for any charges or payment to the IRS because I didn't pay them $30.00 for the peace of mind clause. She said that they had redone my claim and I could pick it up at the Crawfordsville office, but they are only open for appointments at certain times and certain days in the week and no time and day was set. I am also guessing that I am not going to be allowed to see my 2007 files or be able to make copies for my records. I am thinking about taking them to small claims court to sue for my money paid to the IRS. Do I have a leg to stand on here? Also, I'm thinking about filing a complaint to the BBB. Besides the worrying about the results and possible further inquires about my taxes, H&R Block has just made it that much worse with their lack of importance this is to me and my family. They just didn't seem to be that concerned about getting things done or about my concerns.
I had my taxes done on 02-02-2009 at H&R Block at the Fairway Center in Missoula, MT by Steve Lestiko. I have no complaint against Steve and I feel that he has done a very good job for me. I signed and picked up my tax copies when he was done and paid for the service. On August 10, 2009, in the evening, my wife received a phone call at our home and the person on the line said they had our tax information, did not know how they got it, and wanted to know if we wanted it shredded or sent back to us. We chose to have her send it to us and on the 12th of August 2009, we received an envelope with our complete tax statement and a cover ledger with the statement Confidential Client Information, Do not Copy or Remove from Office. We called our bank and credit card companies to check on our finances and to see if anything had changed, lucky for us nothing has changed, but our info was in an unsecured state. I notified law enforcement and did a report and the case was investigated. And the detective felt that after an investigation, it was a simple case where the paperwork was placed where it was picked up mistakenly, found later and sent back to me. I called H&R Block and talked to the manager of the business. He said he did not have any thing he could say and would not answer my questions and did say that a district manager was coming in on the 17th of August 2009 and she has my information. I at that time asked for her to contact me. She has not, but the detective has and explained his work and what he believes to have happened. The problem that I have is that H&R Block has in no fashion contacted me and talked to me. I feel that they owe the person that picked up my information an apology for their mishandling my information and they need to explain themselves to me and then accept the fact that they have exposed my family and myself to any number of potential problems. I know of no damage that has occurred yet, but the potential to my financial stability is devastating. I also believe that the persons that had my information and were interviewed for possible theft have sustained some emotional damage.
My husband and I went to get our taxes done. My husband and I have slight learning disabilities so sometimes, we are a little slow. I got a W2 from a temp agency and since I never heard of them, I didn't know it was the wrong tax year. Anyway, we got our taxes done and they had our last year's taxes on file and didn't check anyway, they processed it. When I got home, because I know we made much less than what they said we made, I found the error. The wrong W2 from 2007 in tiny writing on my W2. Oops, I called them right away and filed an amendment. Okay, that was done then. They didn't even give me the correct addresses to send them to and they ended up going to a lock box. Anyway, I was furious and called H&R Block to have them solve this issue. I went to another office and had to have the amendments redone by a manager this time and we were getting back more and got the correct addresses. Then we got a nasty gram from the IRS state and federal that we owe money that we didn't have and started to add on penalties. I had to pay the state and did so, but I called the IRS and explained it to them and now they have my account on hold until August 7th. This is a nightmare. I will never go to them again.
I went in January 29, 2009 to have my taxes prepared. I always have my taxes prepare by them and always felt they charged too much money but they always take the money out of my refund, which works for me (not knowing I can file them myself for free or them telling me I can do this). I got the RAL loan and everything went fine until months went by and my state taxes never came, which had sent to me in a paper check. I call IRS to see what’s taking so long and they tell me that H&R Block never sent in the forms for my state loan. I try calling them and no one answers the phone. I go to the business office everyday for 2 weeks and no one ever shows up there. Now last year, the lady that did my taxes forgot to do a part for my state taxes and she had the common courtesy to tell me and show me what form I had to mail off to receive them back. But I’m starting to think that these people are not properly trained to do people’s taxes. Now, I have to take a day off to go to the IRS building to have my taxes done over. I really feel like I should be compensated for this. This is a company that does not care about the people they are serving. They just want the money. This will be the last time I go there.
I filed my taxes this year. I was supposed to be filed jointly and get a better standard deduction but H&R Block software did not permit this and the tax consultant just misguided me to file the taxes as single. I have lost up to $3500 which I was supposed to receive since I was married I have observed that the professionals in H&R Block offices are very old and lethargic. They just want to finish their day and go home, so they never bother to give you any good tips regarding tax. Now I think it would be better if I could have gone to a CPA who is young and smart. He could have guided me the right thing at the same fees that H&R Block charges.
I am a hardworking father and husband. I usually do my taxes myself and am pretty knowledgeable about the process. By doing a worksheet, which is part of the software I normally use, I calculated that I owed almost $2,000 to the IRS. Yikes! While pondering this, I heard the TV ad for a nationally well known tax preparation services company. They guaranteed that they could do better than what an individual could because they were tax experts. I spent some time with the tax expert at the local H&R Block office. He was less than impressive and I had to remind him several times that he had errors which were obvious to me. He kept assuring me that it passed the tax scrutiny software provided by his company. The preparer came back with a figure of $700 owed to the IRS. I was pleased and I paid them $450 for them to prepare all forms and, since it was offered, I paid for their "Peace of Mind" guarantee. Total cost to me with payment to the company and the IRS was $1,150 or just over half of what I had calculated. Maybe these guys really are tax experts! Their guarantee was explained to me that if I ended up owing taxes that they had not foreseen or calculated for, they would happily cover them. They filed the taxes with my payment of $700 and, you guessed it, the IRS comes back a few days later and says there are multiple errors on this return and you owe $900 more, which is exactly what I had estimated myself and would have owed anyway! I went to H&R Block and filed a claim under Peace of Mind with the office manager stating, "This is so obviously our fault." Two weeks go by and I get a letter from their Home Office stating that my claim is denied! I called all over, trying to reach someone about this matter. Everyone within the company I talked to stated, "This is so simple. We did not file your taxes correctly. We should pay any taxes that the IRS says you owe." By this time, it is now four weeks after the claim was denied. Of course, that is what was said. However, you would not believe the phone chase, endless emails and call backs during my work time that I endured trying to get this company to honor their advertised commitment to accurate tax preparation. Finally, I went to discuss with the District Manager and was told by a claims manager, "We are not responsible. These were taxes you yourself calculated that you owed. But I can offer you a voucher for next year's tax prep." Yeah, right! I was pretty peeved. "What do I have to do?" I asked. File a BBB complaint, protest in front of the store, and go online to blog about this awful experience to anyone who will listen? To which, she said, "Don't forget that we have your personal information and your wife's SSN!" I have made numerous attempts to contact higher ups. Again, I always get from the customer service department, "We will honor our guarantee." When I went online and started to blog about this experience, I met hundreds of people who have had this same experience. I finally found the executive offices and spoke to Anthony who stated that he would do everything he could. He sent the claim back for a second look and, right again, it was denied this time with the person calling me at work. I emailed the local BBB and was told that I would have to file the complaint with BBB where the National Headquarters are in Kansas City. When I tried to do this, I was told that I could not file a complaint from out of state. So what good is the BBB? One blogger stated that this company is very bad about denying claims and feels that they are too big to be touched by an individual.
On the 15th of April 2009, my wife and I filed our taxes. During the process of filing, the agent was very helpful, resulting in us getting a refund instead of having to pay back money. After paying for H&R Block services, our refund would have been $11.00. However, as of today (26th of June 2009), we have not heard from either the IRS or H&R Block. In fact, I have made several calls to find what has happened to no avail. Either the offices are not manned or they refer me to another. It seems that once you paid, that's when the great service stops and you no longer "have people" as they so much advertise. All I need is someone to tell me what are we missing, so we can get our taxes resolved.
In April of 2009, I received a letter from the IRS informing me that I owed $1100 on my 2007 tax return. I called my tax preparer Janice at the H&R Block office and explained the letter. She told me to come right in to check out the complaint. Upon examining the letter, it was determined that income for my medical disability was not included in my tax return. Janice looked into my file that she has on me, and found the receipt showing that she was given the information, and she simply overlooked the information, thus omitting it from my return. Janice immediately issued me a check for the penalty and interest, and informed me to pay the $1100 by the due date. My complaint is, why should I pay for something that was not my fault, since the tax preparer had all the information in front of her? Janice has been doing my taxes for years with no problems. If I have to pay the $1100, I feel that this error is not my fault.
I was advised by Ms. H by filing an injured-spouse form. The only amount I was informed that could be taken out due to back child support was $600. I received half of my taxes and found out that the other half went to wife's due to the back child support. I was not informed that Texas was a community state. My refund was $4,609, I received $2,300. I feel that I was misled and taken advantage of. I was to believe one thing in regards to the safety of my return. Now if this tax person is employed to help with filing people's tax return and yet said did not know that Texas is a community property state, then I feel I should have the $2,300 returned to me and this person or should I say H&R Block make restitution to me due to not my mistake but the company's. My wife and I have no home. We have no job. We lost our personal belongings due to no home. We are in debt with family and friends that we do have. We're starving and we're tired. We have no way to pay our bills and now we have serious problems because of this; meaning my wife and I are looking at a jail time due to our bills being unpaid.

I separated from my Husband and moved to Florida from California in May 2005. My Husband went to H & R Block in 2005, 2006 and 2007 and prepared his taxes and filed as married and filing jointly and used myself and our son as his dependents. I have never received any money or help from him for our son. He then signed my name at the bottom of the returns and pocketed the refunds and stimulus that he received. I phoned H & R Block and asked them how they could let him do that and not even require the spouse to be present to sign the returns. They just told me that it was my problem and not theirs. Since then I filed my own taxes, but now the IRS are making out like it's my fault and that I am part of the fraud. I want to sue H & R Block and my ex-husband. I finally divorced him in June 2008. Please let me know of a Lawyer that can help me. I still have not received a refund from IRS for my taxes filed, since he was paid out already.
My income tax were filled out by Alberta Paz. She said I would receive 4,100, but I only received 3,100. IRS sent me a letter stating that H & R Block inputed data incorrectly and I have a letter to prove it. I told A. PAz the situation and never called me back to resolve. I asked to talk to a manager which was C. Robinson and she did get back to me, but she was very rude saying I wasn't going to get nothing back and it wasn't the company's fault and that she didn't even care if I had a letter from the IRS. I asked her if I could get my $330.00 I paid for the service and she said no. This back and forth situation went on for almost two months. They call themselves office coordinator and district manager its impossible. The consequences that I was counting with the money they promised me and I even thought they charged me alot of money to fill out my income tax when I don't even own a house.
The woman worked with me (S. Jadin from H&R Block) for approx. 30 mins., gave me no deductions, nothing new that I hadn't thought of, no advice about anything, only when I reminded her of my child credit..she took into consideration, else I would have lost another $1000. I could have filed it myself, I had a relatively easy return just one W2, The only forms needed were ITIN- W7. when asked do I not require to submit any supporting document to my W7 the woman replied no..non at all. The IRS has all that information, only to know after 6weeks of waiting IRS is sending me notice to include the supports for W7. There was no mention up front what the cost would be, They charged me $250 dollars another $30 for piece of mind, no explanation. I have repeatedly called H&R after receiving IRS notice but no one bothers to call back. even though I bought piece of mind for another $30 there has been no response yet from H&R. They should be shut down for what they charge people. I will never go there again and will tell every person I talk what they charge and to never go there. Such a lousy and Poor customer service.
On Feb 3rd, 2009, I went with my boyfriend to file his taxes. He provides over 1/2 my support, so was going to file single, with me as dependant. Patricia informed him he could not file that way, as he would get audited and not recieve his check, due to my age. She insisted the only way he could file with me as dependant is as married filing jointly. We live in a common law state, so guess what! WE'RE NOW MARRIED, thanks to her! We told her several times we're NOT married, we live in seperate homes, but she filed it as married, said it was the only way it could be done. Now I have to dish out a few hundred dollars to pay for a divorce!
My wife and I have used the services of H&R Block many times in the past. I have went through a separation and needed to do my taxes in 2007, I knew that I owed the federal taxes 2,402, but they told me that I have a return of 1,049, they told me that I could get a loan against this return, they were convinceing and explained in detail this is the way to go to pay some bills until I got my return. So, thinking that I would have the money to spend, I did. I must have spent maybe 200.00 of the loan when one day there was not any money left on the card. Left wodering what had happened, I called the (1-800) number and was told there was no return and that I owed H&R Block 565.00$? They knew from preivious returns. Why would they charge me for something they knew I could not pay back. Now I am being called at my home for some kind of payment they need from me. I know this is not right. If they knew why did they give me an expertise explaination, I believed them, and why shouldn'd I aren't they the experts?
I purchased my state (Alabama) tax e file service. It said that the funds would be deposited within 8-10 days directly into my account. This is why I chose this option, it was guaranteed. It has been 3 weeks and when I called the state revenue department to make sure that they received my return, I was told they received it but Alabama had to no funds available to pay the tax refunds and that HR Block should have known that. I guess it is posted somewhere, or electronically posted to these companies who make and regulate the tax software. Alabama will be paying refunds in 8 to 10 weeks. So basically, HR Block took my money for e file when there was no e file available. My question is did they have knowledge of the inability to pay refunds from Alabama. And since it is an online program, did they take diligence due their customers to notify them of this discrepancy? What about a banner ad that could have been added to their online program, this may have solved their (my) problem. And like everyone else, there is not a phone number to customer service to correct this problem. I did however, talk live to what HR Block says is a live chat ad visor, only to find out it is just a computer with answers to only specific questions. If you don't put one of their pre-made questions in, the computer doesn't understand. So their live chat is just as much a fraud as their tax program is in my opinion. I do agree there should be a class action suit against this company and I would offer to do some research for it. All I can say is that I feel that HR Block has deceptive practices and they need to be looked at. I am not so concerned with getting my money back because I am not sure it will happen without a class action suit. I am however very concerned when a "reputable" company takes food from the mouth of the consumer, (possibly a ridiculous amount of money) without supplying the product that was promised, then guarantees it and doesn't give you a valid contact number. It appears to me that every TV commercial was just another incident to solicit a victim.
On 3/21/09 Ronald Jones of H&R Block was supposed to file my 2008 federal, and state (AZ & CA)taxes. After not receiving any refund or confirmation I made numerous telephone phone calls. On 5/6/09 I was told by Yvonne in the district office my AZ taxes were not mailed or filed. I paid $214 in fees and they did not follow through on the services they promised.
Have used H&R Block for 4 years (all of the information is stored on their computer) and our tax situation has not changed much. I was shocked when their price went from $325 to $671 in 2008! They said that they started charging by form used and they ask you to sign a fine-print disclosure form up-front without telling you that they have more than doubled their price in 1 year. They do a pretty good job but it is not worth it as they spent about 1 hour on the return. This is a stupid move on their part to do this to loyal customers without doing some type of price sensitivity analysis!! I am not going back to H & R Block!
I filed my state tax returns on 4/3/2009, and I emailed the state of Ohio to find out why I have not received my refund yet, and they said it was not filed. I paid for the filing through HR block online, they took the money out on 4/3/2009. Not sure if the state will charge me for filing late.
I went to H & R Block (Palm Springs) on 03/09/2009 to prepare my income tax. This was my first time with them, I always file my taxes, but this time it was a little different since I was now filing married (separate). They promised to be accurate and if not they will double my income tax. I was charged $70, and a lady told me to wait 8 to 15 days. Still today I haven't got my check, so I phoned them on 04/06/2009 I was told my check had been mailed on 03/27/2009 I just had to wait. On 04/24/2009 I went to the IRS website to check why my tax was taking so long, only to find that the lady from H&R block had put a wrong address while she was filing my income tax and the check had been sent back, I was surprised and angry, that was so irresponsible because she had my ID card in her hands with a address on when she was filling up the forms. I phoned HR block again and asked to speak to the same lady, they told me she was off for the season, and she will only be back in next year. I explain the situation to the guy that was on the phone, all he said was that he was sorry and he could do much. So I phoned the corporate office and they gave me an 1800 number that only have an answering machine. So my problem is that these people have no customer service and not reliable. How can a normal person type a wrong address with a address in front of her and still charge me $70 on top of that make me wait 3months for my tax.
I am in my young twenties and very un-educated when it come to filing my taxes, I trusted this well known company to help me in doing so. Marilyn Post and her fellow associates failed to explain the fees and processes. I assumed (not knowing) after paying over $200 in standard preperation fees, that they would lick a stamp and send out my forms. No one instructed me in having myself do it. If I knew that I needed to send out MY OWN paperwork I would have saved myself $200. After not being instructed, I waited eight weeks excited for my return. I am getting married and using a lot of the return for it, and the honey moon. I called into the IRS and they tell me they have not recieved my returns. I then call H&R block just to recieve a lady on the other end, chuckeling at my uneducated actions. I explain that no one has told me their procedures and that I need help...only for her to reply with a sales pitch in having me come back in and re-file (paying all the fees again). I have gone over all of the paperwork and there is nothing stated that I need yo file my own paperwork. Last time I checked concelement of information from a financial company is fraud? I was expecting a small amount of money at about $1500. I was going to put a little away for the wedding and save the rest. now I have to use my own current income (unemployment) to pay for the wedding, in turn putting a lot of stress on my bills! not being able to pay rent, electric etc.
I used the free file to process my tax return with HRBlock's online program (a link was provided on the IRS website). I was eligible to efile a federal return because of my low income last year. The website lead me through the federal return and when I went to efile it the program led me to the State of California return and it input the information to produce the state return. When I was going to send it electronically, the program indicated that I must pay $34.95 to efile the state return. After spendin much effort and time to find a way out of this, to uncouple to two returns and efile the federal only, there was no apparent way to do so. So I paid the $34.95, only to be led to the next page which told me that California did not accept efiled returns. I then tried to find instructions on how to get my payment refunded but could not find this anywhere on their website. Since I could not efile the state and had found no way to separate the federal from the state I was forced to print the returns and mail them. the next day I went to the bank and filed a request to block the charge. Then I tried to find a number on the taxcut website that I could call to get an explanation and my money back. There was no number for customer service, so I finally found an 800 number on the main website for HR Block, I also called a local office, who told me they have nothting to do with TAXCUT FreeFile, they gave me an 800 number which referred me to a technical assistance number. When I spoke to the agent Michael, he began to interrupt me and argue with me. I asked to speak with a supervisor and he said there was none, that they "walk in and out sometimes" but that he was by himself and there were no supervisors or managers to discuss this with. I explained that the online program which was supposed to be for income-qualified people to freefile, tricks and traps the user into the $34.95 fee for the California return. Michael told me that this fee is for using their software. He was very rude and I asked him if this was being recorded he said yes. I said good because your customer service is terrible. He put me on hold for a long silence and then came back to tell me that my issue would be sent to the "escalation dept" whereafter he took my name, address, email and phone and then somehow already had my home phone number, which I had not provided. He said all of this information would be used for someone to get back to me, maybe someone by the name of Teresa. It has been 24 hours and there has been no call, no email, so I called back, they basically told me that there was no way I am getting my money back. I don't know if the "escalation dept will ever contact me. TAXCUT FREEFILE is not free and traps low income people into paying for a state return that can be completed for free on the State of California website. I want my $34.95 back. Thank you.
On 04/09 I went to file my taxes in h&r block, I been going there for years never had a problem, In 2008 i lost my home due to hardship, I received a 1099 a, i went to the hr & block in anaheim ca and i specifically ask the lady if she knew how to handle this type of form, cause i was concern with not being done properly she said yes, we are in the process she is inputing all the information and when it gets to this last for 1099a said wait for me she ask 3 other people, and they all said no you dont have to include since you leaved at the property for over 2 years, she assure me I didnt that didnt seem right to me so i contacted the irs, and they said you have to include it & you need to do an amendment, I than contact the anaheim and told them what irs said they still said you dont have to include it, on the same business card, fullerton office information was there i spoke with a tax advisor who said they were experts in filing 1099a and that they will help me, i went that friday and was told i should make an appoitment with diane for saturday at 11am, i did saturday came diane was upset said tht it was very wrong for anaheim to even file my taxes with out including this form she told me i will have to pay her $150, and i did, she also said i could contact hr block district which i did and file a complaint, I than received a call from karisa ext 1077 and explain my situation she at first agreed to send refund as long as she confirm that was an error with tax preparation, Than i received a message on 04/23 advising me that no refund will be provided since diane said if i waited 4 days she will not charge & plus a discount was given to me of over $300 it makes no sense why they will make a decision like that they are missing the whole point, I already had paid $400 to yolanda aguilera at anaheim branch and she didnt do a good & in top i was charge $150 w/ diane, no one advised me if i waited 4 days it would be free thats rediculous plus the date that diane told me to send the ammendment was 04/25 makes no sense. i than got a hold of britney who said karisa was busy with a proect she did not want to listen to my side or dispute, i ask for a supervisor & I got melanie. I am very frustruated I feel I been taking advantage & no one seems to care Please Help me with this matter thanks
I had H&R Block prepare my return along with my son's. I had a $49 coupon for the preparation of a dependent's return and was told it applied to my 20-year-old son's return. When I went to pick up the returns, I was told the cost of my son's was about $230 because I would get more back from the IRS by not including him as a dependent on my return. I then asked them to calculate it both ways and found in total it is costing me $180 more to save less than $100. I asked them to rework the returns and use the $49 coupon. I had to go out of town, so my wife picked up the returns the next day. They convinced her to pay the $230 for my son's return. I believe they took advantage of us. My son's tax information consisted of only 3 documents, 2 W2s and tuition information. I could have easily prepared it myself if I had been given the correct information by H&R Block from the beginning.
A friend of mine had worked for Block but quit because of the pressure by management to increase the size of customer bills as much as possible. She told me that the higher the bill, the more the tax preparer would earn! She also felt bad about the way Block increased the size of the bills on poor people getting Earned Income Credit. She said poor working class people are the very ones who lacked the skills to do their own taxes. They are the ones Block rips off with high charges. She told me even simple returns with one W2 often cost $100-$150! She told me she couldn't go to church on Sunday and still work for Block!
When I filed my taxes as I have done for years, I paid for the 2-day as I do every year. They messed up the paperwork by doing a very poor job. The work filed a wrong birth date so, of course, they could fix it. So I waited 13 days and still was charged 300 something dollars than I kept. Other people got the same thing from, I just don't. A person works all year and H&R Block can just take what they want because they gave you their little card. My money was stolen from my Emerald card. They did not deserve the money to mess up my taxes.
Ms. Amy ** prepared my 2008 tax forms stating that I owed the IRA $39,000+ and the state of VA $6,400. The preparation fee was to be $400+. Knowing this was impossible, I had the taxes redone by another H&R Block office where my previous returns had been prepared. There I was told there were glaring errors on the first return, which should easily have been noticed. Amounts entered did not even correspond with figures on my statements and that not only did I not owe any payment, but had a refund due to me with a preparation fee of $300+. Ms. ** had gone on vacation while all this was in progress.
H&R block messed up my electronic federal tax filing with request for direct deposit of refund. The accountant not only entered the bank account number incorrectly, but also blamed me for not checking the information myself. She charged over $200 for filing my relatively simple tax return and does not want to help or have any remorse for my suffering. I tried calling IRS and my bank, but no one is able to help. Now, all I can do is wait for paper check to arrive in 8 to 12 weeks. The money I needed so badly now would not be available for another two to three months. Who knows? My important check would bounce and my credit history would be affected, because the money did not reach in my account. Way to go H&R block!
When we met with Debra ** on 2/26/09 and after she reviewed our situation, we were told our taxes would cost approx. $350 to be done. Six weeks and 15 unreturned calls later (4/10/09), our taxes were done for a cost of $615! When we told the receptionist what we were quoted, she asked Ms. ** and she said she didn't know where we got that number because she never quoted us $350. So our taxes were going to be held hostage until we paid. We requested that Ms. ** call us and of course, she never did. I tried contacting her on 4/11/09 and 4/13/09 and have yet to hear from her. Today, I learned that a friend of the family experienced the same thing. People need to know that these things are happening.
First rep provided technical assistance, helped me install Adobe and was helpful. Second rep gave some information, neutral; third rep was grossly inappropriate, suggested unauthorized assistance with tax preparation rather than technical assistance. I requested help with e-file problem; instead, he tried to tell me how to fill out my information. Finally, e-file was not complete after two payments of $49 and $34.
I went to H&R Block to have my taxes prepared. I was having a problem with my ex-wife not signing the proper forms for me to claim my two children as outlined in my divorce creed. I did all the research from the IRS that states if my divorce was after 1984, I could submit three articles in place of the forms. So the bottom line is I did all the work. I just had to sign the papers. I was charged $270 and I make less than $50,000 a year.
I got my taxes done. I paid for H&R Block to do the taxes. I asked if the lady could send what I owe electronically. She said yes, and if she had a problem with sending it, she would call. I never got a call, but happened to check and no money ever was sent. I talked to a Supervisor Sharon ** and she said that all the H&R Blocks do not take money for IRS payment. This was witnessed by my husband and myself.
I had a relatively easy return. My federal return was filed on the EZ form and my state was easy as well. The only forms I needed were part year non-resident, but no Schedule A or any other forms were needed. The woman worked with me for approximately 20 minutes, gave me no deductions, nothing new that I hadn't thought of, no advice about anything. I could have filed it myself. There was no mention upfront of what the cost would be. I was told over the phone prior to the appointment that everyone's fee was different according to the forms required. They charged me $204, no explanation. I freaked out.
I got my taxes done with H&R Block. I was charged an outrageous price of $377. I did not know that H&R Block charges per form. The same taxes that have cost me $150 every other year were more than twice as much with HRB. They are ripping off the consumer. Had I gone online and read all the complaints from consumers, I would have saved myself a lot of money. I would not recommend HRB to anyone and I would never have them do my taxes again.
I have been a customer of H&R Block for at least 10 years. I have never had a problem. I went to H&R Block this year as usual. I called the H&R Block office previous to my visit. I explained in detail my situation. I had gotten a divorce recently and I had parental rights, custody, etc. of our child. My ex-husband had filed his taxes at H&R also and had filed claiming our daughter as his dependent when in fact she was not. I told the H&R Block office that I had the court orders stating I had the right to claim her and stating in these documents was the fact that my ex-husband has to amend his return without our daughter on his. I explained to the H&R Block office that I was wanting to file electronically for the usual reasons: the fees for the tax prep are withheld, the money is 8-15 day return, it is direct deposit, the tax guarantee. The H&R associate said all this would be no problem and they would take care of everything. And as long I as brought the court documents, it would be fine. It wasn't fine. The next day, I received a call from the H&R Block office to come and pick up my returns, due to the electronic system had rejected my filing. Why? Oh, because my ex-husband had already used our daughter's Social Security Number. Yes, I know. I told them this even before the visit.
I'm only 20 and a college student, and this is only the second time I have had to file my taxes. A friend of the family did it last year for free, but she was unavailable and it’s getting down to the time for me to get my taxes done. So I go to H&R Block thinking it’s not going to be very expensive. I made roughly $3,500 waitressing for a few months over the summer. And I started my own Passion Parties business in the last month of the year so my profit was only about $200, plus a few deductions for starting my business. They tried to charge me $190. I'm only getting back $210 from the Feds and $98 from the state! That’s almost all of my return! She barely worked with me for half an hour and I have no idea what to do. I don’t have that kind of money to pay her! I'm in college and not really working! I told her I would come back because I thought I might have some paperwork left at home, and she kept my W-2! I am at a loss on what to do.
I was extremely disappointed with the service at H&R Block. My tax guy retired, so I made an appointment. I asked what the charges were and they said they were the going rate, very competitive! We had been laid off, had 7 W-2s between us, and 4 1099s. Never once did they explain the charges. It cost me $411 to get my taxes done. I asked for a breakdown of the charges; she laughed and said it was internal in the computer. I asked 3 different times what was the estimate. They told me, "Don't worry; it is the average price." On top of that, we owe $14,382 to federal and state. I asked her what were the payment options and she said that it was out of her hands, "Call the IRS yourself." I left steaming mad. I am an easy going person. Is it legal not to disclose the cost when asked several times? This sounds really shady. It was too close to tax crunch to get in somewhere else. I went to tax advisers last year and paid $250. H&R Block will not get my business next year!
She told me $100 to fill my income taxes out. That was on Friday. So when I went back on Monday, Beverly told me it was going to be $306 and when I got to the register, it was $307. I have my receipt in my folder, so that left me with no money to pay any bills.
Accountant didn't know tax law and they have cost me upwards of $26,000 with the IRS.
We have always gone to H&R Block to get our taxes filled out. Every year we itemize because of my husband's job. After sitting there for 2 hours with Nikki, a first year tax prep grad, this year we were charged $649.00 to file the same way we did last year for $312.00. When we asked why, she said prices had gone up and she used a couple more forms. We paid it because it is close to filing date. We did not want to have to pay for their time and have to go else and pay again. Come on people, this is ridiculous. They have had class action brought against them before for consumer fraud. Please help me, somebody.
The 2007 taxes at H&R Block cost me $1034 less a $50 coupon. Never again. H&R Block charges per form. In 2006, I paid about 40% less for the same forms to be completed. You cannot get an estimate of the cost without the tax work being done. The tax preparer cannot even tell you the cost till the end of the work. This is a very sinister way to do business. Jackson Hewitt is the same way.
I used TaxCut to file federal CT and NY returns for 2005. Almost 3 years later (just before statute tolled), CT audited us over how much reciprocity CT would give us for the NY income taxes paid. The CT Department of Revenue just told me that they had audited hundreds of similar returns and found the same error by the TaxCut program on all, and were coming after all of us for the taxes; 3 years of interest; and penalties even though we had filed in good faith and properly followed the program. CT law gives reciprocity for the lesser of taxes paid to NY or taxes withheld, but TaxCut instructs you to use the NY taxes withheld shown on your W-2, which is not necessarily the lesser amount.
In 2003, 2004 and 2005, I had gone to H&R Block to have my taxes done and I had no issues until mid-2005 when I was sent a letter from the Franchise Tax Board telling me that I was being audited. I then went to H&R because I had initially purchased their Peace of Mind Insurance which is supposed to pay off any fees in an audit. However, during this time, I was trying to apply for a loan and on my credit report I had a couple of delinquent accounts. I then investigated these accounts finding out that a consultant from H&R Block used my personal information to open up credit cards in my name and received an Emerald Advance card in my name which H&R Block promotes. I contacted a regional manager for H&R Block and they apologized many times and said they would resolve the issues and never returned any of my phone call and never took care of anything.
I did my taxes this year with the assistance of H&R Block. The service was fine, their attitude was great. Days after my filing was complete, my money was not loaded on my card. Everyday that I called, I was told the same thing - it should be in after 5:00 the following day. Then weeks went by. The story was now that I would have to wait until Friday after Friday after Friday, after 5:00. I was even worried about getting charged for the 2-day refund of about three hundred dollars for that particular service, not including the charges for the tax representative himself. So again I called, brought that to their attention. I was told my refund was actually going to be higher because of the fact that the amount promised to be deposited within two days was not. Still, I was charged for all these services. My family and I were very much in need of this money. I was more worried for my negative amounts we owed to creditors, and this made us more in debt with more people. And then they promised to pay because of the two-day refund which turned out to be more than 45 days. Direct deposit was used for this also. Again I was charged more for this service too. It was trully awful to hear the money was going to be there everyday, with me passing this on to my creditors. I felt very ashamed, like I was lying.
I was being relocated to Liverpool, NY as of March 1st, 2009. So February 23, 2009, I got my taxes done at H&R Block on Delaware Avenue in Kenmore, NY. They messed up my taxes and did not notify me of any errors. They only told me they messed up because I contacted them. They told my money was deposited and I needed the money for moving expenses, to pay some bills and I bounced checks because of them. So I contacted my bank and they told that nothing was ever put in my account, and they kept telling they did. After a week of that nonsense, they finally admitted to me they screwed up. It’s been over one month and I still have not gotten anything from them! They keep giving me the runaround me and I am ready to go to the media to tell them never to use H&R Block. I feel I will get the attention since it's tax season and since our economy is bad. I am prepared to do whatever it takes to get my money and have H&R Block refund the money it cost me to do my taxes and overdraft fees they cost me!
I purchased H&R Block TaxCut software Basic Federal edition. The package and instructions did not indicate in order to use it, you had to download updated tax forms. I tried to use internet to get updated forms, and it kept cutting out and telling me to try again later. I am on dial-up, and if this does not permit a download the box should say so prominently. It also states, "If you're not completely satisfied, return it within 60 days and we'll refund the purchase price less shipping, handling... see inside for details." Nowhere inside, outside, or anywhere has the info on where to send the package for the refund. Making entries using the software was straightforward, but it was a complete waste of time and money because I could not complete my return, nor could I find a reference that would let me request a refund. The cost was $19.99, but it wasted my time and gave all sorts of guarantees but no way to get to them. An 800 number would be a great help. They give all these guarantees, but make it impossible for one to use them.
The Lemay Ferry branch made an error on my 2003 and 2004 taxes. She did not file 2003 where I had a real estate transaction. Instead, she filed in for 2004. The state was advised of the real estate transaction of 2003 and they wanted $3,800 for taxes and interest. It took a while but we figured out what happened. I filed 2003, did an amended 2004, and sent money for 2003 taxes. Unfortunately, both Fed and State have statute of 3 years so I will not get refunded the 2004 tax I should be reimbursed. H&R Block admits the mistake and said only interests and penalties are covered, not the double payment of taxes because I did not accept the Peace of Mind guarantee which covers everything. That has to be signed and paid for to get anything back other than penalties and interest. The form in the tax return is not signed by me and has no handwriting. Under signature is typed Signature on file. H&R Block cannot produce the signature.
Purchased their Tax Cut Program at Walmart. The cover plainly states: New! 5 FREE federal e-files included. When I opened up the package, it said: One free federal e-file. I used the program for 3 federal returns. I would have had to pay $19.95 I believe was the figure, if I wanted to file more than one. They are very careful not to give any address or telephone # to reach them. They gave an email address. When I tried that address, my computer said no such address. I did not suffer any damage because I did not pay to use their efile. So I did not have the advantage of efiling. Actually, their program is good. I am not looking for any remedy, just would like to warn others.
my husband and i have been useing H&R block for about 10 years now and no problem. We got a letter from the Irs stateing that our 2007 return was not filed properly. The lady that did our taxes that year filed our income to the Irs $ 10,000.00 less then my husbands w2. Now because of her error we owe the Irs $1,585.00. We have contacted them and because we didnt take out There peace of mind garrentee, all they can do id refund what we paid them to do our taxes and intrest up till april this year. In total they will give us a check for $385.00. I would liketo know how her messing our taxes up this badly is our fault. I understand we didnt take the $30.00 garrentee, but who would have thought that a $ 10,000.00 difference would have accured. I feel they should be responsible for this not us, and i would like to know if we can do anything about this. we now owe $1,585.00 that is not our fault. We dont have that kind of money laying around. I already have acute anxiety disorder and this is not helping.
Dear Sir/Madame: My husband and I went to HR Block, Greer, to have our taxes prepared. After 3 hours in the office, with not much confidence in the preparation, we were told the fee to prepare our taxes was $538.00. My husband and I have always paid our bills and in this uncertain economic time, those charges were very very shocking. They told us they charge by the form. I feel we should have been informed of the fees prior to the preparation. We were not and after 3 hours spent, we certainly did not want to have them charge us for their time and we would have to pay again if we choose to utilize a different venue. It is very disheartening to know that they took almost half of our return. Last year we paid $200.00 and had one less form than this year. Thank you for your time. charged $538.00 for tax prep. see above for details.
I have worked with HR Block for a few years now, but this year's experience was not only unprofessional on their end, but also very frustrating for me. I had an appointment with someone at their premium location on Wilshire and when I got there, the person I made the appointment with was, of course, at another location. A senior tax consultant named Carmen took my case then (very straight forward tax return) and we were done within minutes. All good I thought. Well, weeks later when I still hadn't received my money, I started to get worried. Long story short: The SENIOR tax professional Carmen entered a wrong ABA number and my money was in limbo. Of course it took me days to even figure out why my money wasn't in my bank account because according to the IRS the money was successfully deposited (just not into my account). When I finally found out what the problem was (with no help of Carmen) and I informed HR Block the only response I got was there is nothing we can do, the IRS needs to fix it. Nobody at HR Block had a clue how to fix this. I had to take a trip to my bank account, take a day off from work for this, and ask a bank rep to help me, who luckily, was kind enough to do so. After finally being able to get a hold of the branch manager, Christina, the bank employee and I told her what to do. After days, when it was finally resolved, no follow-up call from Christina. I inquired about their satisfaction refund policy but of course, that went unanswered as well. I even told them that I was going to take legal actions, but they don't seem to care! Needless to say I am not going back to HR Block. I had to take a day off from work. Needless to say the numerous calls to the IRS, my bank and HR block. I needed that money, just like everyone else, to pay for rent and other bills. My refund money was a full month late.
I file my tax return on 03/08/2009/. My refund was 1,541. All that was direct deposit was 1,141. In my checking? There is an error on 2008 Federal Income Tax Return. The amount enterd was computed incorrectly. Taxpayer Identificantion Number. Thank you.
I went to H & R Block on 2/26/09 to have my taxes done. When I came home I reviewed the file and there was a huge mistake that could have caused me to be audited. The fees for this services were obscene, $284.00 plus a $29.95 bank fee. I only made $15,000.00 in 2008. The fees were not explained up front. Mr. C said he never tells people the fees unless they ask. I told him I changed my mind and did not want to use his service within 24 hours of the tax service. He said it was to late and the tax return had been filed. I don't feel comfortable about this tax return. Mr C couldn't even find the page the mistake was on and I had to keep repeating page 2. He said he would correct the mistake but I was stuck with his service. I asked for a complaint/customer service number for H & R Block and he gave me a wrong number. There must be some recourse for poor business practice when it was brought to the attention of the business in less than 24 hours. H & R Block fee of $284.00 Bank fee of $ 29.95 Possibility of an IRS Audit with no documentation to support the file.
The week of the 16th of March, I called H & R Block, and told them that they used the wrong percentage on my State form. They used 35% instead of 40%, I told them that I should have gotten back 40% on my State form for the EITC. They told me I did. They pulled up my file and told me that I got back $356, I told them that I did not receive $356, I received $312. So first of all they amended my form behind my back, and without my signature. When I went to see Jim, I had to show him the form they filled out showing $312, he refused to give me a copy of my State form, he would not give a reason. They also have a honor system, of refunding the preparation fee, if they make a mistake. Which they do not honor. I called another H & R Block in some other state, and she went into my file and she told me that my file was amended on Feb. 5 to $356, that was the date I filed my taxes with them. I called up the state and they refunded me the $44 difference. But I don't think that any one has the right to go behind your back and amend your Taxes and not tell you about it. They also did not honor the pledge they made if they make a mistake. The supervisors and the Headquarters have done nothing about what happened. The state changed the percentage to 40% for the EITC on January 29, 2009, I found that out from the Washington Post. They showed me a letter stating that the 40% EITC was changed on Feb. 6. I just recently call H & R Block back, and I asked again for a copy of my State form, and they told me I would have to pay $30 for one piece of paper. I have received no help from H & R Block employees. If you can help me I would appreciate it.
We file at Hr every year. This year we had a gut feeling that the guy was not legit. Sure enough they messed up our taxes and had them direct deposited in a different account. We had hoped to take a family trip for spring break. Now no one can find the money and if we are lucky we might see our refund in June. They charge so much and then make mistakes. The guarantee they offer does not cover this. The manager was rude at first and did not want to admit fault. Her name is Robin S and the tax prep guy is John G. Maybe if he wasn't so busy joking and talking he would have focused on our taxes. Our family trip is now cancelled and a debt we had hoped to pay off will need to wait and we will continue to pay apr on it as a result.
This is the 4th year that I have done my taxes with H&R block and I can tell you that they are taking advantage of the consumer this year. I have been out of work since May of 2008 and had a year of many hardships. Like every other year I needed to get my taxes done and as a sole proprietor it is a little more complicated. This year was actually much simpler then years past because I only had two clients this year and made a total of $38,000. I had two bank accounts which made minimal interest. My business deductions were standard as were my personal deductions. There was nothing new this year. I was charged $677.00 for my tax return. I couldn't believe it! There was no reason for this. Last year which was more complicated because my business was thriving cost me $300.00 less. This is a total outrage, when more then ever I need to keep my money. I am a single mother with a son who I am raising who is in high school and an older daughter with her 3 month old baby who lives with me and I help support. I have been living on my savings which are dwindling away. I would like to know how this return which took less then one hour could possibly cost $677.00. After reading others stories I feel there needs to be some kind of action taken against the company who are ripping off the poor consumer.
as with many other complaints with h&RBlock and their Emerald Card. This was done (to me) on Jan. 2,2009, being new to H & R Block they used me as a learning tool, neither the manager or the agent did not know how to process this. we were not informed of all the fees associated with this card, only an annual fee ($45.)deducted from the amount on the card. on feb. 6, 2009 we went in to have our taxes done and was told we owed $526. on the Emerald card. i informed them i had recieved a statement showing a balance of $509.80 including a finance charge and annual fee due on feb. 15, 2009, end date Jan. 21, 2009. the differance of $16.20. they told me to call the card there no one could answer me. again i call on feb.12,2009 spoke with a gentlemen named Ryan, he put in a dispute and told me on feb. 15, 2009 the money ($16.20) would be on the card and to call and cancel (card). now on that date and on the 16th, 17, 18, still no money. another call on feb.21, 2009 was told there was no record of that conversation to now call (1-800-h&rblock) there i was redirected to call (1-888-) Finally on Feb. 25, 2009 spoke with someone who understood the problem and created a case for me i called at 1-866- on march 13, 2009 spoke to C. Whaite who was very rude. i tried to ask her why i recieved another statement and another finance fee ($15.76) and had an on going dispute and had cancelled the card in feb. all in all i was charged a filing fee $138. $29.95 for e-file (that's another problem). all unnessary card fee's and a run around. like many complaints what will you be doing to stop them in the future. as far as going to H&RBlock never again told my family & friends not to either.
I have used h7r block to file my taxes every year. This year I did the refund anticapation loan with the emerald card and it was a night mare. I was told when i file my taxes the balance to pay this off would come out of my taxes. Before this they were charging late charges to my card and I still had money on it and tried to pay my acct with that but thery would not accept it. To make a long story short when i filed my taxes the balance of the card was paid out of that. Well the next month I got a statement to pay $2.17..i CALLED THE TAX ADVISORS OFFICE AND APPARENTLY THEY DID THIS TO MORE PEOPLE AS WELL. We were told we would have to pay it and then the balance would be in full. I can not believe that these banks are getting away with this. I know that they had to make a killing because at leat in this town alot of peopole used that card. I hope these banks will pay for the damage they inflict on paople.
On Jan. 30th we filed our 1040. we claimed all 4 persons living in our household for the past year. We support them. It was sent electricroncaly. It came back saying someone had already claimed one ofour dependants. We went back to the office on Feb. 2nd and tried to file again. It kicked it right back saying the tax agent had put my social in wrong. She filed again and it spit it back saying our other dependant had also been claimed. We filed again for th 3rd time sending proof that we supported these 2 peop;e. We had to mail it this time as it was the 3rd time. They recieved our papers at IRS on the 4th of Feb. by overnight and on the 30th March we have recieved a letter from the IRS informing us that our taxes were not properly signed and we signed them in the office before the tax advisor sealed. The letter says we will now have to mail them back and wait 6-8 more weeks. This Master Tax Advisor is K. Bohland. When I call te office she will not return my calls. We are now going to have our power and phone/Internet turned off and we will lose our home. I feel that 2 mistakes by her are too much. Thank you
I had them filed for my income tax for 2008 with a stunning charges of $522. I never thought it's going to be this high until everything was done, complained and shocked, I paid them anyway. To begin with, she said it will start at $65, and I thought it might just go up the same as last year which they charged me with $225. In fact they corrected my 2007 returns after receiving a letter from IRS....which I believed it's their mistake because I had all the income receipts for them and they missed something that need to be included. For that matter there was no charge because it's on their part to do the corrections I believed considering with their ads saying satisfaction guaranteed. I received again a letter from the IRS and brought it back again to them, this time she said there might be $55 charges I said why would I be charged then she called her district manager who did the correction of my 2007 returns and that settled without charge so she faxed a letter to the IRS on my part that everything is being taken care of. I happened to bring all my income tax receipts with me for this year so I decided to have them filed it for me again this year thinking of the amount around $200 the same as last year since I brought all my income tax receipt for 2008. I am a part-time substitute teacher and stay-at-home mom. With this amount she charges me is keeping me awake all night, I wished I knew ahead of time or she should tell me that it's going to cost me so much money along the way, I could have just filed it myself if I knew she will charge me this much. What bother me too is that she's not telling me the whole thing about the charges beforehand because if I knew the amount then I knew my limit if I can afford it. She told me after she was done and after I complained of so much money she said there's a charge of $3.00 per paper she go through and just now I called her to complained about her charges and asked for further explanation of the amount she said this time that with just those papers she looked at it's already $169.00. I said what's the difference of last years filing charge? she said because there were some items that they missed on it. I am completely bothered by this, I am not earning so much money, I have no assigned worked due to school budget cut, and have 3 children to take care of and to charge me this high is hard to understand. I just wished she told me beforehand or even along the way during the process that I am getting to this certain amount. Please help me to find out, am I wrong to complain like this or should they really charge me this high? I asked a few people with the same situation like mine they didn't pay that much. I paid the amount she charged me even though I felt bad about the cost of the filing and wished that I could stop her in completing the paperwork if she just warn me that it will cost me that high or at least told me the entire cost ahead of time. I could have used half of that money for the expenses of my children. i am just disturbed why I allowed her to do it.
In 2008 I filed my 2007 taxes with H&R Block. I thought something on my return didn't look right and brought it to the attention of the preparer. She assured me that she had taken care of everything. Thinking everything was ok, I paid my $251.00 fees and went on my way. This year I received a notice from the IRS stating that I owe them almost $1,300 dollars. Upon receiving this notice, I contacted the office where I had them done and setup and appoint to have the issue reviewed. I had not looked at or touched the folder containing all the information since the day I left the office the year before. When the wife and I got into the office the lady reviewed the letter from the IRS and said that I must have forgot to bring something in. I told her that everything I had brought the first time around was altogether in that envelope and it has been in the file cabinet since the day I left her office. She then began taking it apart to find all the information. She got the page where she had stapled the W-2s etc and begans accussing of us stapling it together improperly and trying to sneak in the document that she overlooked when doing my taxes. My wife became very agitated at the accusations and told the woman that there is no way we could have added the information to the stack of papers. The woman accused us again of having tampered with the packet. My wife pointed out that there is a single staple through all the information and only a single staple mark from when I originally had the taxes done the year before. Not only that but the pages had been squared up when stapled so there would be no way to add a page to them. We don't even own a stapler large enough to punch through that many pages. I asked the lady what we needed to do because H&R Block advertises that they will pay any penalties due to a mistake they make. The lady began accusing us of tampering with it again but told us that we could file a 'Client Contact form' and that they would do a revised tax form to resubmit to the IRS. She then called another lady from the office in who explained the process to her right in front of us. As she began filling out a form on the computer, I noticed she entered in the wrong date and was using the wrong tax document to get the information from. I asked her about it she took an offensive tone with me for pointing it out. At which point the wife and I had seen enough of how incompetent and disrespectful this woman was and asked to have the other lady in the office to come in and take care of us. She called the other woman in and made a few snide comments to her about 'taking care of us and to hurry us out of there.' She paced around the office for a short time and then told the woman taking care of us that she was going to go on break muttering something under her breath as she walked out of the office. The other woman who took care of us was very good and kept trying to keep the focus off of what just happened. She informed us that H&R Block does not pay the owed amount up front, but that we must pay it now and that H&R Block will refund us the money in 2 to 3 months. She gave us all the amendment paperwork to send in to the various taxation departments and told us that she would retype the 'Client Claim form' and mail us a copy of it. In the meantime, the wife and I are forced to come up with money to pay off taxes or suffer even more interest and penalties that we can't afford. I paid the intial $251.00 to H&R Block for service they did not complete properly. I owe the IRS an additional $1288 (1220 + interest) from 2007. I owe the state an additional $221 from 2007. I owe the school district an additional $92 from 2007.
180.00 to fill out my taxes that took her about 15 minutes to do. i in my wildest thoughts never thought it would cost that much. i went in there thinking that 100.00 would be way to much. i learned a valueable lesson. Ask how much first. they should be shut down for what they charge people. i will never go there again and i will tell every person i talk what they charge and to never go there. shame on them.
i filed my taxes on the 11th of march i check where's my refund on IRS.gov and it had said that my money would be on my card by march 20 2009 so i waited all day and never got my money so i called the emerald card bank becuase i was having my money dreict depoisted on the card and they told me my money would be there on monday it was a saturday that i called all day monday i have called to try to talk to some one about my money and now they are telling me that i will not reseve my money until next friday and i keep getting the run around and still have not gotting any info about my money i would tell everyone you know not to use H&R block they are not out to help you they are out to take your money and not give two cents about what you need the money for if you cant pay your bills they dont care because its not them i could lose a lot of the stuff i own my lights could be turn off and my could lose my apartment because of them giving me the run around
I filed my taxes at H&R Block this year knowing I had problems last year with the service so I went to a different location. Well I got the money on the Emerald Card. Everything went through fine and I noticed a direct deposit slip I can use for employment. So I figured I would use it only because it is conveniant. The first deposit went through fine. The second I have no idea. I rearly ever use it because I let my paychecks build up on there from a part time job then at the end of the month take it off to pay rent. I had no money so I looked to see what i could spend and notice it wasnt right. 6 days after the deposit date the check never went on. I called H&R Block Emerald Card customer service talked to an automated lady telling her my situation then another lady came on started talking about the IRS and some other money. I let her know this was a payroll check I was asking about. She replied oh hold on one moment and hung up. I called back and got the same lady told her I didnt appreciate being hung up on, she only said what is your birth date. So i gave it to her continued to let her know I contact my job they said there was nothing they could do about the check because it was already deposited to call the card back. She asked for the routing number and the account number which i didnt have because I gave it to my job so I asked to not be charge and she sent me to and automated lady telling me my ballance and hung up again. I am being charged $2 for every customer service call. Call the job then call her back SAME LADY who then tells me she can not help me further so i ask to speak to a manager or supervisor and she tells me there is not one. THERE ISNT, she must run the company I guess. But she hung up on me again. So i call another number back and dont put in my card number and talk to a male who asks for my information and tells me he dosent see my deposit, Im like I KNOW THAT IS WHY I AM CALLING. So he said speak to the H&R Block Bank and gave me a fake 1866. this number has no relation to H&R Block. Finally I searched the internet on complaints with this company found a phone number. This lady as really helpful I told her my situation and she said she had good and bad news. She found my money but it was on another card. I never ordered another card SO i have no idea where it is. She said she was going to cancel that card and issue another but I wouldn't get it for a week. Ive read other stories with the same issue so i will see if I get it by friday next week if not I will be taking further actions. This issue hasn't caused any type of economic stress yet. I am very stressed though because of this issue. I am a very young mother of 3 children. I go to school full time and work 2 part time jobs. If i don't receive this money It will cause me to be late on my rent trying to catch up. And i feel as if i worked to hard weeks for nothing. Companies should not get away with things like this.
Call for a report on stock log and was told that for his record only. Made several calls. Case closed without satisfation. Spoke with two managers. All documented, but no phone calls returned. Will be reporting to Better Business Bureau due to poor handling of this situation. I paid for his service and now he has forced us to use other service after many years with H & R Block. We have no log for last years stock update, a service we paid for and cannot get a copy. I feel we were being forced to stay with H & R Block and would have if this info was copied to our return.
My husband had taken our taxes into H & R Block, as we do every year, to have them filed. The lady that they made his appointment with has apparently figured somethings wrong or did not communicate well with my husband. He did not file them that day. He came home and told me what she had said so I decided we should have the accountant where I work take a second look before we file. I called our local branch this morning to make arrangements to have him pick our tax papers up and was told that we would not be able to do so since he didn't give them the authority to file them yet. She then proceeded to inform me that if I wanted to get them I would have to go through the manager, who was, of course, not available for me to speak to. Is that even legal? Can they keep our W-2's? I will never step foot in there again! I've been going there for the last 10 years and have never been treated like that! Never again! They have lost a dedicated client and I WILL be telling family and friends about this occurance! HEED MY WARNING! Save yourself your sanity and peace of mind! We are now LATE filing because they will not return the paperwork. We are expecting a refund that would have gone to car payments, rent and other needed things. My husband is currently laid off and we are in dire need of our refund. With 3 kids, times are tough and the last thing I needed was to be bullied around by some scam artist tax company!
My husband and I usually prepare our own taxes. This year we were puzzled by a form that our bank had sent us related to the sale of our house last year. This form was for abandoned property and looked like it would apply to people who had foreclosed on a house, which we had not done. We went to H&R Block to see if they knew what to do with this form. They would not listen to us when we told them that we had sold our house directly and that we had not foreclosed on it. They kept insisting that we just needed to fill out some other tax form related to this form. This did not seem right to us, and we felt that we were being treated like scum so we took our paperwork and left. After we were later finally able to get through to someone at our bank, we found out that this form had been sent to us in error and they sent us the correct form. We finished our taxes ourselves. Despite our complaints about their incompetence and lack of service, H&R Block is now billing us for a $29 consultation fee. What a scam.
After using their online services this year, I was faced with having to verify my ssn and identity with the IRS when I have had no previous issues W for the last 13 years. I am also unable to contact their online customer service because they do not have one--they just have a local office that you can use (with a fee, naturally). They advertise a guarantee for their services but there is no easy way to access this, if at all.
I filed my taxes online and the program said it was error free and my refund was to be $3629. Irs took my entire refund, stating that there was an error. I have so many bills backed up.
Their online tax preparation is a joke. Not only did it say that I didn't qualify for the EIC, it also said that I OWED the government over $2,000!!! I did the dang form 3 times to see if I'd input something incorrectly...I hadn't. I then went and did my taxes with TurboTax, and not only did I qualify for the EIC, I also got back over $2,300 federal. Sheesh. I'll never use H&R Block, and am glad I didn't end up having to pay them anything for the near heart attack that they gave me.
I was charged an additional $100+ for one form - One page. There were about 3 or 4 questions to answer. I could not believe the cost, especially with the economy situation the way it is today. This was highway robbery. I will not use them again and I am telling all my friends and acquantiances not to go to H&R also.l Again, I just cannot stop thinking about this terrible cost.
When filing my taxes they made a computer error which causes my refund to be helded up at IRS.I went there to ask for help and they wouldn't even make a call for me,i had to do all the work myseft to find out what the problem was and then had to wait 5 weeks to get my refund.I paid 304.00 to get it back in 8 to 15 days i tryed to get some of my money back from H&R but they refused.I feel cheated and unhappy with their treatment.It not right to pay for service that you do not get.They even lied to me about the mistake they made.
Well, we went there with all our information. I mean everything because I kept every single receipt we had. I just didn't know what was tax deductible so I kept everything in order, we always used a friend to do our taxes before and we depended on that friend so much that we never really new much about taxes. This year we decided to use H and R block to see if they could help us more by letting us know what is really deductible and what we should do to maximize our returns. My husband also worked in another state and had information there too so I wasn't sure how to do our taxes, so we decided to give H and R block a try. First that lady really didn't do anything for us, she told us to calculate everything ourselves and then give her the numbers, and the worst part is she didn't tell us anything about taxes. We had some medical expenses that we wanted to know if it was deductible and she couldn't tell us if it was or not. We had so many questions and all she could tell us was that we had to do our own calculations and all she does is enter it in. Huh, she charged us $340.00 and then told me to learn from her and become a tax preparer. FOr $140.00 I could learn from her, wow the nerve of her. She told me that maybe next year I wouldn't have to pay and that I could do it all on my own. So I went home and went on to turbo tax for the federal tax and entered in all the numbers I calculated myelf, and guess what? Yah, I got the same return for FREE! I may have lost some money in this but I learned a very valuable lesson, NEVER go to that H and R block AGAIN!
Their fees are all hidden and they will rip you off. They charged me $500 dollars to file my taxes this year which is outragoues. I had no choice but to agree because he had already did all the work and I needed the money asap due to the economy. Sad how many ppl are being ripped off by these ppl. I and many others will no longer use thier service. I was depending on my tax refund to pay my rent off which was behind due to the job loses. Now that they ripped me off I was down a few hundred dollars then to top it all of we filed 1-2 day return and didnt see our refund for 3 weeks. This ppl need shut down and all us that got robbed want our money back.
My wife and I are Truck Drivers and file our taxes jointly. We filed early this year and were assured of a nice return. We paid for direct deposit and for 8-15 day return. So here it is a month and a half after that and no return. Received a notice from IRS that the tax preparer had made errors on our return and the amount to be refunded would be much less. Called H & R Block and they seemed so surprized by the entire incident. But in the end, our fees charged by them were NOT adjusted nor have we received a refund for the early return. We live and we learn by mistakes. Just by chance, my wife had been a Broadcast Engineer for a local NBC news tv station. With so many errors and customer service complaints against the HEARTLESS H & R Block Tax firm, alittle bad publicity is headed their way. Needless to say, they will be suffering a small loss on next years taxes as well. Everything works out when you are motivated. Definitely changes some plans for the refund but in the end, the knowlege we gained regarding tax preparers credientials and consumer credibility really made me excited about next years tax time. Truth be known, if you depend on your return to be accurate and error free, go to a CPA and AVOID at all cost, H & R Block.
I had H&R block file my taxes this year. The man was unfamiliar with how to file my taxes because I traveled with my job and had mileage/housing receipts. After getting his supervisor over, I thought we had it completed. He printed the forms and I signed them. He then folded them and placed them in the IRS envelope and I mailed them that day. Five weeks later, I get my tax information back from the IRS with a letter advising that all the necessary forms for the mileage/lodging were not included. I went back through my information and did not have a copy of them in my paperwork either. I was upset and went to the H&R Block Office. I showed the woman there the IRS letter. She asked what I wanted her to do. I told her to fix it. Although I was upset, I did not raise my voice. She then said, You don't need to come in with an attitude. I told her that for the $261.00 I paid them to do my taxes that I expected the work to be professional and correct. A supervisor came up and told her to print me the forms. I was looking at the window when I heard, Here are your forms. As I turned she tossed them on the counter and walked off with a very poor attitude. With all the problems with the economy, I needed that refund money NOW to get me through this difficult time.
H&R Block prepared my taxes, I recieved a loan before my taxes was prepared. On March 6th I recieved my refund I was charged twice for the loan. Pass due bills which I was going to use the monies.
Last year my taxes were filed incorrectly through H&R Block. I was married and they were filed as me being head of household. Because of this error, I believed that I could file the same this year, for 2008. I went through them for the sole reason that I could get my taxes advanced on the emerald card and not have to wait. I don't make much money and support two children and a disabled husband. We were in the process of getting a home loan and we needed the advance as quickly as we could in order to secure our home and since it worked fine the previous year I was under the impression that it would be the same. I also got the tax advance (here comes the real let down) and was told that it would be paid by my tax returns. It is not March, about six weeks after I filed, and I have not heard anything about my taxes. WHY? You ask? Because I was forced to file jointly (even though my husband did not want to file at all, so yes I consider this to be forced). I had to file an injured spouse. Unfortunately for HRBlock, if they actually filed that WITH my taxes I would have to pay their fees out of pocket. No can do. Though had I known this is how it would go, I would have borrowed the money instead. So instead of explain the situation for me they opt for the easiest thing for THEM- make ME send the injured spouse form through the mail so that they could file my taxes right then and there instead of actually have to DO something about the situation that they SHOULD have known about but they had messed up my taxes the previous year... heaven forbid they actually correct the problem. So they couldn't even fgiure out WHERE I had to send the form! That was really reassuring. They also only had to do this one other time, so they said, so they weren't real sure. WOW I felt good. Here I drove 60 miles to pay about $300 for some incompetant fool to mess up my taxes for the second year in a row. I didn't know they had messed up my taxes the previous year until I went in this year. SO now I am getting letters in the mail that I have to pay my cash advance by the fifteenth of March... only days away! These so called tax professionals should know that I have filed an injured spouse form (therefore prolonging my refund) and then know that since they have it set so they get paid before I do- they will eventually get their money. I was told that if I didn't file joint I wouldn't get my EIC, which is funny... because then I asked if they had caused me to get a lower refund last year due to their mistake... oh no they claim i got all I could have. THEN TELL ME - why would it be different this year? It makes no sense. These people have NO idea what they are doing! NONE! So I paid these idiots two years in a row to mess up my taxes. now we didn't get the house, got less tax returns last year, haven't heard anything about our returns this year, drove down there twice to have them file incorrectly. I mean, the damages are intense for us. I am irate. Driving to Grand Rapids, one year it was about 85 miles one way. The 2nd year it was about 60 miles one way. The money I PAID to have my taxes prepared twice. Had I known I was not going to be able to get my taxes back immediately I would NOT have gone to them. The money I owe for the advance. That is about 800... because I would NEVER have gotten this had I known this was going to be the situation. It WAS something that could have been foreseen. They know good and well the injured spouse form can cause taxes to come late. I NEVER would have gotten the advance- or they never should have given it to me. The money I lost because they filed me incorrectly and supposedly I didn't get the earned income tax credit I should have. Not getting the home we wanted. all of the expenses along with looking for the home, etc. We would not have been doing this had we known we were not going to get my taxes immediately. All goes back to their mistake the previous year that made me believe that I would get them immediately.
we went into h&r block to file our taxes. it was the worst service ever. we basically filed our taxes. he just typed in for the efile was told all the money we paid for child care we had recipts said it didnt matter any ways. we paid 299 for our money to be deposited in ten days. its been 30 days now the irs put our money in h&r accont and they was to pay us. all H&r block is saying our money has been deposited but there is know money. i am wanting to file a law suit. on this behalf they are very mis leading and holding our money. we were counting on this money to catch up on our bills. now we are way behind and all income tax will be going to bills because of interest rates and we are facing being evicted
THey have nerve charging over $200 to file. They do not back u up if there's a problem..and they want toc harge you for this service. If they stand behind their word, they shouldn't charge you extra for protection. We waited on line for over 2 hrs. First person to handle our taxes didn't know how to do the paperwork for an out of state return. Today I receive a letter from IRS stating we owe over $1000 from 2007..after checking all my paperwork, this person who did my taxes omitted part of my husband's pension. And she stapled the work she did right on the cover. I will never GO BACK..ever!! Incompetent people... Consequence is, how am I going to pay this $1000 when it was theie error, especially in this economy?????
Just about a month ago my wife and I had our taxes done by H & R Block. We went to H & R Block because they were cheaper than other places and the place we went to last year messed up our taxes. We dropped off all of our information and went in later that evening to go over all the information and sign the paperwork. After all of this, we found out that we were getting quite a return because of the $7,500 first-time home buyer credit. A week went by and we finally got our return deposited into our account. Not too long after that our realtor, who happens to be a friend of ours, informed us that we were not elgibile for the $7,500 tax credit because we used another first-time homebuyer program through the state. Immediately I called the local H & R Block to discuss this error with them. I also asked that they refund my preparation fees since they made such a costly mistake. The local office was quite rude with me and said they would not refund my money so I contacted a corporate office. I was then transferred to a Kansas City office and was told a District Manager would review the case. A District Manager never reviewed the case, so it was escalated to a Regional Manager. After a few more phone calls I made to them, they finally told me the IRS told them it was a legitimate credit. I asked for a signed copy of that statement faxed to me. They said they probably couldn't do this, so I pressed further and found out it was not a legitimate credit for us to take. I have now left 4 messages with the Kansas City Office and have not received one reply. Every time I call the receptionist tells me they are all busy and they will call me back. After a month of fighting this and trying to get my taxes corrected and my fees refunded, I am beyond frustrated. I would like to see them pay for the $5,000 they guarantee to repay if they make a mistake (since I got the extended guarantee for $30 extra). I am at the end of my rope. One thing is for sure. I will never use H & R Block again, I will pay the extra money to have them done by a CPA. H & R Block is the worst tax preparation company I have ever worked with. Not only that, but they will not stand behind their guarantees either. This has cost me numerous hours on my cell phone...jacking up my bill. My wife and I, although we didn't spend the $7,500 yet, were planning on paying off some bills and putting the rest into CD's to collect interest.
I went into the office and i Filed my 2008 Taxes. My funds where due into my account on the 23rd. Due to I.R.S fixing my return the funds where to be deposited on the 27th of Feb. I call H&R Block this morning and they state that I will be receiving a check in 3 weeks. The guy that prepared my taxes used my wrong information. Which made my taxes take longer to come in. FOr that I could have done the taxes myself and still have receieved my funds faster than with this company. My car payment was late i had to pay late fee's. My cell phone got disconnected. It has set back all my bills since i counted on the funds being in my account by a certain day.
My husband and I have been going to H&R block for 6 years now. We have known them to be a little sloppy but we realize how sloppy until 2008. We got our taxes prepared in 2008 by a woman that had the most experience in the office - over 20 years. After it was all said and done, we ended up owing the IRS over $6k. I questioned it at our visit but she couldn't explain in detail. I called the IRS with those same questions and it turned out the Block made a HUGE mistake on our return. I spent over 10 hours in a different Block office to get our taxes amended. And because of the amended return, we qualified for the 2008 stimulus rebates checks but didn't receive it because it was based on original returns only. Now we were out of $2100 and also $627 which we paid to get our taxes filed. The IRS assessed us penalties and interest of which Block hasn't paid yet. So I contacted the local District Manager for a full refund but in turn, I was only given $103 for the form(s) that were incorrect and was issued a H&R Block District Managers discount certificate to be used on my 2009 return. Well Block just completed our return and the coupon code didn't work which meant that I had to pay for it out of pocket - $189. I've opened a case with customer service only to have it closed out without any reasons on why it was closed and the case wasn't even resolved. I opened a 2nd case and specifically requested a full refund for a 2nd time. I just want my full refund for 2008 and 2009 plus the penalties and interest I was assessed but I'm not getting anywhere with the DM. I need some help on getting this resolved. I have spent countless hours on the phone and in H&R Block offices trying to resolve this but no luck. It has caused me stress and headaches during this process. I've also lost all confidence and trust in their company and refuses to use their services in the future.
My girl friend and I went to H & R. Block at separate times. They told my girl friend that she could claim the children on an earned income credit and I could claim them as dependents for a maximum return. The false part about the above statement is the maximum return. My girl friend made just over $2,000.00 for the year of 2008. I on the other hand made a little over $10,000.00 and if I claimed both children as dependents and earned income credit the return would have been substantially more. They than offered no solution. My girl friends return was $833.00. My return if claiming the children would have been $5,997.00. Instead because of following their recommendations I only received $1,904.00. This is a loss of at least $3,260.00 that is if my girl friend got a $0.00 return. The loss is most likely higher based on their recommendations.
I went to do my taxes at this H&R office over at Fort Dix, NJ. I was never told during the whole 5 to 10 minutes tax filling process that it was going to cost me $200 to do my taxes. I am an individual filing alone but married I don't own a business or a corporation to pay such a ridiculous amount of money. I work hard for my money. The guy wasn't even confident or sure of some of the things he was doing to charge me $200 dollars and instead of getting money back I owe IRS $800 dollars. I could have otherwise done it myself, file my taxes, or find someone else, even do it online. I want my money back or at least part of my money back This is my 2nd time using H&H block and both times were never pleasant experience. What is up with this company.
I call two different no. one to let them know i lost my card, and that 2300.00 dollars was missing i fill out a police report, and still after 2weeks of calling them, i still haven't recover my money, was giving the run around phoney telephones no. and still haven't recover my funds for the third week, i am still trying to talk with someone about my money being recover, and still getting the run around about my 2300.00 dollars, still trying to get in touch with H&R Block. please help. I Also have my direct deposit going to them also, diffent routing no. money from IRS not matching what i suppose to have, also a lot of bank fees been taken out, yes i am concern, and want my monies recover, help please. behind in my rent and bills. spend 1 hr. on phone every day, and charge a 2.00 fee every time i speak with a live person, also being deducted from account. this is hurting me, economically, because i can not meet my bills. Mentally, burn out worrying about my money.
Met with a generic Tax preparer at H&R Block to have him look over my paperwork and let me know if I should file a long form with deductions or a short form. I am single, no kids to claim, no property and all I had in extras were two cars that I bought last year which I paid taxes on. He looked over my W2 from the only company I work for, and therefore concluded that I should come back and bring my car paperwork and sit down and go over all the other stuff and he would prepare the tax forms. Well, turns out that a single deduction is more that the two cars worth of tax that I paid and after sitting with this guy for over an hour because he was so slow and could barely type, he figured out that there were no deductions other than the standard single and short form that I could have done for FREE over the internet. First of all, he should have known by looking at my W2 and with no deductions that I should just file on-line through their H&R Block or e-file. After we were finished, he told me that it would be a while before I got my $171.00 back from the IRS minus the $66.00 fee from H&R Block. So, I was expecting to get back $105.00. He asked me if I wanted to pick up the check there and I said no problem if that was easier. What I didn't know is that he was taking out a RAL loan for me and I didn't even know it. I went there to pick up my check on February 13, 2009 and they handed me a check for $55.05. I was floored! I looked at the check and asked what all the fees were for. A $29.95 fee for MY refund account and a $20.00 fee for processing the check. What the heck! Why would anybody in their right mind do a loan in the amount of $49.95 to get $55.05 back. I was shocked that they took my money not to mention the fee of $66.00 was way too much for not having any deductions, property or anything to claim. I felt I was scammed. I asked to speak to the man who prepared my taxes and I told him about the problem. His answer to me was that's too bad, that's the way it is! I was shocked! I called Corporate immediately that day and they gave me a case number and it's been two weeks since. I asked for a refund and haven't received it, no phone calls, no nothing and I am still sitting here with this check for $55.05 that I can't cash because if I do I will acknowledge the Loan Agreement Disclosure on the back of the check. I can't pay my electric bill as a result and now I am going to have a late charge.
Hi - I used the H&R Block premium software to file my 2006 and 2007 taxes. I was sent a notice by the IRS in July 2008 that I filed my stock options incorrectly for tax year 2006. I called several H&R Block offices asking for a second look in the Central Ohio area, and nobody called me back. Therefore, I contacted a tax lawyer who helped me straighten out the errors and I paid the IRS in full. However, as I had also filed 2007 the same way, I wanted a professional to check my return so I could re-file if necessary before the interest got outrageous. Therefore, I finally located one office within 20 miles that was open a few days a week, and I met with tax professional Terri at this Central Ohio location. After waiting over 30 days to hear back from her, I contacted the office and requested the status of my 2007 return. She called me back and indicated I had filed correctly the first time (of which I was dubious). I called again and spoke to another gentleman who seemed more competent who indicated he would review my taxes and get back to me. This was August 2008. I called again in October and November, at this point I just wanted to pick up my papework, and nobody returned my messages. Now, in February 2009, I've gotten another letter for the IRS regarding my 2007 taxes. I've called the office several times, and was told the agent who did the work over the summer would have my paperwork. I spoke to her, and she was more concerned about how I obtained her number than locating my taxes. She went on and on about how convenient it was the local office could hand out her number as needed, but not refer her past clients to her for this tax year. She indicated my paperwork would have remained at the office I visited, but numerous calls to the office and manager have not been returned. I've already requested duplicate W-2's, tuition statements, etc but I've been disgusted with the entire process. I was trying to save myself $ 250/hour by avoiding the tax law firm, but at least they were trustworthy and competent. I've been disgusted by the complete lack of customer concern and ineptness of the many agents and office employees I've spoken with. I will never, ever, do business with H&R Block again, and I'll make sure to share my experience with all my friends and family as we discuss tax time. Completely incompetent. Loss of time and IRS interest payment increase
I needed someone to do a final tax return on my business which was forced to close after 28 years. As I had moved and I was not happy with my previous accountant, I started to look for a new tax preparer. I called the local H&R Block office in 2008 and they told me that Sandy at their Lanoka Harbor NJ office handled business returns but that they were not geared to do returns until after Jan. 1, 2009. On Jan. 4, I called and spoke to Sandra Robbins and she set up an appointment for Jan. 7. I thought it was odd after I got off the phone that she did not tell me what to bring for the meeting, in fact the impression I got was that she was in a hurry to get me off the phone. On Jan. 7, I met with her and brought what paperwork I thought she might need. She identified herself as the owner of the franchise and in fact owned others. Unfortunately thru my error I did not bring one item she needed but I supplied that on Jan.9. I explained that the business was closed down in 2008 and all the remaining assets distributed. She said that time was of the essence so that I would not have to file another return in 2009. Today is Feb. 25 and after numerous phone calls, emails etc. this is not only not resolved but I do not know where this matter stands as she does not return phone calls or emails. As I type this I am am on hold with H&R for over an hour and received an email from her that she does not want to do my return and is returning it by mail. This matter has caused great emotional stress for both my wife and I. I do not know what is going to happen from here as far as expenses, penalties etc. because now I have to begin searching for another preparer to have the return done before Mar. 15.
I used two different H and R block offices. The first office filed my husband's taxes and referred me to another office due to lack of experience for what I needed. (They admitted they had no clue what to do for me.) I had them just to see what my husband's return would be to cross check what I did online. They were able to get about approx. $300.00 more than what I did. Since they are the tax pros. I went with them. About 1 week later I had to go back in to redo the taxes because they were kicked back. (When getting taxes done the lady asked me what my husband's stimulus check was? I advised her that he and I were not married, but it was the amount for a single person with no dependents. She inputted whatever amount it was into the taxes. That was the reason they got kicked back, she put the wrong amount it. So, my husband is getting back approx. $300.00 less then we were. The whole reason for filing with them, they said we were getting more money.) Then I got mine done at a different office. Everything was good. I got an email stating that the refund was sent to my bank on a certain date, if there was a delay it was due to my bank USAA. USAA never received any payment. 4 days later I called the original office back. They advised me that I was due the money no later than the 24th. (Today) Filed on the 10th. I asked to verify my acct and routing number. The last 4 numbers of my acct was taken off. I called USAA back, and they said that it tried going through but the acct number was wrong so they sent it back to HSBC where it came from. HSBC then take up to 72 hrs to get it back and then 24-48 hours to cut a check and send it to H and R block. I asked to get my direct deposit amount back of $29.99, that I paid since it was not going to be direct deposited into my account and some sort of discount on the amount I paid to get my husband's taxes and my taxes prepared by them. I got an I am really sorry about this. So, not only am I waiting more than the 8-15 days for my return for both of them, I am also not getting my direct deposit, which I paid for. My bank USAA does not have an ATM or bank that I am able to deposit the check into. You have to have a scanner. Well, I dont and no one I know does (library either). The foremost reason I paid for direct deposit. I was depending on the refund to come when it was suppose to for my bills. Now, my water was shut off, I have to pay to have my check cashed that H and R block will not pay for (even though it was based on their mistakes}. Ran out of gas to go to work or take my daughter to school. I had no water to water my dogs, my daughter and I to use the bathroom wash our hands, or cook food that needed water. Additional fees to cash check was out of pocket.
The same thing as everyone else, filing my taxes first and then saying that This was how much it costs. Luckily I do have an itemized list of their fees that I snatched out of the managers hand. It was not a confidential form of their office, it was MY PERSONAL comparison of fees added on from last year's tax filing to this years, but the manager would not let me look at the items , and the first chance I got I got a hold of the list proceeding to say it made no sense to me... we were told to give back the paper right away and when refused to do so untill I went over every item & fee they had charged, we were asked to leave instantly. can't believe this has been going on and target at low-income people from 2005!! they should be shut down for good.
H & R charged fees of 340$ and with the RAL fees the total came out to 420$. when going over fees and comparing with years in the past the fees made no sense. I went in there yesterday & asked for a manager, saying that i wanted to cancel it, we sat at the manager's desk (by this time she's very nervous about me questioning things, I also had a witness with me, kept saying our fees have gone up, not our fault, I commented that in Recession how is it possible that fees would jump by 400% in a matter of only two years? she kept beating around the bush not ever giving me a breakdown of what all the fees were for individually. annoyed by this my frustration levels when up & I proceeded to tell her that I wanted a copy of ITemized fees for consumers. she went in her computer and clicked on something, nervously saying that she was making prints to compare this years with last years. when printed and brought to the table, This woman would not let me look at the fees directly, trying every way possible to not let me HOLD ON to the papers. this got me more frustrated and I eventually took the paper from her hand very quickly looking at the fees that had added up to 400+ while tellin my witness to get her calculator out of the car as I got up with all the comparison papers she had printed from 3 years of my tax return. She instantly got up and said please give me the papers back and I said NO I want to go over all this, this makes no sense. she got up ANGRY BY THIS TIME and proceeded to say please give them back now, I will explain it for you, just sit down and I'll go over it for you I said NO and proceeded to look at papers in hand, then she said WELL FINE THEN, be OFF WITH you, I can print more if you won't give them back. then I said yeah you go ahead and do that. she then said well, you got a bigger return this year, which reflects on the fees then my witness got upset by the comment and said yeah, so because she's gotten a bigger refund instead of 2000$ got 4000$ return, this entitles you to a BIGGER CUT? she got very angry at this comment as other clients in the office were looking at us. and very disrespectfully said ok then, bye with you throwing us out of the office. well I left with the papers reflecting fees, and I know any judge would just laugh at it. there are fees for determining status ( who determines my status? them? when I am the one who goes in and says I'm filing head of household nothing has changes from the past 3 years of my filing status) so they're going to come and charge me 25 bucks for that? it gets worse and funnier as you go down the list of and get the feel of the scam. it's not just one or two things, almost more than half of the list is just made up for the show/computer, so I know after going through every one with a judge he will be on my side, I still have time to cancel the RAL that was never even approved in the first place, but on their disclosure notice it says if and when cancelled within 5 days those fees won't apply, however once filed with the IRS we have signed all rights to the HSBC bank & therefor it will still be directed to them from the IRS in which they will deduct the preperation fees before making it available to me. This is Insane. These Crooks are ripping people off everyday and consistently doing so in 2009 as I have been reading all complaints, yet they are still in business and continuing to do so? where's the justice, and how come nobody is doing anything? I am going to small claims to file and sue them for this misconduct. please if anyone can help out I not only wasn't able to get to a very important job interview, but lost a good space I had been on waiting list for my son's school, (they were needing a security deposit which is why I needed the money instantly & willing to take the cut, at the time I filed) there has been long term monetary losses. never will file taxes with these corrupt people
They efiled my sister in law's taxes on 02/07/09 she was charged extra for a quick refund which was supposed to take only 1 to 2 days, kind of a loan. The total fee was $455.22, it turns out that she didn't get a check cut until 02/23/09 and they cut her a check for $761.00 less than what the IRS refunded her. There is several problems with this: 1. Why are they charging 118 dolars to give her the money in 1 to 2 business days when it took 10 business days to cut her a check. 2. She was hit with an additional $20 dollar fee when she picked up the check. 3. There is about 300 dollars that just dissapered and when I went back to the office to ask about this they were rude and insisted everything was fine and tried to get her all confused. I asked for the district manager's information and walked out of there. This morning she received a call from the branch manager saying she didn't have to go to the district manager to go in and she would give her an additional 180 dollars...that still doesn't make up for all the issues listed above. In conclusion, they provided a very bad service and if it had not been because I decited to review her paperwork they would have charged her almost 700 dollars to prepare taxes for someone with only one w-2.
Yearly tax return was made not correctly. As a result I was fined by IRS. H&R block decided that I am entitled for refund. I was waiting for refund half a year and still did not receive it. Receiving multiple run-arounds . Did not received my money back.
I went to H&R block to get help working through the first time home buyer credit for this year. I stupidly did not bother to ask about how much this was going to cost, and they sat down with me and helped me work through the whole tax process, and I thought they were just being nice. At the end I owed them almost 500 dollars. Since I could not pay out of pocket I had them take the money out of the tax return. I was never told that the money goes into their account first, I found out by noticing my routing and account numbers were not on the return. I also didn't know I had to pay 30 dollars to e-file through them. After all of that, I took the time to work through my taxes on my own, and found that they made a couple of mistakes on my return and I was supposed to get 130 more dollars. They were very circular to deal with and I found that they were not an awful lot of people there who knew what they were talking about. Needless to say I reported that branch to my local Better Business Bureau. I'm out 500 dollars and needed to file a tax amendment which may tax up to 12 weeks to work out. Fun.
Me and my husband have ent to h&r block for te past 3 years and have gotten nothing but nice, courtous, reliable service. Well we got married this past year and decided to fil jointly. Well come o find out I had $600 in back taxes that I didn't know about. We file for the load/advancement before christmas and got thier $900 loan, well really $800 b/c of fees and taxes. Well my husband got his w-2's back the 2nd week of january and we had our taxes filed and the irs recieved it by the 16th. We filed for the 1-2 days and couldn't get it b/c I owed money, that was fine. H&R block said they wouldn't charge us for the 1-2 day file, they would charge us for the 8-15 day. Well we didn't get our taxes back until Feb. 13. Before the IRS gave them our money. they took my $600 I owed an dgave the rest to H&R Block. They took out the $901 for the loan/advancement we got before christmas. Well on the 16th they took out another $920.35 for the same loan, well I called the number on the back of the card alittle after 3pm and waited, and waited, and waited! Finally when I did talk to some one, They didn't know what I was talking about and I didn't know what they were talkin about b/c I couldn't understand what they were sayin. So I was put on hold once again. I was on hold from 3 pm to 5:50 pm. When I did finally talk to someone they said yes that is what happened, and said I needed to speak to the disputes center. What is there to dispute? They admitted to me that they took an additional $920.35, but couldn't tell me any thing else. And when I ask to speak to a manager or supervisor I get put on hold or Hung up on. I called back and finally spook to a nice man, who did not put me on hold and undrstood my problem. And told me that it has happened to many more ppl. Plus he said he spoke to his manager and he told him that they were havin all kinds of problems. But the nice representative said he fixed all my paper work and sent it thru and that I should have our money back by friday or before. Well today is sunday and its 2 pm and we still haven't received our money and I am still on hold. I will NEVERgo thru H&R Block again and I will tell everyone I can not to go thru them b/c they are not reliable. I should just have done taxes myselfonline. We don't have our money! Therefore we can not pay or bills. Hopefully me and my 17 month old son don't have to go stay somewhere b/c we get our lightsd shut off b/c we don't have the money, b/c H&R Block took $920.35 out of our account when they already had thier money.
I have been employed by a major railroad since 1994. I started going to H&R Block to have my taxes done because according to the commercials they are the best at getting me back a favorable return. I went in to have my 2008 taxes done and wound up arguing with two female employees over a 1099 misc form. It seems they had no idea how to apply it on my taxes. I explained to them where it was suppose to go according to the IRS publication describing how to file a 1040 tax form and they did not have a clue. I was told they would have to consult a traveling tax expert to see how to do it. The office knew I worked for a major railroad and yet over the years they never even tried to use the deductions I was entitled to. I talked to my union rep who was a cpa on the side and he informed me that H&R Block is the worse place to go to have taxes done because they do not understand the deductions railroad workers are entitled to nor do they even try. In addition to that H&R Block had me file my 2007 taxes as seperate instead of married since I was getting a divorce. I was married the entire year of 2007 and should of filed married. Because of their mistake the IRS said I owed them $2,680.00 in taxes. The IRS withheld the stimulus check of $600.00 from me and applied it to the debt. I told H&R Block to hold off on doing my taxes for 2008 and I picked up all my documents from them. I now have to go to a regular accounting firm to have my tax returns re-done for the years 2005 - 2008 at a cost of $125.00 an hour. I also picked up my now ex-wifes 2007 tax form so that we can have the taxes re-filed as married. According to the ads H&R Block use we are suppose to be happy because we have people. In real life we are not happy because our people, as H&R Block refers to themselves are only out to screw us with their incompetence.
We did our taxes and this year we were getting a very large return due to the first time buyer credit so we opted to take the return in 8-15 days. This would be done through HSBC Bank that H&R Block uses. Our tax guy said that the fund should be there by the 14th. We waited and then I checked the IRS website. It has stated that our funds were transfered into our account on Friday morning. I checked our bank Friday and there was nothing, when I called our local H&R Block location they told me that it was my banks fault and that I could call HSBC at a 888#. I called and found it to be a male on male **** site. When I went to research a little on line I saw all the complaints on here and started to worry. I called our bank first thing Saturday morning and was informed that they had recieved a lot of calls all stating that H&R Block had told people that it was the banks fault and that the refunds were all delayed for some reason from HSBC but it had nothing to do with my bank at all. I then called the local H&R Block location back again and let them know what our bank had said and that the number they were giving out was a **** number. The lady sadi she was sorry and gave me 2 other numbers to call. I called this number and it was to inform you if you had any bad debt with H&R Block or their bank, which we did not. The other [number] after going through the promt I recieved a message that our refund had been released but if there was a delay I needed to contact my bank because the delay would be on their end. H&R Block then came up with the excuse that it is not their fault and that when they say 8-15 days it does not include the day that you filed, weekends, or holidays and the IRS only deposits on Friday so it will be the 1-5 buisness days after that Friday. Okay now I can understand that but I think that needs to be said up front, and when they get the money it should be deposited in our account ASAP not 1-5 buisness days after. I also think that if the IRS releases your money before the loan is recieved then it should no longer be a loan since the money is already in their account. I have used their service for at least 10 years now and this year I didnt want to pay all the huge fees for getting our money in 1-2 days so we thought we can wait 8-15 but if you count out all the weekends and holidays plus the deposit days then really you are waiting just as long as it takes the IRS to deposit it anyway and you can save the fees all together. I think maybe next time we will find a good CPA and have our taxes done worry free. We have had to delay the construction on our home, and through our own fault of counting our eggs before they hatched have had return fees through our bank for bills we had paid since the money was supposed to be there already.
I got my taxes done on 2-2-09 I paid H and R block $372.00 dollars and I picked the option of having my return in 8-15 days. Guess what it has been 18 days and still no refund. So I called them and they gave me the IRS 1-800 number to call because they do not know why my tax return was not deposited on my card yet. They had no refund date or anything to help me. When I called the IRS number they said there was a mistake and they was fixing it. No one wants to take the blame for this. IRS told me I have to wait another week to get my refund and if it did not come next week I would have to call them again. So what happened to me 8-15 days refund I paid for at H and R block?? They took my money and said it was not their fault. IRS said they was reviewing my tax return for accurancy adn that they was a mistake made so what happened why I am screwed out of $372.00 dollars? H and R block are LIERS and they do NOT stand behind you at all. What can I do to get my $372.00 dollars back from them? No money and DO NOT KNOW WHEN OR IF I WILL GET MY REFUND and if I even get the correct amount. I have two young children to take care of. I am a single mother.
This is the worst service ever from appointment down to the supervisor Ms. Ferguson. I called to make my appointment over the phone and one of the representatives took all my information; name, social security number and phone number telling me our appointment was schedule and to come in at the appointment time. So I get to the office and there was no appointment in system, the staff acted as if they didn't know what they were doing. So I advised the young lady at the front desk I have taxes which requires a exceptional representative and instead of giving me what I ask for she put me with someone who didn't know what they where doing. I than asked for supervisor and the representative stated she not in the office yet, after waiting for the supervisor Ms. Ferguson for over an hour never being available. The representative finally find someone there who has more experience after processing the paper work which all was messed up and now have to owe and be amended. The supervisor than come in the office late I explained the situation to her she states she going to take care of the problem. First she never calls me but has someone else call to tell me I cant get a refund for the poor service. Than I contentiously call the store leaving messages she never calls me back. After a weeks worth of trying to get in touch with her, she sides with her staff stating that I never told this information to them, when I know I definitely did, I wouldn't just make this up, I came there for a professional service and got garbage. I had to remind her that she we wasn't there in the store to to address any of the issue anyway. I would no advised anyone to go there ever in life or you will definably be screwed in the process. DON'T DO IT TO YOURSELF! TRUST ME! I'M IN PROCESS NOW WITH REPORTING THEM TO THE HOME OFFICE! Taxes wrong, penalties and owing money. Now need a lawyer!
I am completely disappointed in the service I received with H&R Block. My Consultant had to be told SEVERAL times about deductions I wanted to take out on my return, handled my case completely carelessly and flippant and then handed me a bill for $260. Was it worth the headache? Absolutely not. Sadly, up to this point, I had been a return customer of Block. But after this experience, I've told everyone I know what a ripoff this company seems to be. I will NEVER be returning as a client.
I am a young mother and college student, and recently married. My husband and I have a tight budget, so this tax season I wanted to get all the deductions I could. We took our W-2's and all of our receipts- child care, student loans, tuition paid,etc.-into H&R Block to have them done, thinking it would cost about $180, but at least they would be quick. When I sat down, I gave all my forms to the tax preparer, and she proceded to file our taxes in about 25 minutes. At the end she said, This is your fee for tax preparation today. I looked at her screen and it said $322!!! I could not BELIEVE it. We only received a $2,000 return, and we are a family of three w/ a combined income of $32,000. Why in the world would they charge so much?! I called the office later with my complaint and they said they now charge for every piece of paper you hand the tax preparer. I brought in those receipts to save money, not to pay some one to look at them. It only takes 2 seconds to enter a dollar amount in a blank. I have never heard of that before. Well, I had $180 set aside for tax preparation, but ended up tapping into my next two weeks grocery money that should be going to feed my son. It's not right. I live paycheck to paycheck.
H&R Block is a joke. We went and filed our taxes on 2/02/09. It has been three weeks, and still no money. We had our back taxes checked over, and thought that it was only a $29.00 fee. We then were told that it was $110.00 fee after they had already checked them, and we had to mail them out. So they did our taxes for this year, and our grand total to pay them was $450.00! What? We did the same return last year and only paid $100.00 with another person. So we opted for the 8-15 day return since our fees were already outrageous. After 15 days had passed, we started calling and asking about our return, and were our money was. They have told us that the IRS was reviewing our return, but I checked the IRS website and it stated that the money was released. Today we recieved an email that our money was direct deposited, but no money is in our account. So today we went to H&R Block, and they said it might take a few more days because they need to take out their fees. So why are they saying that the money has been deposited when it certainly has not?! I have officially been on the phone for an hour and a half trying to get a hold of a manager, and here I sit still on hold. Does anyone know who I can file a complaint with other then H&R Block? This company is a fraud, and they are liars. I think that they should have to hold up to there promise to have my money within 15 days, for the amount of money we paid out. We have bills that need to be paid, and we were relying on this money in order to pay them, and this company is jerking us around. I will NEVER use H&R Blocks service ever again and I WILL NOT recommend any of their services to anyone! Behind on bills. Overpaid for a simple tax return.
i've been with H&R Blk for yrs. always go to same individual and felt she was VERY knowlegeable my experience this year was that i got SCAMMED! not her fault but the fault of H&R's new structure this yr. my form was ONLY 3 pages. it cost me approx $45 dollars MORE than in the past and in the past i had 5 pages. and these are the reasons i was given for the EXTRA charge: - my appointment was scheduled during prime time of month. i've NEVER been told there was a prime time of month and my appointments are ALWAYS with the same individual in the same office. SHE calls me & makes my appoint's avail. this yr i saw her 4 FEB. - I received a FREE $20 discount coupon last yr. i used it. now this yr THEY consider me a NEW CLIENT and charge me an EXTRA $20 because of that even though my last 6 yrs info is ON their computer! - AND i was told that even though i only GOT 3 pages that there were hidden pgs that i was charged for. one was supposedly for my Soc Sec. hey! i've been on soc. sec for 6 (six) YEARS! therefore, IF there is a HIDDEN form, then it should have been in my charges before! one was supposedly because the Gov. allowed us to have a deduction for our Prop. TAXES. (Gov gives me a deduction and H&R Blk charges me for a HIDDEN FORM to get it? something isn't right) well that's my experience. i was SCAMMED by H&R Blk for approx $45.00. i've been a LONG time customer. but when SCAMMED i don't give ya a second chance! this was WRONG
My taxpreparer Sandy is awesome! It is the charge that is terrible. I had to pay $293.00 to have my taxes done this year and $165.00 last year. I only make under $25,000.00 a year. I feel H&R Block charges way too much especially during the recession. 1/2 my wages paid for tax prep. That in itself causes more issues. Bills wont get paid and food will not be bought.
i did my taxes with h&r block they stated to me if i paid an additional 13 dollars i could have a rac refund and recieve my state check in 8 to 13 days. they never told me business days but i waited, 13 buisness day past no check i contacted them and now they tell me 15 days i waited once again. 15 days go by still no check. now i call them they give me an 800 number which is usless because the state doesnt give out information on the status of a check untill 30 days upon filling. i call h&r and ask for a refund of my 13 dollars because they lied to me, the receptionist said well that could take up to six weeks. now i am sitting here with no state refund and i will have to fight to get my 13 dollars back. i dont think it is fair when the put something in writing i pay for it and nothing. i was going to use the money to pay my car payment which is 3 months past due due to econmic hard times i need my car to drive my 3 children to school. now my car will probally be taken away.
Tax Cut offers Simple Pay for tax refunds that are e-filed. They lead me to believe a deposit account would be open to deposit the fee's for filing. The cost of the Tax Cut software and an additional $30.00 for using Simple Pay. The total was $99.00 and I was agreeable to the cost. However, they lead the customer to believe the filing fee is deposited in the H&R block account and the remainder of the refund goes to the customers designated deposit account. That is not how it works!!! I expected my refund today and imagine my surprise when the funds were not there. When I contacted H&R Block they said ALL OF MY REFUND was deposited to their bank and they will deposit the refund (minus their fees) to my dda within 8 - 15 days. Unacceptable!!! How convenient their H&R Block bank receives all of these tax refunds and draws interest on them until they decide to release the funds. I have used H&R Block to do my taxes for the past five years. This will be my last year with their company and I advise others not to purchase their software.
I made $19k last year. I asked them how much they charge. She said it depends on how many forms they use. After 45 minutes my bill was $648.00! I asked them for a Ala Carte menu of the forms and how much they charge for each and they would not give it to me. I paid $648.00! They owe me an itemized bill at the very least! Even if they used every form in their arsenal, it should not have costed $648.00. I could have gone to a CPA for half that. What can I do to get my money back? Or at least knock off $300? Well for starters I won't have quite enough for my mortage payment. I'll probably start drinking heavily from this experience. I feel extremely upset! $648is a lot of money! I only made $19k last year. I can not afford an attorney. So if you are an attorney that needs to get paid, You will have to get it from H&R Block. I am tapped out...
I had my taxes to be done by HRA this year, because it's free, volunteers help do your taxes. I wasn't sure of the amount I was getting back so I brought my already done tax form to H & R block to have the second look done for $30. They found about $655 due to child care expenses. So they were to file an amended form to get me the $655. I thought wow that's great...but then they told me their fees would total $312. So they basically wanted half my money. What a rip off! I said no. I returned to HRA and they sent in an amended form for me and I didn't have to pay anything. H & R Block really charges you for things you can do yourself or get help doing for free. No consequences, but they should be investigated. I don't think any of their accountants really are that...they never seem to know what they're doing, always asking others for help. I suggest no one use them, they will over charge you!
I had my taxes screwed up the man did not enter in my EIN correctly nor my correct address so i was not notified about the descrepancy. When I do find out that the IRS wont accept my return i call and they re-submit. Well i payed for the piece of mind plan. I still have to wait another 15 days for my return if it is accepted. Nor have they offered to refund the 400 dollars i payed for the service. I was relying on the money to pay my bills. Now i am going to be lucky if I have the money to cover my basic needs.
Two days ago I called our local H and R block office in town. I have had my taxes done with them for some 13 years now, but like many people at this time could not afford to pay all the fees. I thought I remembered a time when they would (for a fee) double check a self prepared return and (for another fee) e file your return. I asked and explained three times to the woman on the phone what services I was looking for and was told yes finally that I could get those services in their office. When I showed up with my paperwork I again explained what I wanted to do. The preparer basically did my return as normal and informed me that yes I had done my return correctly. At this time we again discussed what I wanted to do, the preparer turned to a woman behind her at another cubical to discuss the proper computer codes and the other woman in the office (I believe it was the manager) said they don't do that and inquired as to who I talked to. Funny thing it was her! Not only did she deni what services she told me they provided she neglected to tell me that I could have efiled my return through their web site at a much lower cost. I will never again do buisness with H and R block nor will I ever recommend to anyone I know to use their services. My mother had her return done with a local tax office in town and got the same services as me for $100 I on the other hand trying to stay with the company I have always used paid $250. Next time I have any questions about loyalty to a corporate entity I will remember this incident and check loyalty at the door and stick with small buisness. I honestly feel as if H and R block commited fraud and certainly did not inform this once long time and loyal customer of all my options. BEWARE!
The short version is as follows: This year our taxes were more complicated than usual due to my husband's recent deployment and us having to file married filing jointly in 2 different states. I made the BIG MISTAKE of going to H&R Block for tax prep. Not only did the quoted price for the service increase from between $100 and $200 to $479, but we were told we had to pay up front instead of having the fees taken out of our refund as originally we had been led to believe. Our refund is to be $7, 372!! We didn't have this kind of money to spend, so we had to borrow the money to pay their fees so they would hit the send button for federal e-file. When, 2 days later, I returned with their money so they could actually file our taxes, I watched them send them off and a CAUTION sign appeared on the screen. After some debate, I conviced the preparer to let me see what that caution had been about, it said, basically, that a delay or denial of refund could occur due to the filing of form 8379. This form was not supposed to be filed. They were supposed to file a NC Innocent Spouse form, and what they did was file a Federal Injured Spouse form. There is a big difference! When I asked them to fix this, they told me to not worry, it wouldn't matter, and come back if I hadn't received my refund in 12 days. 14 days later I hadn't received the money, so I returned to the office; they looked at the computer and told me that the IRS had deposited my money 10 days ago and that my bank was holding up the direct deposit. I then called my bank and found that this wasn't true in any way. I returned to the office and spoke to a new person whom I hadn't seen before. She looked at them computer and told me that according to the IRS, my refund would be delayed from 12 weeks to 6 months due to the filing of this form and the only person who could help was C. Rizzuto, the Office Manager, and she was at home not reachable until the next day. I went in the next day, this morning, in fact, and J. Rueff, my original preparer who had goofed, was in on his day off speaking with the IRS on my behalf. Unfortunately, it is too late for anything to be done, according to the IRS, except file an amended return and wait a minimum of 12 weeks for that to process. C. Rizutto, the Office Manager, (when she finally agreed to see me) first told me, I might can get you 100 bucks. I was flabbergasted. I told her that I had paid their peace of mind fee and that they were supposed to help me. She told me that only applied to an audit and they were under no more obligation to me whatsoever because they filed my taxes, which is what I paid them to do. After I told her I wanted a full refund of the $479 I originally paid, she told me that would happen under no circumstances. I asked could she do something with their RAL program to help me until this was resolved, and she said that wasn't an option. She refused to give me her supervisor's name, and the receptionist says that only the Office Manager can give out that information. After a long debate which got nowhere, I was asked to leave because there were other customers who needed to be served. For the record, I never once used foul language (not that I wasn't thinking it). I called 1-800-HRBLOCK. They were sympathetic, but told me each individual office was an independent franchise and all they could do for me was file a complaint against that office, which, in all honesty, they said, might never be addressed. That customer service representative gave me another phone number for the Branch Office Technical Support to see if they could help me. Again, the gentleman was very sympathetic and agreed to file a statement. He also told me that the H&R Block employees are all well aware that THEY COULD HAVE FIXED THE PROBLEM ON THE FIRST DAY THE RETURN WAS FILED BY CALLING HIM! The reason they can't fix it now is because they waited too long. He said all I could do was to file an amended return, which I will probably have to end up paying someone else to do because they refuse to stand behind their service or their guarantees. 1. I had to take out a loan to pay their filing fees; the only reason I had to pay the fees up front, I later found out, was because of the form being filed which they erroneously filed. 2. Due to a recent military move and the government being behind on reimbursement disbursments, we are in serious danger of getting behind on rent, having utilities shut off, and not being able to pay for basic necessities, not to mention the potential damage to our credit. We have 2 children and this is unacceptable. This refund was to be our lifeline and H&R Block in one push of a button has put the money we desperately needed to stay afloat out of reach for months. I do work, for the record; it isn't that we don't try to pay everything on time; we usually do, we just got behind due to a required military move. 3. I recently broke a tooth and found out I need extensive dental work to repair the damage, not for cosmetic reasons, but to avoid having further problems arise. I can now not afford my co-pay portion of the bill and can't have the work done until I receive the money.
Had measly $475.00 tax refund, H&R Block took $30.00 prepare, $195.00 to make sure I had refund in 2 days - never received refund - called every day - once when called they said they would refund all service charges - still no$ - then called again and they said I had $193.50 and it was the IRS' fault and needed to call them...hmm - what was my $200.00 service fees for? I called them again this evening and they said use your 'Emerald Card' and you will have your $193.00. I said what about all the service fees you charged me because I needed my $193.00 right away? they said you need to call the IRS, they will explain everything. I thought H&R Block was supposed to be on my side? They are STILL CHARGING ME $200.00 service fees and blaming the IRS - I asked for a refund and they said No, the IRS is auditing you - I THOUGHT THEY (h&r BLOCK) WAS SUPPOSED TO BE PROTECTING ME? WHAT THE HELL DID I GIVE THEM $200.00 FOR? THEY WILL NOT REFUND MY $ FOR FILING FOR A 1-2 DAY REFUND -
I usually file my taxes online for free but this year I had someone whom I could claim as a dependent. So I decided that maybe I should have a professional do it for me. WOW was I wrong! First of all I walked into H&R Block on Harrison and Cooper Point RD in Olympia and found out that someone had the chance of going home early. So they were flipping a coin to see who had to help me! Then I got IRA or whatever his name was and boy did he sound excited to help me. Anyway we went through all the blah blah it was time to see what my refund was going to be! Drums roll please........ a whole 399.00! Ok so ya I made over 24,000 last year and he was telling me that the only reason im getting 399.00 is because I get the other 300.00 from the stimulis check that I didnt receive the full amount of. If I was now eligable for the other 300.00 my tax return would have been a whole wooping 99.00! Then he wanted to charge me 50.00 just to do my taxes!!!!! Well I decided to go back and do it myself online like I have in the last year. And BAM 1200.00 is my return! Huge difference! In 2007 I didnt make as much as I did in 2008 but last year I got like 700.00 for my tax return!!!! DONT GO TO H&R BLOCK oh and after I said that I was going to file myself online, He asked me Well can I keep a copy of your taxes just in case? I CANT BELIEVE HIM Well I decided to not file my taxes with H&R Block and I decided to file myself online.
They made mistakes on my tax return and overcharged me. It wasn't until i called them for several days that anything was done. Even after they admited to making the mistakes they have not corrected them. I feel cheated and taken advantage of. I have also been trying to check the status of my return and have come to no avail. It has been more than two weeks. I filed for a rapid return. They seem to have no answers. According to another tax company, I am about 1200.00 short of what I should have recieved.
After filing w/one of Polly's agents and having to Refile our taxes due to error(s) made by her a new employee- #000587/office #22852) and not being able to get tax info from this office we called the Owner-Polly. She said you always get one bad apple in the bunch and this employee was let go as well as the person that hired her. she agreed to refund the $250 my wife and I paid for a short form that took the agent 2 1/2 hours to complete. Even upon our insistence we had enough deductions for long from due numerous medical expenses,no insurance and a 2yr old child. We have called Polly at least 9 times and will not return any more calls. I said I'd rather deal w/her rather than go to her boss but she said that the complaint would only LAND ON HE DESK ANYWAYS! Lost job time. We borrowed money for bills, grocieries etc. Now we are behind on other payments because they didn't tell us that filing injured spouse would take longer. We are amending w/DIFFERENT tax prep. and havent' paid him yet.
I went to have my taxes done. Told her my household situation and asked her to figure my taxes both ways to see if I should claim my granddaughter or my daughter should. We were both 50/50 on support. She told me to put her on mine and when they come in if it is more she could just refile mine and let them claim her. Two days later she tells my daughter I would have to file an ammended return and pay more money. I already paid over two hundred dollars. She also said even if I file an ammended return they will have to send their return by mail and they probably wont let them claim her since I already did even though it was ammended. Supervisor Janet says Nancy tells a different story and she is one of their best agents. She offered to help resolve it as long as we pay more money. I have used them since 2002 at different locations but this location I feel like I got scammed. We are out alot more money and have to wait a much longer time to recieve a refund because of withheld information.
I have used H&R Block every year for my taxes, faithfully. My father went there for year, so when it was time to file my own, naturally, I went to them. For the past two years my husband and I have deposited money into Traditional IRA accounts through H&R Block. When we were first offered the IRA, it sounded great. We were fooled. It and H&R Block is just a rip off. Now, we only put the minnimum into our accounts each year, but that meant that this year we had $600 ea. in our accounts plus any interest earned. We didnt earn any interest. I was dissatisfied, so I decided to withdraw the money. I opted to pay an additional fee to have my money overnighted. This occured on Feb. 6th 2009. Papers were faxed, everything was in order. I was told my check would be at my house on Monday. I have yet to recieve a check. Today is Feb 17th. When I call, I am on hold for hours at a time. A supervisor is never available, but yet the customer service people cannot help me. Everytime I call, its seems as though the people are unwilling to help and I have only encountered a few that actually did. Two very nice women to be exact. My check was mailed to the complete wrong address. Apparently it was cashed. They cannot tell me where it was cashed or even when. They wont send me a copy of the cleared check so that I can see the signature. They simply tell me that they dont know what happened. I have even been hung up on several times. They told me to file a claim with the fraud department. They admitted that all of this was their fault. They said it was their people that had messed up and didnt follow protocol. Yet, I am the one that is out of money and that has to suffer. Its insane. I advise against opening an IRA. I was told that my fraud claim would take 6 months to investigate. My loss. I guess I should have known better. H&R Block has forever lost my business. Next time I will do better research when opening an investment such as that! I needed this money. Now im out of the money and H&R Block has refused to help me. I can't imagine that I am the first, how many more people have they done this to?
I was under a time crunch after losing my job and had to go to Buffalo from Brooklyn to gt a couple of my w2's. When I did my taxes last year it was 57.00 and took less than two weeks. I didn't know where to go in short notice back in Brooklyn and for some unbeknown reason to me, everyone says go to HR. Well let me tell you after not being briefed on a single price and assuming that all taxes cost the same unless you own a business or have billions of dollars I learned that making under 20g a year and doing everything the same I did last year this woman pulled out more forms that I could fathom and in the end it totaled 238.00 TO FILE! I said, how on earth and she kinda squimed, I didn't have time, I had to move and make a down payment at the end of the month... So I say whatever... If I wait I will be homeless just do direct deposit, oh ANOTHER 30.00!? Awesome... so it costs money to do something for free. Aparently she said it goes through another bank account and that's their fee. So you have a loop hole now where they for no reason can take more money, great. All in all, it's been over two weeks and cost me about 267.00. I looked over my papers, it's a joke. I will never use them again, poor upfront communication, false pretense, rediculous charges and no way to call, contact, complain, follow up with a horrible customer service. I feel bad after the whole experience and broke.
I will never trust H R Block again. I had my returns done by Donna on Jan 16th. When I received my final refund it was 135.00 less than it was suppose to be. I called Donna about it and she said she did not know what happened. After research, I found that she had made a mistake filing the stimulus and the IRS did and adjustment. She told me it was not her fault I told her the wrong amount. I remember telling her she needed to make sure before filing. I ask to speak to her manager and both of them told me it was my fault they called me and the IRS a liar and said I would not be refunded any fees. H R Block does not stand behind what they do, all they do is take your money for them and their bank. They refused to admit they made a mistake and their mistake cost me their 110.00 fee, the 29.99 fee for their bank and the 135.00 the IRS took extra because of their mistake. The manager told me my returns were done perfectly WELL if it was perfect why did the IRS do an adjustment and I got less money. I lost 2 hrs from work plus I was called a liar by h r block
we where to get are taxs back in 8 to 15 days we filed on jan.29 and today is feb. 17 we still don't have are money
H&R Block incompetent to file simple 1040A for naive taxpayers. I just learned of this. I'm filing it on behalf of my daughter, who apparently assumed H&R Block was competent. My daughter & husband filed their 1040A through H&R Block in 2006. H&R left out information from one W-2 in H&R's possession and the refund that came and went was followed a year later by an IRS notification of taxes (rightly) owed. When they informed H&R, H&R acknowledged that they had a copy of the W2 ..in our folder and were liable for the interest, which they paid. Quotes from H&R form 2228, region 53, Admin ID Major, dated 9/15/2008. The kids paid for tax prep services but not the additional $50 fee (POM) for H&R to actually do the taxes right or pay the consequences (with much small print). They paid H&R to file based on the information in H&R's possession, which H&R did incorrectly, on a brain-dead simple 1040A. Why should they not return all fees associated with a flawed return prepared by them? Tax notification and extended payment plan and record of same now in my daughter's name.
Well On Feb 2...09 Me and my husband went to go file our taxes.....we did the 8-14 days and we payed $290.00 to file....ridiculous by the way! It is now Feb 16...and I still have not got my money.....I just called H&R Block and they told me my money was deposited on Feb 13th, which it wasnt..... I am never going back to them ever again! this is Bull, due to the refund being late, I am now late on my bills!
I went to consulted about my taxes and I explain to her like that when we realized she had all the paperwork done and with actitud ask me to signed and I tell her that a just want a consultation she told that my taxes were completed and if don't wanted I have to pay 30.00 and we decided to do the taxes with her we pay 300 dollars for the everyting she promised that we will have my money last thursday 12th but I only got one for 500 and everytime I call h&r block they tell me difference things I need help please 3,700 that I need because iam unemployee and iam a single mother
On February 10, 2009 my boyfriend and I had our taxes done. Both of us did the short forms as our income was not enough to do the long form. I am retired but did earn some extra income other than my social security which came to an income for 2008 of $10,453. I was shocked when I was charged $143 to have my taxes done and another $29 fee since I was not able to pay for tax preparation up front. My boyfriend is disabled and his income for 2008 was $8,036 and was also shocked that he was charged $188. He does not receive any money back as he owes the IRS and state for back taxes, so he went more in the hole. At least I receive some money back for federal and state, however, it would have been much better to have lower fees to charged to me so that my return would be much better. We attempted to get the fees lowered due to our income states but nothing happened. We had our taxes done in 2007 for the years of(2006 and 2007) and felt the fees were a little higher than we expected but went ahead with the process. Since the computer calculates all the information inputed by the tax preparer, how can they charge these outrageous fees. For 2009 I do not intend to go back to H&R Block as my only income will be my social security and will not need to file Federal taxes (according to what I was told). My boyfriend will not be back also and will be going to get his taxes done by the IRS (which I understand is free). I do not understand why the fees are not disclosed to the consumer before they are prepared......I am under the impression that most other tax services give you the rates up front. We know we will never go back to H&R Block. A verbal complaint has been made to the location where the taxes were performed, however, we do not expect any further response. We went to H&R Block as I know the tax preparer personally and entrusted him to be fair this year with the rates charged.......boy was I ever wrong. I feel also that all the stupid constant H&R Block advertising on TV is something that I paid for in my fees charged.
Went to HR Block 2/5/09 spent 2 hrs before I realized it and thought everything was done. Went in on Friday 02/06/09 had to restart taxes another hour and took option of rapid refund said check would be ther by the 7th on the 7th no one contacted me so I called them. They informed me that information was put in system 3 times and last name and ss numbers were entered wrong and it would be taken care of . The first rep was an lousy untrained rep named Susan and I don't know her name. The second rep was another lousy rep named Kristen A. Finally I talked to manager, she could do nothing, called regional manager Marc he assured me that he would have check by Sunday and he would call. I called evey hour on the hour and no check it was not until that later that I was told he was not available and nothing could be done. Still no taxes. Filed numerous complaints with 800 number 2 hours on phone claimed no corporate headquarters, found corporate number they could not help it was just an endless bundle of mess. I kept trying to contact the Regional manager Mark since he was the biggest liar of them all but he refused calls and assistant got short and curt with me on the telephone stating "he is taking the 80 rapid refund charge off as if this was a big deal I cant be charged since i did not receive it. I demanded my full refund because they screwed up and they said they will give it to me but I won't get hopes up heck I haven't received check yet. In my opinion HR Block has no integrity left and they are cheating the people out of their money. I hope they go belly up like the rest of these big companies and suffer great losses. Management is terrible, workers are worse and 800 number is a joke. Corporate is suppose to help, but they are crooked too, they set up these independent franchises so they don't have to bear any financial responsibility. I would never want anyone to use my name if they were not on the up and up but I guess as long as money is pouring in they dont care. I dont know if it will do any good but if anyone is interested I am listing the corporation telephone number, maybe if they receive enough calls they will do something or either change their number and make it more difficult to find. Also I am contacting the BBB to file a complaint so that it is registered. It may not help me but if complaints are coming in rapidly something will eventually be done. We need to do something instead of complain, file complaints.
I went in on Jan 31st to get my taxes done, although I normally use the free or basic online software, there was a new piece of paperwork I had this year, that had me stumped, and was not well explained. First off I noticed I could barely understand our tax professional Dora, and had to repeat most things twice to her, as well as having to ask her what she said or meant several times. I also had to correct her on many boxes skipped or entered incorrectly(for example, line 14 on the W2's was skipped, and State ID's were put in as EIN's). To top it off, neither her NOR the manager had ever heard of the form I had, and had to call someone else to help explain several of the lines. To top it off, they still entered the information incorrectly(after 30+ minutes of waiting for the manager to get around to us), and I myself noticed what might be wrong, asked them, and then they *got* it, and said I was correct. I left feeling quite cheated out of my $351, but it was late, so I didn't go over my forms before leaving. After I got home, I noticed things didn't LOOK right. And I was not given a reason for the expense of my tax preparation, especially since I had pretty much figured out my own problem. The more I went over it, the more it bothered me, so I went in the following day, and Naomi appeared, and stated that she was surprised at how my folder was put together wrong. So she sat down with me(another hour of my time and finding a babysitter for our 5 children, on top of the 2.5 we had spent in there previously), had me file a complaint, in the form of a letter to the manager(which I wrote while there) and said that we needed to file an amendment, but SHE wasn't allowed to do it, but she would have the manager (Catherine) call me. Well, I didn't get a call, so I called, and they gave me the run around saying that she wasn't in, they didn't know when she would be, etc. The next time I called, they said she HAD been in the day I called originally, and they would leave another note for her, to call me. Still no call. So I went in again Sat the 7th, and low and behold Catherine WAS in, however, she refused to speak to me. The reason given was that she had been promoted to an area manager and no longer did taxes, and Naomi was going to have to be the one to take my case and ammend it (even though they wouldn't let her the previous Sunday). Naomi followed the suit of everyone else and said she would go over it and call me in the next few days because she was swamped with so many clients the next 3 days, leaving me feeling put off once more. So when I got home I called and demanded another appt. Which I got for Tuesday the 10th. We went over everything for over an hour(more babysitting for my kids), finding many mistakes, but it didn't change my refund amount, and the state wouldn't notice that we had moved and moved back so she decided that filing an amendment would be pointless. She also could not show me why it cost me so much. I will NEVER, EVER use H&R block again, and I now my parents won't be using them again, b/c of this. The incompetance of the original tax assistant, followed by the lack of caring since they already had my money. And the manager wouldn't even step up to the plate and talk to me. Shameful and disturbing. We had to find a babysitter for our 5 small children on 3 different occasions, for over 5 hours total, because of the incompetance of the original lady, plus the $350 it cost to get them done which was supposed to go towards next years schooling for my children. Not to mention the stress on a 7.5 months pregnant woman, to have to be having to do all the work and pay for it.
When I filed my federal taxes at H&R Block I opted for my return to be placed on one of their emerald green cards I was thrilled to know that I would have the money in 1-2 business days. The next day I checked over the phone for the balance on the card and was again thrilled to hear that my money was on the card and the card was ready to use. The problem came on the 2nd day when I went to the gas station to make a small purchase and the card that H&R block had provided me with was denied twice. There should have been approximately $500 still on the card but it was being denied for a $7 purchase. After calling the phone number on the back of the card and sitting on hold for an hour and a half I spoke to 3 different people who both apologized but said that there isn't anything they are able to do until the bank opens again on February 16th. Since the money was placed on the card and I didn't have any trust issues with them I didn't take all the money off at once and now I am going to have to overdraft my bank account because I have to be able to go to work. I am also being forced to place my plans on hold until they can figure out what exactly is going on with my money. Since I live in a fairly small town I was expecting to be able to make a trip to a larger city to make some purchases and now I am unable to do what I need to on my days off because this.
I filed my income taxes two weeks ago, and was told I would get my check in 8 to 15 days. Now they it will be two more weeks . No explanation except that they can't help when the IRS MAILS IT.
Have been using Taxcut to do my taxes for many years. Purchased the '08 version, which states you need system 10.4 or greater for Macs on the box, which I have. I load the product, which won't work, stating I need system 10.4.11. This was not listed on the box. I feel angry that they lied on the box. How many people are going to buy this program, only to not be able to use it. My computer is only 3 years old! Taxcut will refund my $45, but its going to take 4-6 weeks. And I have no way of doing my taxes.
upon having our taxes prepared by michelle we told her she was making a mistake all she could say was she was tired and would explain later we went back the next day and pointed out her mistake to another preparer would fix an addmendment for us also contacted the manager would refunded our prep fee but we are have to wait for $1000 and worry about emerald advance loans being paid on time makes us wonder out of the last 20 years of doing our taxes how many other times were they wrong the $1000 mistake michelle made will cost us several $ in interest fees on several differant accounts and loseing the home we were going to move to since our current landload is being forclosed on homeless is not what we were seeing tax refund doing for us
My son is on active duty with the US Army and is currently based at Ft. Bliss, TX. He was just charged an extra $75.00 fee at the on base office of H & R Block to file his tax return in CA. They also charged him $40.00 to process the federal tax EZform. His military pay is so low that he would qualify for food stamps if he weren't in the military! This extra fee is outrageous and unfair.
filed rapid file with h&r, on jan,20, 2009for the prevoius year. filed rapid, two day, but credit was refused, so it went to 8-15 days. irs shows my refund of 7026.00 was deposited to hsbc financial institution, as of feb, the 5th my 15 days was up. i repeatedly called and left messages, never once did they call me back as to why i8 didnj't have my refund as late as feb 13. irs shows the deposit to hsbc on jan 30, the people at thyis store are rude and very non caring about their clients, as of feb 13th, after i called tonya the district supervisor, was then told oh yes, she meant to call me and let me know, the bank had sent my check back to irs, due to an identity fraud question.now i have the tracking info thanks to irs, and have been told by them, not to even contact these folks again. i'm quite sure now if there was a question, it was an err0or, cause i am who i say i am, and irs knows i'm hunting for my refund that these folks have been holding. it was tracked to them, so now i will have irs, if it's sent back to direct deposit it into my savings, and h and r can kiss any feees goodgye, and i deal with many people daily and word of mouth can influence bad bussiness's lost my apt, waiting on this money, now i must restart, H & r did not do any of the things, they claim to, no one returned my calls, i did the tracking , they wouldn't bother, now,went to jackson hewitt for years, gave you a try this year, since to9nya the supervisor does my payroll, so after 3 years i woul;d assume she knows i'm who i say i am, but evidently, no one in offices do any checking or even talk9ing to the customer, cause i could have easily shown my social number is mine and has been all my 59 ye4ars, and even at that, why did i have to be the one to track it, what are they there for?
I often do my taxes online free. Last year H&R Block lured me back with a great coupon for 50% of tax preperation. Grand total 50 dollars.I had such a positive experiance I went ahead and made this years appointment with the same preparer. I was concerned since I did not get the same coupon offered to me this year I asked ahead of time how much they charge. I told the lady I can do my own taxes at home for free. I was told the flat fee is 77.oo dollars and forms needed will increase the base amount. Confident that my taxes would be the same as last year I went ahead with the appointment. I can do the math 100 to 150.00 dollars max right? Wrong. Same place same forms this year cost a grand total of 229.00! I will never return I told this lady that I was NOT happy and I would NOT return. She didn't care!
Went to H&R and they wanted to know how much stimulas money I got. I told them; they put it aside and said the IRS wants to know how much everyone got and if they were intitled to get more. The Money amount I told them was explained that I would get it back in about two weeks well I got my taxes done on January 30, 2008 and it is now Feburary 14,2009; Where is it at? I also told them I would take a paper check through the mail to avoid the $9.21 charge for my State refund; well I got charged anyways. I have been going to H&R for a few years; but NOT anymore. This is the LAST year I will be taken advantage of. Also, I made twice as much money this year; but the refund didn't seem to balance. I was told if any errors where found they would fix it and my refund would be corrected. You just can't trust people no more; even with a well known name.
This is in response to the many who have had a bad experience with H&R Block...those tax Professionals are you and me not some college graduate who has a background in bookeeping or numbers, their training is lackluster at best and what you is not what you paid for they are trained to sell you product at any cost, pay your $143 and you too could become a Block employee....no background checks no employer references checked just pay and become a Tax Pro!
I followed the link to HR Block Taxcut from the IRS website for free filing. Taxcut's link on the IRS website states that it is free if you are under 50 and your income is less than $56,000. I clicked the link and completed the free file federal return and when I tried to file, I was asked to pay $14.95. The online help stated that the free return if for 1040EZ only and the charge was because I had deductions. This is not stated on the IRS website or the HR Block website. Very deceptive and dishonest. A lot of time and wasted completing a return that I will not file due to their deceptive charges.
I did my own taxes using the free TaxCut online service. I have used H&R Block for 12 years, without problem...of course that was in office paying their fees. Having gotten te Emerald Card last year, I chose to have my refund deposited onto the MASTERCARD this year. Here is everything I'v been through since the IRS confirmed my refund funds were released Thursday, February 5th at midnight. 8/6/2009 1. Customer service rep who said it would go on card between 7pm and midnight EST 2. Customer service rep, refused to let me speak with supervisor and transferred me to an automated line 3. Customer service rep transferred me to a supervisor AGT2914 Supervisor then said she could not help but would transfer me to the department above her who could Was on hold for 41 minutes and 37 second, then was hung up on when company closed for the night at 1am EST 4. Tried calling back two times, not knowing company was closed, and was charged $2.00 each time for the automated system to hang up on me. TAX CUT ONLINE SERVICES Ref# RES4978376 Customer Service Rep AGT# 510221 No help, was referred either back to Emerald Card or HSBC Bank 8/7/2009 1. Representative told me I was computer illiterate and needed someone else to look over information. Was then told that either myself or the IRS had done something wrong and would need to fix through them. H&R Block District Office, Vancouver WA 1. Spoke with R. McNaley, who was unable to help me at the time but was also so professional a assuring that it helped calm me down. Thought that the deposit would surely go through Monday or Tuesday and was anxious to hear back from me that a resolution was found. 8/9/2009 IRS SERVICES Verified all information with IRS, including routing number and account number of direct deposit. Verified that the funds had been released from IRS to H&R Block Bank on Thursday, February 5th evening to ensure deposit the following day. Was told if no deposit was seen and H&R Block continued to be unhelpful to call back on Friday, February 13th and a funds trace would be placed. If the trace came back that the funds were received by the bank a fraud claim regarding the bank and undelivered funds could be requested. EMERALD CARD SERVICES Called back and spoke directly with a manager. He could not assist me but would transfer me to the department who could. On hold for 1 hour 17 minutes Hold music abruptly ended and I was disconnected. TAXCUT ONLINE Was told by representative that they can only verify my e-fie status had been accepted by the IRS and that they could see when checking their refund status site that it showed my funds deposited on February 6th. DROVE TO LOCAL TAX PREPERATION OFFICE TO SPEAK DIRECTLY WITH MANAGER. Asked to speak with manager, none was available Spoke with A. Steen and explained what was going on. She took me to her desk and within 5 minutes produced a photocopied piece of paper that explained to H&R Block employees that deposits anticipated to be made to the Emerald Card on February 6th would in fact be deposited on February 10th. Because it was there for me to see in black and white, and someone had actually listened, I left satisfied. I called and left a message for R. McNaley, expressing how happy I was that one person in the H&R Block company took five minutes to give me resolution. 8/10/2009 NO DEPOSIT MADE 8/11/2009 Attempted to call H&R Block bank directly, but was transferred to technical assistance. Went into local tax preparation office and spoke with A. Keener, Office Manager, Tax Advisor 3 I showed her this log and explained my problem and she immediately referred to something called a settlement sheet? According to the sheet, she said, my refund should be deposited to my Emerald Card by midnight on February 13th. She was very nice and as helpful as she could be, as there are no representatives available for the bank only tax advisors. She gave me her card and said she would like to hear from me, either way, on Saturday. OTHER NUMBERS I WAS GIVEN: CLIENT SERVICES, TECHNICAL SUPPORT. If its not on my card by midnight tonight (02/13/09) I will not only call the IRS and file a federal fraud claim agaist H&R Block Bank, but I will write to K. BARNEY, CEO of H&R Block Bank and R. SMYTH, CEO of H&R Block letting them know what kind of legal action they should expect against their company. I WILL NEVER USE H&R BLOCK AGAIN, NOR WILL I REFER ANYONE. THEY ARE CROOKS, THEIVES AND FORIEGN CALL CENTER LIARS. We are late on rent/electric/water sewer/phone/school payments for my 7 year old son/car payments and have had to cancel our wedding, as it is now only 2 months away and reservations have been lost due to non-payment on Feb. 7th). (Refund amounts were $3409 and $805)
I had received a coupon from them to get $50.00 off my taxes when they were preparied so I went back had them done got home realized that this amount didn show on my paper work so I called she said she would take care of it when i received my refund back the money still was not added back in so i called them she told me they only thing they could do is give me 50.00 off my taxes the following year. I do not agree with this cause I do not know that I will use them the following year so I think this is totally unfair to give out the coupons then not honor them.
I filed my taxes using H&R Block for the tax year 2007. It was found that there was an error on our part and we had to ammend the taxes. This was not a problem. About 4 months later we recieved a letter from the IRS Stating we owed approx. $780.00 and anyone living in these times on a paycheck to paycheck basis knows that this is a substantial ammount of money. I called H&R block and informed them of the letter and they asked me to come back in with all of my paperwork and figure out what had happened. I dealt with a man named NILES. Niles notified me that he had misplaced numbers on Line 19 of our amended return and this had offset things. The $780 was supposed to have been taken out of our refund and it wasnt because the form was not filled out properly. Remember... Niles admitted it was his fault. He then went on to tell me that there was nothing he could do and that we would have to pay the ammount owed. I went home that afternoon and called the 1 800 number for H&R block and they told me that they would launch an investigation and that I should wait on a phone call. So... I waited. November rolls around and I get another letter fromt he IRS informing me that the money I owe is gathering interest. I then called H&R block again and they told me that I wouuld have to pay it myself. So I called the 800 number again and was told the same thing as before... an investigation would be launched. In january I recieved my W-2 and decided to try to tackle this situation full on. I had to return to H&R block to retrieve my paperwork fromt he 2007 tax season. I called ahead and they told me that I could come get it. When I arrived they told me I could not have my paperwork unless I paid the IRS off completely. I will admit I became a little.... beligerant. But not to much. Needless to say, after the law had been informed, I left there with my paperwork without paying my taxes. I went to Jackson Hewitt to have my taxes done for the 2008 tax season and they helped me walk through the issues and get the money that I owed to the government taken out of this years refund. Reguardless, I am out that $780 plus the expenses I had to dish out while taking off of work to have the issues handled, The expense of the original return (to the sum of over $200) I dont believe in some one paying me for Frustration
Sunday Feb 1, 2009 my Fiance and I went to have our taxes done. When we get there, there was 1 other couple in front of us. About 45 minutes later, a woman walks in who knows some of the workers. I over hear her convo (as they weren't being quiet at all!). She said that she went to a different branch to have her taxes done but she just got up and walked out because they weren't doing hers right. She asked the worker how long it would be until she could get in. The worker told her it would be a bit because there were people ahead of her (us being one of those people!). About 1hr 30 minutes later. One of the workers comes out to get the next person in line (which was us!) and she looks to her friend who walked in after us and motioned for her to come with her to get her taxes done. I said "Ma'am, when will it be our turn?" She told me they were going as fast as they could and that they would get to us as fast as possible. I told her "That might be the case, but she walked in AFTER us" Then she told me that she can't help who has appointments and who doesn't. So there is when I get mad. I told her, this lady DIDN'T have an appointment because I heard her entire conversation. So one of the workers who was sitting around doing NOTHING turns on a computer and does our taxes. We told her we wanted the cheapest way possible and it didn't matter how long we had to wait. So after she was done, she told us it was $300. I questioned her about it and asked how that is the cheapest way possible. She used the excuse that it was because there was so many papers. WHATEVER! I get home and call the district manager. She told me the same thing. She also informed me that our money would be deposited into our account Today, Friday the 13th. So we wake up, call our bank. They told us that it wasn't deposited, they don't have any pending payments either. So we call H&R Block again and they tried using the excuse that the bank might be holding it for a few days. So I tell her what the bank told us. So right now we don't know where out money is or when we will be getting it. I would advise you NOT to go to H&R Block. They will do everything to ***** *** over.
I am writing this complaint as a warning to anyone who is considering h and r block , i had my taxes filed by a woman named natalia who obviously was a little clueless and filed my taxes incorrectly, i paid 300.00 to recieve my taxes in 8-15. when it had been 16 days and i had not gotten by taxes i contacted the irs and was told of the errors, when i contacted natalie to explain there is an error with my taxes she said to me that is a lie i do my job and refused to help me. also she refused to let me speak with a manager. i called back and asked to speak with roxy the manager who also offered me no help and explained to me that the reason i was called a liar by a professional tax rep was because of a language barer because natalie is not from out country. i still have not gotten my taxes fixed and i guess i wont be getting any help from h and r block since they have already taken my money. so please re think using h an r block. they really are not professional. be careful
I understand that taxes are a seasonal thing but it doesn't seem like anyone knows anything, at least at the location I use. I have been going to H&R Block for several years now and I had been hearing bad feedback from some family members this year but decided to go ahead & continue to use H&R. Last year my check was handed out to someone else so I had to wait to have a new check issued. This year I am really frustrated because I was expecting my refund to be deposited into my checking account by 2/10/09 as I was told. I have called everyday this week (today is Thursday) and have been told different things. I had been told that my refund was approved and today was told it wasn't. I've been told it's just a matter of it being transferred into the bank. It doesn't seem like anyone there knows anything. I pay good money every year to get my refund back as quick as possible. I will not be returning to H&R next year. And it really frustrates me that I pay over $200 to have them back by a certain time & it's not happening.
Brian told us he filed our taxes correctly and didn't. He didn't fill out the child tax credit form we needed even though we told him SEVERAL times that we had a newborn at home and we hoping to get a bigger return. We got a call from brian saying something was wrong with our taxes so we called him and noone answered. Didn't ever recieve a call back and had to go to two stores where they told us they couldn't do anything. Finally got ahold of brians manager and she told us he never makes mistakes and she wasn't liable for any mistakes anyway. She was calling me a liar and kept repeating that he doesn't make mistakes. Apparently, her employees do no wrong haha what a joke. Bottom line, I will never use this joke of a tax service again. Ever. Lost money in deposits on car. Late on bills. No grocery money.
Years ago, when I first graduated from college and had my first job, I went to H & R Block for my income taxes becuase they advertised a very low cost for a tax return where there were no itemized deductions. When I finished my interview, I was charged considerably more than the advertised price. When I questioned this, I was told that it had taken time to determine that no deductions would need to be itemized. I never went back to H & R Block because I decided that they had no integrity. I registerd this complaint today after reading what others had written intheir complaints. I just wanted to back up their allegations with mine.
In 2006 i did my taxes preparation with H&R Block and got the insurance Peace of mind that they offer,same that cover up to$5000.00dls in any additional taxes Assessed because they error. Well they make a mistake in my preparation that cost me to pay to the IRS $2,021.00dlls and H&R Block only send me a check for$1303.00dlls and i being dealing with this since july of 2008they still own me $718.00, i call them and nobody knows what to do or just put me on hold or not answer me. Please tell me what to do. this situation create me lot of stress and make feel frustrated
2-02-09 I went to H R BLOCK to have my taxes done for $250+ dollars. I paid additional fees for the rapid refund and more fees for the check vs. the emerald card. No check. same message as everyone else. Very upset I'm in the worst situation. I'm a single mother, going to school and just got my hours cut from 30 hours a week to 20. And it may not seem as much, but when your a waitress, it effects you big time. My car has wear and tear and was looking forward to maintenace since it is the only means of transportation with my son and I. I am losing focus on school with all the anxiety of catching up on my bills since last year it was such a breeze to collect. (thats probably since I didnt use H R BLOCK last year). I was sucked in by their commercial for coming in early for a cash advance of up to $1,000 dollars. But when i arrive i only got $350. but $50 was taking out by fees. AAAARRRGGHH
This year, 2009, my husband and I decided to go to H&R Block for our taxes. We just had a baby last year, and both of us are military, so we thought it would be easier to do it with a professional. We had 1 Federal and 4 States. Our appointment was on 8-Feb-2009 and was only supposed to last from 1215 until 1300, so we brought our 10 month old daughter along for the ride. When we arrived there, we had to wait about 10 minutes past our scheduled time. I had no problem with this, because I know sometimes appointments can run over. Once we started, it was evident that the tax lady had no idea what she was doing. We ended up staying until 5pm. That's a whole 4 and a half hours for taxes that shouldn't have taken that long. I had to keep telling her that she was inputting data wrong, and it was more like me doing my own taxes and her pushing buttons on the computer. After about 3 hours of ongoing numbers, she decided that she would leave and take a smoke break in the middle of our taxes. I was completely shocked over this, and when she came back I was very upset. I held my cool, and just wanted to get the visit over with. Once we got all the taxes straight, she then told me that it was going to cost $450 dollars for everything to be filed. What really made me angry was that I asked for a discount for taking so much time, and she said it wasn't possible. She also told me that she could only e-file the federal tax return and 1 state. I paid for this service because I had already wasted so much time, and just wanted everything over with. She sent me on my way with 3 envelopes and 3 state returns for me to mail off and get checks for. Plus I had one cranky daughter after almost 5 hours of misery! This is uncalled for, and horrible customer service. I lost approx $500 dollars towards something that should have been discounted at the least for the amount of time it took to process all of that.
We went to a local branch on saturday february 7th at 7 pm, normally tax prep has taken us an hour tops, nothing changed, actually had less w-2 forms than any year previous, should be easier...one would think. After HELPING their TAX PROFESSIONAL figure out several of the forms, and getting a total refund amount I left the branch dissatisfied because i had figured my taxes to be $1000 more just before arriving there, thats BEFORE their fees, went home spent 35 minutes using THEIR own software online, had completed everything, found their mistakes, then went back simply because of an emerald card advance that my wife and i had taken out. file the taxes after explaining the errors to 2 TAX PROFESSIONALS, and they finally got what i came up with to the dollar, did a RAL for 1-2 days, after 2 days no word on a check, no word on being denied, when calling the branch they couldnt tell me anything at all with the exception that it might be in tomorrow. tax prep and RAL cost me 257 dollars AFTER I HAD TO TEACH THEM THE RIGHT WAY TO DEAL WITH HSA ACCOUNTS. Missed out on a minimum of 2 days of required overtime at my job to pick up my check, possible consequences still to come for that and was told that if my RAL check wasnt in today, that they couldnt authorize a refund of the fees associated with an offer of a ral that i didnt get in the 1-2 days they guarenteed, I plan on going in towards close of the branch tonight will end up probably kicked out of the office knowing my luck and their intelligence levels, my wife and i WILL NEVER EVER RETURN THERE nor will any friends if i have any say so in the matter, was just rediculous service and fees, could have filed online for 20 dollars total and had my money just as fast as it seems, saving me 237 in fees, AND able to work my overtime
The Man has been doing my taxes for 30 years. This year I had some inheritance but he goes ahead and fills the form out like its all my money. He comes up with about $49,000 that I owe in taxes. This is a very bad mistake. Im still waiting for him to correct the proplem. The man was very rude. I have been very stressed out. I am disabled and this situation has not helped me at all. I wrote to both the IRS and the Frachise Tax Board and asked them to watch out for my returns. I'm just very frustrated.
I went in to the H & R Block office on Jan. 16, 2009 with inquiries about tax preparation, with a possible intent to have them filed. Before my questions were answered, the preparer filed the taxes not to my liking. May I add that she told me I would get much more than I actually did. Upset about the propsed dilemma and attempting to shield prospective clients from hearing my dissatisfaction, the supervisor rudely grabbed ALL of the documents off of the table and went into the back office. She implied at one point that I was attempting some illegal act, which is untrue. She said that she was going to cancel the instant check that printed out as well as the entire e-file. She told me to leave her office, giving me only my w-2 back. I asked her what it was that I was supposed to do next, and she simply told me to call 1800hrblock. She refused to give me a business card. I was very upset and in tears at this point. The other preparers apologized for the supervisors behavior and told me to come back at a later date when all was cancelled in order to re-file my taxes. I called the number and complained and was told to expect a call, which I never did. I went to see the district manager who promised to resolve the case, but never did. I contacted the 800 number again and was told that the two checks were already issued and CASHED! I was furious and went back to the office to be told that it was a lie. Caroline tried to ile that she never told me that she would cancel the tax prep. I asked her why she kept my copy of the return if that was the case and, of course, she was caught in her lie. Out of the blue a customer service manager for the company called me to apologize and said that what the phone rep said was a lie. The IRS has direct deposited the money as of Friday morning, Feb.6, 2009. I have received none of it. The IRS instructed me to file a police report, which I did yesterday with the Fort Worth Ploice Department. I need help. HR Block will not assist me uet the IRS has assured me that they have the money. I have suffered emotionally and financially from this situation. I have had anxiety attacks and been overwhelmed by stress due to the situation. My studies and job have been affected as well as my relationships with my husband, kids, and friends. Financial plans were crushed , as I was relying on this return as do many Americans. I would greatly appreciate any help in regards to what I should do now. Legal referrals would be great! Thank you.
I had my taxes done by H&R block and they electronically did my taxes on January 22, 2009. The computer said it was sent out on January 30,2009 and i should get it by Febuary 4, 2009. Not only didn't i get it I went to the IRS and they said that it has been pulled for a review probably because i filed for the first time homeowners credit 5405. What is the point of filing for it, if you don't receive it. All the IRS can say is you should get a letter (which still hasn't come) and not even giving me a time for it to be reviewed. The IRS wants there taxes on time, what about US we the people, I think the president should look into what is going on with the IRS and its delays to get help to people especially those like myself which just went through a natural disaster, which the president declared here where i live and help us a little, we aren't looking for handouts just want is due to us on time!
I had my taxes done at my local HR Block office. I paid the fees to have a rapid refund check, which I was told would be 1-2 days. At the end of the 2nd day, I had not heard from them. I called to see if my check was ready and I was told that it unfortunately was not due to a printing machine error. They then apologized and said it would be ready the next day. The next day came and went, I again had to call THEM to ask where my check was. They then told me that my return was 'lost in cyberspace'. I went into the office the next day to complain to the area manager, when the employees there voluntarily informed me that the manager was the one responsible for the delay. They had been instructed by the manager to lie to me, and to stall for time. It took six days to get my refund. All the while they had been lying to me, and providing me with call back times to which they never called. I always had to initiate the contact. In the end I spoke with the district manager. All he did was deny the situation and offer me my fees refunded and a coupon. HR Block says 'you have people'. Well if those are the kind of people, then who knows what would happen if you actually needed their audit guarantee. They would probably deny ever having helped you, close up shop, and leave town. Time, transportation costs, lost time at school, stress. They just didn't even treat me like a human being.
Second year using HR block. Both years shortchanged. This year, gave uncle sam a couple thousand ($2,700-$3,200 approx), and got back...$29? I make around 20-30k a year, usually on the lower side of that, and live check to check. The fact I was shortchanged TWICE really urks me. As a result, my last two years of returns were inaccurate, meaning I am OWED money; money that I may never see, as I cant understand exactly HOW they screwed up my return that bad in the first place. I am currently awaiting a resolution in this case.
It started like this. My husband and I needed to fie our LLC ( as partners) and I knew how to do it, but I had been really busy, so I decided to go over to the local H&R Block. Big Mistake. I went in, had to wait about an hour, because noone knew how to do my taxes, except "Mary". So I went shopping, and came back. Sitting down with her, I gave her all my info, and paperwork, efiled and that was that. Took maybe 20 minutes at most. Went outside to my husband whom was sitting in our car with our 9 month old son who had been upset all day feeling fine as can be, then.. that morning I call their 800 number to check my status. I got this weird message saying that they need my help, a number did not match a name on the file. So I called up Mary, asked what was going on... was my husbands bday. Fixed that. Called again later to check on the status,.. same message, this time the Social did not match with my husband,...which I had not figured out yet... I had thought maybe they had my son's name wrong or something. So I called the office, it was kinda late, but to my surprise Rosa, or something answered. Now take in mind, that I had never met this lady, had no clue as to who she was at all. I told her what message I was getting, and gave her my name and number to look up what was going on. She told me the same message the recording did, something did not match up. I asked her if maybe it could have been my sons name, she harshly responded.. m'am, It's NOT on your son's name it's on your HUSBANDS'. Okay, I was still calm, but getting upset. I said...Well everything is correct now, what could be going on? This was her reply....... I dont mean to affend you , m'am but I'm a hispanic too,..(My husband is hispanic, but she had never even seen him) and I know alot of Mexicans go down to Buford Hwy. and buy fake passports, ids and papers. Yeah,...I guess she was assuming that my husband was illegal and HE had the stupidity to try and file with someones' stolen social. I responded, uh M'am yes, that does offend me, and you have absolutley no right to say that to me. Now, theres us something wrong here, but it is not with my husband. She proceded to call me Honey, and I responded,..No I am not your HONEY, do not refer to me as that,... I am a PROFESSIONAL business woman. Afetr minutes of arguing, I demanded.. WELL if you people can not do my taxes correctly I want a refund of my fees. (Yes, I had prepaid $306 to this company, before e-filing. She said, Yes, okay, Ill put it in.It will be refunded, you can come in the morning and bring your file. Yes..okay. As you can imagine, I was alomst in tears, very upset that I could be treated like this as a customer. The next morning I headed over to mymothers' house, and called customer service, still shaken. The nice lady who answered took my report and told me that someone who be contactingme regarding what had happend. She also explained to me that I should be getting something in the mail (refund of fees). I felt so much better! She also told me if someone calls from the office i filed at, asking questions, to feel no obligation to answer such questions. So. I got a call about 3 days later from a office in a nearby town, I told her what happend, amd she apoligized, saying that... that was just the kind of person "Rosa" ws, thats how she talks to people, going on and on about that. I said, I dont know this lady, andshe had no right to talkto me at all, in that matter..and "Rosa" jad aslo mentioned that "they" meaning I dont know who, were looking at my file earlier when my husbands birthday was incorrect. Now, I am pretty sure, I said to her, that the only person who should be working on my case is Mary. She then asked me "Is there anything we can do for you" I replied I dont know.. I havent heard from anyone since, and today I called the customer service number, asking where is my refunnd of fees? They said, that I could only be refunded of fees that IRS had sent me in the mail because of thier mistakes. Then I reminded the lady on the phone, that the guaruntee states, if for any reason you are STILL unsatisfied, you can recieve a refund of all monies paid. She then told me I had to request that at the time of purchase, which makes no sense to me, becasue I had paid, even before my taxes were filed. So according to what she is saying, I ad to make my request before they processed my debit payment, before all of this happend, which WOULD NOT MAKE ANY SENSE WHATSOEVER! I am infuriated. I want my money back now. She gave me ANOTHER case number and told me someone shouold contact me in about 3-7 days. Im absolutely sure that I will have no hair left after this is finished. I will not be working with H&R Block ever again, nor will I ever reccomend it. Thank You.
I filed my taxes for 2008 using H&R Block TaxCut Online Services. My refund to be deposited into my account by H&R Block was suppose to be in the amount of 2,362.10. That amount is minus their 44.90 fee for using the the online site 14.95 and for their Simple Pay Fee 29.95. H&R Block only deposited 2,203.10 shorting me 159.00 with no reason or notice. I was not contacted in any way, shape or form. Upon noticing this, I then called H&R Block and was told the only thing he could tell me was that it was an authorized taking. He could not tell me why or what for. He gave me another number to call for H&R Block Bank. After calling them 3 times and being disconnected and put on hold for about 20 minutes I spoke to a gentleman who told me it was for a past fee owed for 159.00 I told him that fee had been paid over 1 year ago now. I gave him the check number, the date it cleared my bank, and the amount (159.00) he said he didn't need that info. and they never showed any payment, just the amount due. I responded that amount has been paid I have the proof right in front of me, who do I send it to? He said he didn't know. All he could do was open a case file for me and someone (he didn't know who) will get back to me within 15 business days. I responded by telling him that was unacceptable to me. I explained I lived on a very strict budget and because of their unauthorized taking, caused me hardship. I now have to alter my rent payment and have no grocery money. He offered nothing except to wait for a call in 15 business days. I got no apology, no nothing. They immediately took out 159.00 but want me to wait 15 days before anyone will even talk to me about this unauthorized taking. So I'm out 159.00 and no one will help me. I have proof that debt was paid over a year ago. This is a clear cut case of unauthorized taking. As I stated before, I got no notice, information, nothing that they were taking this money. They just took it without my knowledge and now, tell me they can't do anything for at least 15 days??? I need MY money now. I can't afford to wait! If they took it immediately, why can't they give it back immediately upon showing them proof of their mistake?
The people when I first got there seemed really nice. The place was very clean and it felt welcoming until I got to Anita. I understand that throught the years things have changed but she was down right rude. She felt that my lifestyle was open for her comments. I am a 19 year old mother, young but she didnt have any right to say what she did. Stating that my daughter was the biggest mistake I've made and more. I have to say I have never filed my taxes before and I have never had a complete stranger make me cry. But I left the store knowing I will never file my taxes there. She also cheated me out of money I should have gotten. from there I would have only had 540.40 but my mother is doing mine instead and I get 3000. The second reason I am complaining is the next day Anita calls and lets me know that the IRS doesnt reconize my daughter who is 5 months old, she could have simply left it at that. She decided she was going to put her opinion once again in my life as she was mother. Thats why I told her to cancel what she had done and I went somewhere else. I was out over 2000 dollars
I decided to use the internet. It was cheaper and H&R block has been pretty good to me. Yes you do sign a form that your credit will be check. Its a loan people. Banks aren't giving out those loans like they used to. Now I am waiting on my refund through the internet because at first the IRS was behind.
I was robbed of my own money. I will call the Attorney General on this. I will not stop complaining. I paid 500.00 dollar to get my taxes done. Yes, pick up your mouth off the floor. I made under $40,000 and I just bought a home and I donated under $4,000 to the church. H & R Block nickled and dimed me to death. I asked Bruce (the rip off tax consultant) for a list of how they charged, he just showed me on the computer. I told him I wanted a print off. I want proof of how I was ROBBED of MY money. I will be calling several people to see what H & R Block doing to us. BEWARE: Ask for a Billing Calculation.
On January 28, 2009 me and my husband used H&R block web-site to do our taxes wich they said was free that's a crock it cost us 30.00 to fill our state return well we sent it in and the next day i checked our e-mail to find a letter that said our federal return had been rejected and our state return had been placed on hold . i went to our local h&r block office and told them what the e-mail said and asked how i get my 30.00 back since they messed it up they told my that it wasn't there fault it was the irs and they couldn't give me any money or help me to fix the problem . i called the irs they said someone was using either my ss# or my husbands ss# then they said our agi # didn't match then they said that last year we filed a paper return and we didn't we used h&r block then too come to find out h&r block messed our taxes up last year too so now we had to fill out a paper form for the federal and the state and mail them in we have been running around for almost 2 weeks trying to fix h&r block's f^$@ up we are behind on our lights just got a final notice in the mail and we both have heath problems i wish i had never seen H&R block they should be put out of bussiness and i also know 2 other people they scamed 200 and 400 out of i will do what ever it takes for them to be put out of buissenss or at least have to right there wrong doings as if things aren't bad enough for every body all over the world trying to make ends meet seeing our kids and pets doing without or with very little the people that just about everyone looks to for help is messing with us taking our money saying they did nothing wrong when we all know better so to everyone out there using h&r block BEWARE and to those of us who are dealing with there crap try to hang in there
We went to have our taxes done at HR block, simple fedaral and state return, we spent 2 and 1/2 hours there towards the end when we wanted to look into any deductions for mileage and misc. things we were then informed that those forms were an additional cost and hadent been told that we were allready up to 334.00. When I called to set up the appt. I was told it typically costs between 100-200 dollars. We got less back than the year before and charged way more than EVER! Then informed that the stimulas package from last year is deducted off of your taxes this year, its was more or less just a loan. We are absolutely discuted with HR block and will never ever go back. Total RIP OFF, They should inform you as you are doing your taxes as to the cost and what you may have to pay so you can RUN for your life. Go to the little tax people, (mom and pop) who charge a flat rate and dont take 2 hours of your life and your money. Then the receptionist when we called for the number to the district office told us she was new and didnt know that info and wouldnt get it for us, and if we werent happy with her we could file a complaint against her. She was RUDE!!!!
I filed my taxes on theh 23rd of January, and opted to do the 8-15 days. The IRS reported that my taxes were deposited on February 6. However, my bank doesn't show it. I called HR Block, they gave me some excuse that they received an email stating they were not able to cut the checks because the IRS was overloaded with returns. She told me to check my bank account after 5. So I did and then called them back. I told her I paid to have the money there in 8-15 days and the 7th would be 15 days. She said that HR Block is not responsible for delays from the IRS. She told me to call back Monday, I might be able to get my fees reduced...
After already filling out all tax documents on H&R Block online, I then decided to allow someone other than myself review my paperwork before submitting to the IRS. I made the first appointment and waited while I watched two other customers go before me( who had only been there for a few minutes), I had been waiting for almost an hour. The second appointment, The associate, had no idea about tax refunds available to me. Such as "First time home owner"- which gave me back 4200.00 in addition to all my other write off's. Not only did he lack the knowlegde for the position in which he held, he then charged me 268.00 for his services- although I had already filled everything out myself. The work was done. But because I could not waste any more timedealing with these ignorant associats, I had to file with H&R Block and deal with getting basically robbed.
I file my taxes efile on 1/23/2009. I was informed by IRS that refund will be deposited by 2/06/2009. I confirmed that it was sent to H and Rblock and called to reconfirmed. I was told about H and R block rep that refund was depited to my account. I called my bank and was told that it was not. I called the offie where I prepared my taxes and was asked to come in. Ms. M that funds were not released by Irs and that in fact they were under audit and it will take three weeks. I informed Ms. M that I spoke with Irs and H and Block rep. Ms. M in a rude manner refused to contact H and R block or look at website to reconfirm. However continue to tell me it was being audited. She showed a paper that stated general information about direct deposit and having refund mailed to to you. In addition in looking at H and R Block website it states that deposited my refund. However when I called they now state that my fund will not be released until 2/10/2009 which was the anticipated date of when the IRS was suppose to finish processing my taxes. So basically I was leid to all day, forked over four hundred dollars for lousy service and unfortunately because my refund was process early they feel they can hold the money. Not to mention that most of the day I was told that my bank had my money. Check the status of your return 24 hours a day Your IRS refund amount has been released to be direct deposited into your bank account. Please confirm with your bank the exact amount deposited and availability of those funds as the funds may be delayed 1-2 business days or more due to your bank.
The loan that the IRS issued was not sent to me and I was told it wouild be in by 7:00 pm and it was not. i need to find out what needs to be done to get my refund.
On January 31, 2009 my husband and I went to H&R Block located in Garland, Texas (Shiloh Springs) to file our taxes as we do every year; just to recieve the instant refund that they offer. On February first I looked up our return and it stated that there was wrong information on our return. I called the office and they stated there was a wrong social security number or last name. I spent a couple hours looking at my return trying to figure out the mistake of our tax preparer. Finally, I found that he had inputed the last number of my daughters social security numbebr wrong. They said they would resubmit it to the IRS correctly (keep in my they already told us it would be 1-2 days bebfore we recieved our funds on the card). Two days went by and still no money. Come to find out the time line changed from 1-2 days to 8-15 days now. I paid over $300 dollars for a return that I could have done online and recieved quicker. I have had this company file m taxes for the last 4 years, but this will be the last time I am deceived by those scam artists.
I went to H & R block were I have gone for the last 4 years. I was charged 208.00 for them to do my taxes. I had nothing special done. I was charged 130.00 extra because they filed my earned income credit for my children. this is normal paper work that is done at any other tax office. And were I should have been charged there start rate of 70.00 which is what every other tax office does for the eic form I was charged an extra 130.00. It will be the last time I use H & R block, And I have also informed all my friends and family so they are not overcharged too.
On 2/4/08 My husband and I went into the H & R block to file our taxes together for the first time. Both my husband and I had two set of W2's and one 1099. The lady that helped was nice but she couldnt help us get any deductions. We only end up getting back 293.00 from federal and 101.00 state. Then on top of that they charged us 278.00 for preparing our taxes. I nearly had a heart attack when i signed the check. I AM SO UPSET WITH H & R BLOCK. I WILL NEVER GO THERE EVER AGAIN. They just like to rip people off. I felt taken advantage of.
As I entered to have my taxes filed Mr. M didn't even welcome me until I answered a series of questions. Did I own a home, was I in school, did I have children and about 10 more question that I don't remember off hand. He explained that he wanted to know what documentation I needed before I sat down. In order not to waste the preparer time. When he was satisfied he called a preparer to assist me. As I was being helped I tried to give the person deductions I thought might help in preparing my taxes. She said I couldn't claim things such as uniforms because I didn't own my own business. She proceeded to ask Mr M who said absolutely not etc. I then asked,"why couldn't I claim these deduction?". I asked for an explanation, this is when Mr. M became irate. I began yelling at me declaring that I couldn't. His explanation was in terms that were unfamiliar to me. Accounting Jargon is something I don't understand. For approximately 20 or more years I have been doing my taxes with H&R Block. I have been filing at this particular location for about 3 years no. I am very confident in saying I will give my business to someone else. I believe Mr. M is a person who is used to treating people or women as though they are not to question his knowledge or authority and if this is what H&R Block has working for them I rather take my chances with another company, rather than be embarrassed and humiliated as I was in that office. My simple question was why can't I claim the items I was questioning instead I received a tremendous scolding. I had never had problems in the past. H&R Block should scrutinize who they hire in managerial positions better. Knowledge of the business is not the only area of concern. I believe the ability to explain taxes in a language people can understand is essential. Also not forgetting that although we are not purchasing any goods we are paying for services and so customer service is of the utmost. Mr. M should no customer service skills what so ever. I am truly disappointed in the way I was treated and will surely let my experience be known to all who will listen. I have also been trying to get in touch with the District Manager of this area to no avail. The District Managers name I was told was Enid C. This is why I have taken this course of action. Thank you for your time.
Today, February 4, I went in to get my taxes done and it was a bit different from past years as I've gone to the same place for the past 5 to 7 years. I told the woman accountant that I was poor and that I thought I might do it myself for less on-line but she consulted with her associate and they assured me it wouldn't be more than $130- 140. More than I'd like but worth the hassle of not doing it myself. The end total was $248. Wow. I objected and the woman objected to my objections but I wouldn't be put off so she spoke to her manager, came back and said there's nothing we can do. That's a standard sales technique, go to your boss and pretend it's out of your hands. I asked to speak to the boss, got the reply, OK if she's not too busy and she came right out and gave me the same routine, It's not us, it's the company, etc I objected and told her no, I asked for an estimate and was told 130 -140. She said there's nothing she could do. I refused to pay and walked out. I told them I'd had sales training and a lot of the techniques they used on me were standard lousy-style techniques. Theses 3 women gave me a low-ball figure, they consulted with each other, they rapid-talked me, they went to the boss, they denied my version of events and confirmed their story with each other using leading questions. The accountant even told me I was getting a little more than last year which wasn't true. They pretend to be your friend, they get you nodding and saying yes, they push for extra services, they don't tell you about the hidden charges, they give you a lowball estimate as if it was brain-surgery instead of standard forms then hit you with the figure and hope you don't have the time or courage to say no. They've always used sales technique but this year, they were much worse, no doubt due to online competition. It wasted my time. I said I'm not paying this and walked out. I never wait until April so I have the luxury of some time to figure out how to do it on my own which is in my best interests anyway.
First of all, I wished that I had looked up the consumer complaints for H and R Block before going to them. I had used Turbo Tax for 7 years with no problems, usually my refund was done within 7-8 days, at a cost of $80-$100 for the efile and all my taxes. This year due to my losing my job I opted to go to the BLOCK to file my taxes and do the RAL (1-2 days), yes, I knew that there would be fees for this service, but that is a choice I made. It has been 10 days, no refund yet, denied a RAL...not sure why, the Block has no record of my efile return...recorded message said to try again later. IRS says both my state and federal have been processed, and even though I am going to be refunded the $87 fee for the RAL, it still is going to cost me $255.00 for them doing my taxes. By the way, it was a 1040 and a child tax credit. I was not made aware of the costs of them doing my taxes until after we went through my return, which by the way I had to assist the person doing it. Will I go back...NO WAY. Chalk this up to a lesson.
I have used H&R Block for the past 3 years. I have always gotten a decent tax refund in a timely manner. Last year, we had 6 W-2s from 2 different states. This make for a fairly difficult return. We went to an H&R in the Pittsburgh area. It took this gentleman 6 hours to finish our return! We paid 130 dollars and decided that this year we would go to a different location. Well, we saw on television that you could now go to their website and chose your tax preparer based on their qualifications. And so, we did this and were sent to a different office than last year (right up the road). When we got there, he noticed that he had been to a different office last year and then we gave him our 4 simple W-2s ALL from PA! Not difficult! Not only did it take him FOREVER but when we were finished he told us that we owed $323!! This was after our $38 in coupons had already been taken out! When we seemed shocked he explained to us that this was a specialty H&R Block location and that they are the most expensive in the city because they handle a lot of big business in the area. Now, shouldn't he have told us his BEFORE completing our return! There are 5 H&R Blocks within 6 miles of my home! If the website had told me this office would be more expensive or if our tax preparer had told us this ahead of time... I would have gone somewhere else! We were completely taken advantage of and now had no choice but to pay, in order to have our return direct deposited into our account within the 6-18 days. We just had a baby and really needed this return. After having our check electronically take $323 out of checking account right then and there, we left the office very upset. I immediately called the 1-800 number listed in our paperwork. I waited on hold for over 40 minutes before speaking to a customer service rep. We were in the middle of filing my complaint and I was diconnected. I tried calling 5 more times over the next few days and each time I was diconnected each time I was placed on hold in order for them to check if my original complaint had been filed or deleted after I was disconnected. Each time I wondered, why don't they just call me back? I finally called the office we had our taxes prepared in. I was told that I would have to speak to the manager and she was not in. So I asked for the district office's phone number and was told that only the office manager could give that out. They next morning the same girl I had spoken to called me back and said that she needed to apologize for her office manager but she had an appointment first thing that morning and could not call herself. She wanted to pass along the message that I would have to call the 1-800 number. Well, that obviously does not work. When I complained and told this young woman of the many times my call was dropped she told me that she would have the office manager call me back after her 11:00 appointment. Five hours later, no phone call. I became frustrated because while in this attempt to get some of my money back, I was only running my cel phone bill up the wall being on hold constantly between this particular office and the 1-800 number that would take 30-40 min to speak to someone only to be disconnected! But, I decided to try one more time. I called the 1-800 number and AS SOON as a customer service rep came to the phone I told her that I keep getting disconnected. She said that they had been having problems with the system. I asked her if she could call me back if it happened again and I was told that their phones do not dial out. RIDICULOUS! Luckily, my call was not dropped this time. My complaint was filed and I was given a confirmation number. I was told someone would contact me in 6 days. As of now, I am still waiting for my return to be deposited into my account. I knew this would take some time, but what I wasn't counting on was having to give the H&R office what I had left in my checking account just to file a few silly W-2's. We have a brand new baby and I am having to put his formula and diapers on an emergency credit cards because I have no money until I get our return.
We had read all the comments that were written on the complains page for hr block, so when I went in to do my taxes before we even started, we specifically asked the women if this could affect my getting my taxes... she rattled off that it was because of the stimulus from last year was the reason and that I should have no issues getting back my taxes in 1-2 days. I told her that I could well do my taxes if there was going to be an issue and it was going to take longer. no she reassured me, well here I sit denied and it is going to take 13-18 days. They will tell you whatever they can to get you to let them do your taxes but if you can put the information on the form yourself go to the post office and mail it then do it, don't cost yourself the extra 300.00 for nothing. This money could have answered a few of my financial concerns that have been piling over the past month, due to an unexpected illness in the family, I am extremely stressed out. we had even planned on going on a small trip in a few weeks just to get away for a few days, but now knowing that I may not have the means to do that just adds anger to my frustration. I could have done my own taxes if I had been told the truth when I asked and that would have saved me money, I just hope that something good ultimately comes from this disaster.
I filed my taxes of 07-08 at the same H&R Block. In 07, my refund was only $120, my H&R Block fee was $65 leaving me with $55. If that wasn't bad enough, they trick me into paying $60 for the Peace of Mind Plan(meaning if you owe any money they back you up with $5000 to take care of it). Okay, so once again I'm back for 08 and learn I owe money, therefore my stimulance check from 07 is on hold. No one could tell me why I owe money and the Peace of Mind plan expired in 2007, so what I owe must be taken from my refund. I asked her when did me owing money show up, and I was told sometime in 2007. Since I had to pay for that, I asked for my $60 refund back toward the POM plan. I can't get a refund b/c I should of asked for it within 7 days of purchase. Seven days is not enough time for me to see if I owe anything, so why would I ask for a refund that soon, what a GREAT scam! This year my refund is $553 minus my H&R Block fee: $111.00 Bank fee: $30.00 (Suntrust) I owe: $155.00 leaving me with $257, and if I'm lucky maybe 2 stimulance checks, b/c they owe me money! All that said, I will NEVER step another foot in their office for as long as I live. My money is on my card and I need 2 new front tires on my car. I get to the tire shop and each tire is $100. The man puts both tires on & it's time to pay, my card DECLINED & he had to put my old tires back on, so humiliating!
After the Greenwood Office personally explained to me that they are the Best Office in the Indianapolis area I felt comfortable in offering them my Simple Tax forms to them. The person I chose explained to me that he's been doing Taxes for 14 years now, So with that said, I felt comfortable, But had explained to him that I was not very intelligent in the tax field and would need him to be honest with me, When finding items that would be a deduction. He was utterly rude right from the get go, He was having computer issues, He kept rebooting his computer, There were forms he reprinted many times and he expected me to remember everything With no understanding I am a first home buyer, and talking with my realtor, I had learned about the tax breaks I was to get, But H&R Block did not complete my Taxes correctly, Prior to purchasing my new home, I was to complete a contract that I had signed with my previous landlord, So the rent that was paid was not accurate in the tax forms, H&R Block did not include my property taxes that I paid on my new house in 2008 neither! Furthermore, H&R Block did not include my HUD Paperwork for the 2008 year, There are many, many items they did not include that I could of had deductions on! I was charged $212.00 for their services and when I didn't understand their fees, He remained rude,mean and was very impatient with me. I only received a $760+ tax return this year, and that's embarrassing, and it's wrong! I will never for the rest of my life choose any H&R BLOCK branch to ever do my taxes again. I have been honest and truthful every year, But with how I was treated and how they shorted my return, There are bills now that I can't pay in my home during this of need! This is abstruse, And I've lost all faith & respect for H&R BLOCK! Loss of deductions, time, and money owed to me!
On 01/14/2009 I went into HR Block to file my taxes and I had opted for the regular irs refund. I was not aware fo any loan that I was appling for because they told me it would be 8-15 days before I would get my refund directly deposited into my account. Soon after I checked the IRS and they said that my money was deposited into an account on the 30th of January. I called HR Block bank on 02/02/2009 and they said yes that they did receive my refund and that it would be deposited into my account on 02/03/2009. On that day I checked my bank account and nothing had been deposited. I then called the bank again and they told me that they did not have anything and that I needed to call the office where I filed. I then called them and they said that I was denied for a loan, that I was unaware I was applying for since I opted for the 8-15 day refund. Anyways I then was given a number to HSBC and I called and finally after hours of being on hold spoke to someone at 9pm. I gave the lady my social security number and name. She then told me that there was fraud on my social security number and I needed to take my complaint up with the fraud department. Bottom line is I am being told that I was denied for a loan that I never even applied for and they are holding my refund. No one is giving me any information and I am being charged HR Block fees of over $200.00 for money that I never did receive. I have had to miss work to deal with this, and several of my bills are late as a result of waiting on funds that have never been sent.
I went to the IRS web site and filed my return which should have been free but in the end I was charged for the free filing of both the state and federal. The federal cost $14.95 and then the state was $29.95 since I did not realize I had to pay I let them take it out of my return which was then an extra $29.95. Our ajusted gross income was less than $44,000 so we were entitled to get the service free. Since the filing on 1/18/2009 I have been trying to get a refund of my fees but they keep giving me all kinds of reasons that I would not be entitled. They do not know how to read their charges they claim they gave me a refund on the date of filing but that was the fee they charged me and there was no refund for fees given they even accused me of overdrafting my account and using the credit without knowing it. Currently while filing this complaint I have been on the phone now for 28 minutes with no results. It appears I am not alone I think they are preying on those who really need their refund asap. Please help I have had to borrow money because they had told me they refund the money when they put in my deposit. The deposit was $298 I should have recieved $373
loss of return amount. messed up taxes owed in another state. I have to pay another cpa a real cpa one that is not trained to enter in a number in a computer to ammend my taxes due to me lossing approx 1,000.00 in refund and i was harrassed in public infront of everyone in the office asking my nature of my disability, how i could pay 5,000.00 in medical expenses out of my pocket, saying i was a liar about my house interest amount paid, not having us sign a ky return which i told them the paper had to be signed and they said where? they taxed my disability income and didn't let my husband claim me as a dependant. so much more had been done and i don't have time to retype all of it i need a phone call back
My husband in I went into H&R block to have our taxes prepared. As soon as we sat down with the representative we (I) informed her that the reason we were having our taxes done by them, was so that we could get our money back as soon as possible. The representative assured me that as long as I did'nt owe any back taxes, owed child support, or student loans we should be fine. I was told to call back in the morning to make sure that my check had been printed before I come into the office to pick it up. I called and was told by a recording that I was denied. No apparent reason. I called the 1-800 number that was given to me over the automated call and recieved another recording from HSBC bank saying that I didn't fit the credit criteria. No one informed me that a credit check would be taking place. It hadn't in the past. I feel like this is misleading and illegal. Being that I was told I would be recieving my money on the next day, I electronically sent off my house note. If the representative would have been honest with me I would have waited and not have been 500 dollars in the negative with my checking account.
I went to H&R Block on January 24th, 2009 to have my taxes prepared. I am a single mother. My tax preparation was a fairly simple one in that it was only basic Head of Household, EIC, and credit for child care with (2) W-2s. I would have done the prep myself had I not anticipated the need for a faster return. I was astounded to learn that H&R Blocks' fee for JUST the prep was $255. Although I was a bit discouraged with that amount it could not be refuted at that time because the return had already been prepared. What I was NOT ready for was the fee had I chosen to get my return in 1-3 days (which is what I had initially wanted .. hence the reason I went to H&R Block in the first place). Had I chosen that option my return would have been REDUCED by nearly $1300! $255 for H&R Block and $1045 to God only knows where else. I was floored to see that option on the screen. Needless to say, as much as I could have used the money immediately, I choose the 8-15 day option paying only $255 and I'm still waiting for my refund. I will not use H&R Block again for any tax needs.
last year i filed taxes w/ h&R block. they said i would need to pay out 366$ and some change, now! before i could get my refund? so i said i guess im backed into a corner on that. so about a week later i decided to call h&r back and ask for a recipt on the 366 i paid out. they couldnt come up with one, on accoount of they have not even the slightest idea as to who the money went to. (little odd it was a huge deal to pay this unknown debt when it was about me. now not even getting the proper attention as a customer)so all in all,its been a year later still been calling maneger(s) one after another and come to find out, hsbc took my money and i have never even delt with them nor have an account. so how could i owe them and why do they get paid out of my taxes before i can even see the paper work? never been paid from them. they gave me and still are, the run around and around! now im having another deal because i got an emerald card from h&R and used it to pay some bills ,and i accidently overpaid a bill so i kindly asked them to put my money back on my card. now its been 3 weeks and nobody knows what the status on my returned money is. most of them have no clue about it untill i explain all over again. and yes hsbc financial bank is the base of the problem again! i couldnt pay my bills ontime. got charges now because a couple hundred dollars is gone by accident? i also am out about 560.00$ all due to h&r block and there lender HSBC financial bank. i could go on for hours with all the damage they have caused just because of those 2 issues!
I purchased the H&R Block's TaxCut program for 2005, 2006 and 2007. Each year everything seemed fine. Then in late 2007, I was audited. As soon as I received the audit notice, I did what the box told me to do. I called the 1-800 number. Much to my surprise, and in complete contrast from what they claim, they offer NO AUDIT SUPPORT! Outraged, I called every H&R Block office in my area trying to find one that was open that time of year. I managed to find one and went into their office with all of my things and asked for help. The lady behind the counter literally asked me to see the box I purchased. I couldn't believe it. I didn't have it with me, but we pulled up an advertisement on her computer and I showed her the guarantee. Then she started to look at my paperwork and said Well, we can't help you with this, you are being audited. I asked about what happens if I receive fees and she wasn't sure. She had to look on the computer screen for the 1-800 number off the advertisement we pulled up. I told her my plight with the 1-800 number and that is when she told me they are not associated with TaxCut and are not responsible for what they offer or guarantee. I now have a bill for over $5000 from those three years that I can't even begin to explain, much less comprehend. I caution anyone out there thinking of saving a few dollars in getting your returns filed less expensively and by someone who doesn't see past the fee you are paying them. AVOID H&R BLOCK like the PLAGUE.....it's what they do to you when they screw up! I am stuck with this $5487.00 tax bill that I can't afford, yet must pay to the IRS. Interest is constantly added on, the bill never seems to go down and since the initial bill, I've gotten add on letters from the IRS for head of house hold credits they are adding on that I never even qualified for in those years, nor applied for to my knowledge.
Went to do my taxes. Have 4 children, and always used H&R block in the past. Usually, the total bill comes to ~$120. Previous years info was not found. Spent over 1hr with the preparer. Bill this year came to over $400! There were some changes, bought a house, borrowed from 401k etc. When I looked at the fee breakdown, they charged a fee for every child, charged a $40 fee for a $30 credit and really nickle and dimed me. I did not want any type of loan or advance, this was strictly a preperation fee.
I went to H&R block for my first time on Friday Jan 23, the lady that helped me was Maria, when I arrived I was not told of any prices, thinking that I would pay a max of 150.00 to file because I have no assets i dont own anything all that I have is my job my 2 kids and Husband. When we were finnished the total was 266.00 which was alot to me but I had never been and said ok also i was informed that is i pad an add. 100.00 bringing my total to 341.00 I would get my cjeck in 1 or 2 days and i would get a call. When Tuesday Jan 27 came and I had not recieved my check I called and they said that it was there. Now that was days later not 1 or 2. my husband picked up the check and it was 800.00 short. I was very upset and called H&R block and talked with Larry Bear the manager and he told me very rudly that when the STIMULAS checks were handed out las year i didnt get all of mine and that it was added into my return. My total return before any fees was 3200.00 with there fees I was suposed to get back 2800.00 the check that i recieved was 2000.00 a whole 1200.00 short because of them. In telling Mr. bear that when i had went on Friday Maria had not told me anything about a stimulas added in. Larry began to get rude talling me that he would fire her right away and all his employees right away then he laughed at me. I told him that all i wanted Was my 341.00 bakc because i was miss informed about my whole refund and that he did not know when i would ever see that 800.00 and also for paying 100.00 to have my check in 1 or 2 days not 4 days later I am now out of 1200.00 that i desperately need in the way that our country is now and with me and my husband trying to keep our jobs and take care of 2 kids under 4 years of age that 1200.00 could go along way. I am very sad at how i was treated. I went to H&r block thinking that they new what they were doing and they had no clue. Even the manager did not know when i will see that 800.00 dollas that is owed to me. please help. thanks
I went into H&R Bock to have my taxes done. HUGE mistake. $385 it cost me, s single mother of 2. Even my tax preparer was surprised at the amount it cost. I was frustrated watching her and had to fix her mistakes as we went along. I even joked I should get a discount for as many times as I had to help her out! When I was able to move after the shock of finding out how much I had to pay (convienent how they can't tell you how much it is until the end) I asked how I needed to pay - she informed me that they just take it out of the refund. I only found out that this cost me $29 extrawhen I spoke with the manager the next day. I had the money to pay with a check. Another girl that had worked the night before said well it was on the screen. I found it interesting that the manager grabbed her arm tightly to keep her quiet. I had gone in there that day to find out if my money had been deposited as I had called the number on the card all day and had been hung up on EVERY time. She gave me another number to call and that would tell me if things had been deposited. When I called it said that the money had been placed on my card and that it was ready to use. As a surprise I took my kids out to dinner, something that we had not been able to do for a long time. It turned out to be a humiliating night as they came back and told me my card had been denied. I was so embarassed. I can't go back there. It is a small place. I am a case manager and a couple of clients were sitting at the next table. Talk about a hit to my credability. Luckily I was able to scrape the cash together. I had only gone in to H&R Block as I was really in need of the money as my W2 from a former employer came late in the month. My preparer even said thaqt it would have been cheaper and easier to take out a home equity loan given that I had to sign more things than I did when I bought my house. When I finally did get in touch with the number on the card they said that yes, it does say that the money was deposited but that there was a hold up on behalf of H&R Block and that it will not be avaiable until 3:00 eastern time. It had better!! My only satisfaction is that I am a case manager working with people and help them find places to get things done-like taxes and have already been able to share my experiences with 5 families who were planning on going to H&R Block - in addition to the computer guy that helped me with my wireless issues. Well, the $385 was a lot of money on a single income. I can't go back to the restaurant - too embarrassed, especially in front of my kids. Loss of credibility with clients. Lots of time lost in trying to get someone to speak with me. The $29.00 charge I paid extra to have them take out of my refund when i could have paid with a check
went to H&R Block forked over a small fortune. was told i would receive my refund in 1 to 2 days still not there. Come to find out i was denied. HSBC approved me for their credit card but denied my refund loan something isnt rite...... NOW I WENT OUT SPENT EXTRA MONEY THAT I REALLY DO NOT HAVE NOW RENT IS DUE IN THE NEXT COUPLE DAYS... THANKS H&R BLOCK ATLEAST U GOT YOUR MONEY RITE!!!!
I received my w2 forms on January 16th 2009 made an appointment with H & R Block ( which have done my returns for 7 yrs)for that day, op tied for which I have gotten many times and this time was denied, Was told that I would recieve my check between the 23 and the 27 of this month, I called the 28th and was told that my check would be at the office on the 30th,,,It is now the 30th and once again called the office and once again no check,,,I then talked with a superviser and was told that they would look futher into this matter,, Got a call from Mr. R and which informed me that my check was not there and the the Government was holding my check and 50 other peoples monies due to a stimulas increase,,,this is a bunch of -----,the government has all year to use all of our money for what they need to,,,as many of you out there I am a single mother with limited income and as the country is in this state of recession all of us need our refunds NOW !!!!!!!! We all need a place to sleep,and if we dont have our money,,, WHERE are we to go???????????????????
My Husband and I went and filed our taxes Early so they would be electronicly filed right on the 16th and filed for the rapid refund, my Husband was laid off this winter and we are 2 months behind on our rent and needed that money Urgently! We didnt qualify for the rapid refund and were not told why but a week and a half later the IRS said they had already deposited our refund to H&R Block and H&R Block automated number said our card was ready to use but, when I went to use it there was NO BALANCE on our card!!!!!!! I called the office and the receptionist said there NO ONE there that could help me and she was very rude and couldnt care less that I couldnt pay my rent. I guess $327.00 in fees to do my taxes isnt enough to care about their clients! I will never use H&R Block EVER again! Still have no answers and still have no way to pay my rent after I told my landlord I could pay it today because that's what the phone rcording told me when I called the automated number!!!!!
I filed with H and R Block Tax Cut and figured it was the safest way to go. I have never had a issue with this company in the past but this year it is a nightmare. My money was to be deposited into the bank on the 28th. That never happened. So on the 29th I called the Tax Cut line and they assured me that I would have it the next day the 30th. Well here I am on the 30th still nothing. I have talked to 10 different people who I swear have no idea what they are talking about. The last person I talked to told me that the IRS did some false info and they will not be depositing until today. Well being I used Simple Pay my money goes to H and R Block first so they can take out the fees. He also told me that I will have my money Thursday or Friday of next week. Ok so now we are at the 5th and 6th of Feb. I asked why it took so long..... his response was because of the processing time. WHAT!!!!! what happened to the 8-15 days that they promise. I filed on the 16th. That is like 20 -21 days later. I know I will not use them again next year. This is ridiculous I am a single mother of 2.
I went in for the advance before Christmas, and was denied. So at taht time they set up my appointment for me to get my taxes daone on January 16th. I paid for my taxes and RAL. Well finally on the 20th I called them because I had not gotten my money yet. And they said I had been denied for RAL, but it would be RAC instead and that I should have my money with in 8 to 14 days. According to the IRS, my money was direct deposited on the 23 and here it is the 28th and still no money. Now H&R Block says the IRS made a mistake and it won't be til the 30th. I will never go to H&R Block again. Plus the fact all the fees and bank charged I had to pay, and for nothing. Of course there is damage, and they know it.
I files my taxes online with H&R block. I opted to use the simple pay where The IRS deposits your refund In H&R Block Bank, they pull thier fees and then deposit the money in your account. The agreement I signed said they will deposit your money 1-3 days after the IRS deposits it with them. The IRS deposited my refund on 01/23/09. It is 1/28 and I still have not recieved my refund. I called them and they kept giving me excuses and saying it would be 1-3 days..it has already been 1-3 days! I just wanted to know when it WOULD be deposited into my account and no one could tell me. After researching not-so-simple pay online I see dozens upon dozens of complaints everywhere about it. I will never use them again and it should be illegal for them to be doing this to everyone. You don't play with people's money! This is very stressful because now I'm wondering if they will ever give me my money! They have over $6000 of mine and won't tell me where it is or when I will get it!
i was in the offices doing my taxes and i asked the lady if you have a child missing for 17 years why the irs don't ever gived me credit. i also said to her the irs hold my taxes for 17 years with the excuses the it was for the student loan. my student loan was 3,000.00 thousand dollard. the irs got me with 20,000,00 dollars. never gived me any credit for a child missing 08/08/85. how can i talk to some one? she said welli don't know? i let her do my taxes and it was on friday. on sunday i call my taxes it wasen't in the offices, no one said anything, when i walk in. the front desk said. oh! the irs is holding you're check we don't have any idea. the irs didn't proved it. i arrived home in watauga wood and i talk to a friend the is working in 1 of offices inside the hsr block. my friend look in the computer and siad. this people inside hsr block lie to you. you was aproval. some one inside the offices send and e-mail to the irs with you're information and this is the id# and this is the copie also of the transation the irs proved the check to the hsr block. call a lawyer. so i will do. none clerck or employee inside the hsr block can't break people confiality. bad moved. emotional also lie to custumer. fee need to go back to my returnd. i send information to the fbi.
We took out a H&R Block loan in November, with Ms. Veda Pennymon, and she estimated that we would get back 8000.00 this year before the loan, and after the loan we would get back at least 6000.00. When we filed last night we were told we were only getting back 4050.00(somewhere around there) before the loan. After the loan we will receive 2700.00. How is that? I understand that it was just an estimation, but to be off 3000.00 is not an esimation it a mess up.
On January 26, 2009 my wife and I went to the H&R Block on 1025 Nashville Pike Gallatin, TN. 37066 to file our income tax. Our tax specialist M. Patterson prepared our taxes and notified us the fees and options on how we would collect our check. We showed Miss Patterson all of our documents including the 1040A which is a monthly statement from the IRS. Miss Patterson never mentioned to my wife and I that the IRS would withhold the amount of $1,805.60 and it would take eight to fifteen days to receive the remaining amount of our income tax. Miss Patterson proceeded to give us the options on the time length and the fees in which we opted for the one to two business day refund check. If it was explained to me that it might take longer because of the money owed to the IRS and the IRS would automatically take the $ 1,805.60 I would have considered other options. Re-adjust my financial obligations to my creditors.
I filled out a class action law suit back around September for all the money back from H&R Block over the years and still haven't heard anything yet or gotten a check in the mail. Could you please advise me who to contact regarding the status of my refund. I always filed as head of household or single so it was just me who would receive money. Money is very important to me and I waited for it. I had just started Concord Law School when I filled out the form and sent it in. I'm 50 years old.
In 2007, I went to h&r block to have my taxes done. I took my last pay stub and did a rapid refund. I received my refund on the emerald card which is a rip off because it takes your money from you whenever you use it. Things were going okay until December 2007 when I received a letter from the IRS saying that I owed them $1600. I went back to H&R Block in January 2008 and apparently the person who did my taxes put the incorrect amount of earned income on the return. The tax preparer was no longer employed by H&R Block so someone else did an amended return that I had to submit to the IRS. This time they told me that I would get an additional refund in the amount of $118. A few months later, which was September 2008, I received another letter from the IRS saying that the amended tax return was incorrect and I owed $1600. I went back to H&R Block with the letter from the IRS and someone did another amended tax return and I had to send that to the IRS and pay the penalties that I owed the IRS which was $153. I received another letter from the IRS saying I now had to pay the balance of $1500. I went back to H&R Block with that letter and found out that H&R Block was saying that it was nothing that they could do because someone declined the peace of mind on my behalf. I never knew anything about the peace of mind! It was no way to dispute it because the original tax preparer did not work there anymore. H&R Block employs the most incompetent people and you will have to pay for their mistakes. I gave that guy my W-2s a few days after he did my taxes. Therefore, he could have easily done an amended tax return then. Instead, he didn't say anything about the mistake as if it would go away. I am unemployed and I have no way of paying this money to the IRS! I urge everyone not to deal with H&R Block because they are scam artists! I do not have a job and I do not have $1500 to pay the IRS. I am a college student and will not be able to pay my tuition because I have to pay the IRS $1500 because of a mistake that could have been corrected in the beginning!
In 2006, I closed out my retirement. I wasn't sure how to file my income tax. H&R Block seemed like a reputable firm and they advertised they backed up their product. This year, in 2008, I received a notice from the IRS that I owed $5,000 in taxes. I called the IRS and found out, that due to a typo from the person who did my taxes, I owed $5000. When I contacted H&R Block they told me I didn't purchase the extended package that covered their making mistakes. I assumed if you hired someone to do a job, they are responsible for doing it correctly. I could understand if I held back information, but this was totally on them. Imagine having to pay a car dealer extra for a car that was put together correctly, or house that was built that wouldn't fall apart. In these economic times who has $5000 dollars. I am a single mother of six. Most are grown, I have one daughter in college, one I help with expenses when I can and a 13 year old. The banks at this time won't give Donald Trump a loan so how can I pay this back with all the fees and penalties rising up? I'm more concerned with the fact their are people out there who have gone through this themselves and thrown their hands in the air and gave up, or those who will sucked in by false advertising.
I filed my 2006 taxes with H&R Block. The person working on my taxes had to keep asking questions from others in the office. Finally she told me that I would owe the IRS. Another agent came over to help her with my filing and after working on the return indicated that I did not owe afterall and would be getting a $488.00 refund. The H&R Block charge was $202.00 for tax preparation. This was a joint return, which I don't usually file. They suggested that it would be better if I filed joint. I had all of my husband's paperwork (tax statements, etc.). My husband lives in Michigan and I drove to Michigan to pick the papers up. Apparently the first person included my husband's information. The second person came along and decided that they could do a better job of filing my taxes and somehow removed my husband's information. Needless to say I received a letter from the IRS in July 2008 indicating that I understated my income. I immediately went to the year-round H&R Block office to complain, they reworked my taxes indicating that I under reported my income. The envelope that was given to me still contained all of my husband's information. I paid them for Peace of Mind in case of an error but they do not really honor that. My tax bill for 2006 was for $5,400 (including penalties and interest). I will not be going to H&R Block again. I paid them to do my taxes properly and assumed that they had included all income on my tax return. They do not own up to their mistakes. I am paying a debt to the IRS in the amount of $200 per month and I have not filed my 2009 taxes. Because I was not aware of this debt for 2006, I received a Notice of Intent to Levy. Prior to receiving this notice, I went to the IRS office and sat for 2 hours without being called, sent 2 faxes, called on the phone only to be disconnection without speaking to anyone twice trying to resolve this issue and make payment arrangements.
This is the first time i have used H&R Block. I was filing an EZ form. Single mom with one dependant. Daycare deduction only. The elderly man i delt with was well spoken but had no idea how to process taxes on a computer. The manager ended up over his shoulder for the last half of the ordeal. They argued politly thru the whole mess which lasted over 2 hrs.!!! I was at the point of tears. And the pressure to get the Emerald card was insane. They told me I would have my money in a few days. Then they called me on Sunday to return to their office to re-enter my secret code so they could try to re-send it because it didn't go through the first time. It would be another few days they said. I recieved a call on my cell during work saying i was denied due some kind of credit issues. They gave me a number to call which turned out to be a recording. Upon contacting H&R again they said there was no number to call to get a live person or additional assistance in this matter. And that they would be keeping my @$300 and I would have to wait for the IRS to send THEM a check for my refund to pickup. This is a Charade. It is a scam. It's robbery. Had to call to make arrangments to postpone paying bills. Had to go without enough food for my family. Had to reschedule medical appts. Had to go without medication. Am considering selling some of my belongings.
I filed by 1040EZ form with H&R Block in an office on 1/21/2009 at around 7:30 PM. I applied for the RAL. At 9 AM today, 1/22/2009, my check was back and ready to be picked up. VERY FAST SERVICE. My experience was a very good one.
I have filed my taxes with H & R Block since I was 16 yrs. old, I am now 29 and am filing my 2008 tax return, it was the most two frustrating days I have ever had. First, I had to ask the tax specialist not to say my social security number aloud every time she went to type it in with all the customers in the store. Secondly, the professionalism was non-existent; she talked to other tax specialists in general conversation and had to go back several times because the red flags kept popping up from her inputting the wrong information in their system. Next, another tax specialist had to come and walk her through the majority of the preparation which had me in awe because their software is self-explanatory. So we got done with the preparation of my taxes and I left feeling very unsatisfied. The next day I received a call saying that the IRS had flagged my return due to my name not matching my social security number, keep in mind I filed rapid and was expecting my return on this day but that was delayed. So after receiving this phone call, I called the location where I got my taxes done and told them what was going on and I sware someone hated me because I had to deal with this same tax specialist, she yelled across the room to another worker my name and the situation and asked how to fix it, again I could not believe it now she was yelling out my business but thank God this time I was not in there so no one would know who I was hopefully, now here is the killer part , though I called to get this matter cleared up, this lady tells me that I needed to come back to the store because she gave me forms she should have kept. Ok, now I am heated, my blood is boiling and I am about to get out of my usual easy-going self. I drove all the way back over there to give her the forms and just dropped them off at the desk because I could not deal with her anymore. Now on H & R's website it states "At H&R Block your satisfaction is guaranteed", but check this out there is no place for comments or complaints on their website nor is there a number, imagine that. So instead I call customer support to find out where I would go or call to give feedback on their services, customer support answers and I ask for the website or number to give feedback about the services, after 15 minutes of searching and speaking with his supervisor come to find out there is no such thing but there is a satisfaction guaranteed statement, IMAGINE THAT! I then ask for the corporate office phone number and after 5 minutes he gave me a 1-866 number that did not exist, ok Im ticked now, so I hang up and call back to speak with a different customer support agent and asked if I could speak with a supervisor, he tries to get me to explain my problem but I told him I already explained that for over 20 minutes with another customer support agent and now I would like to speak directly to a supervisor, again I was put on hold for 5-8 minutes just for him to come back and say there are no supervisors available, at that time I just hung up, AGAIN. Even though I have been going to this company for all these years, this experience was just enough to make me never use their services again and I took several friends with me.
I have been a faithful customer of H&R Block for a couple of years. During Christmas I went to H&R Block and was approved for the $500 emerald credit line. I went back in January to have my taxes done which they charged me over $200. I paid to do the rapid refund where I would get my money back in 1 to 2 days. First I called up there to see if my check was in and the lady I spoke to told me yes. About 5 minutes later I received a phone call from them saying my check will not be here until 2 weeks later. I asked why and the lady could'nt give me a straight answer. First she told me that the bank denied my loan and I asked why because I have been using them for years. She couldn't tell me why. Then about an hour later I got another call from them saying the reason why my check didn't come in was because the irs was holding my refund, I don't know why they could by holding my refund I do not owe them any money. They seem very suspious at H&R Block. Three different times I spoke to someone at the office and they told me something different.
I went in to get my taxes done--it took over 1 hr-and right before Joe finished the computer crashed, so it never went through. i took off work early to get my taxes done that day. a huge inconvience. h&r block should make sure their tax systems are working before they schedule customers to come in a do their taxes.
I file my taxes last year in 01-30-08. because I needed the money fast. I filed them electronicly and they charged me over 400 dollars. I told them I wanted to claim for child care assistance and for some reason they said they had to mail them. so they file my normal taxes electronicly and they the other ones by mail. I got my money like they said in two days but they told me I was going to get 1320 dollars for the other one and I never did, I went back to their office a few months after they did my taxes to tell them I had no money yet and they checked in the computer and told me that the IRS had received my paper work and that I should call them. for one reason or another I wasent able to talk to the IRS till yesterday and what the lady told me was that yes they got the paper work except for one form and that they could not process my taxes with out it. I call H&R today and S. Hamel was off but Elizabeth told me that she was going to give me that form so I can mail it tomorrow or to call the IRS and asked for a Fax # so she can Faxed it directly, I did not have to go thru all this just because that lady forgot to mail a form I was suppos to pay my mobile home with part of that money and couldnt. got behind on rent payments and might not seem a lot of money but for a mother of 3 girls with no help from a husbad (at that moment) it was hard to break promises to my doghters that I had maid because the money never got to me.
When I went to H&R Block I was greeted by Lisa who was very nice and seemed to know what she was talking about, but in all truth she didn't know anything about taxes. I went in with 2 W-2s, 1099-G, and 2 1099-Div. She then started to do my taxes and in a matter of an hour she was done and I was lucky enough to receive a large refund of $1259 which is a sizeable chunk for a college student. After the refund then everything seemed to go downhill from there. My fees which I was quoted for somewhere in the range of 250 which seemed pretty reasonable. I knew I could get them done cheaper somewhere else but H&R Block I've been with since 16. Come to the end after finding out what my refund was my fees magically jumped to 558 dollars!!!! I asked how they could jump over 100% but she said that it was to do with all the complex forms and the schedules. I agreed but somehow knew they overcharged me but then I didn't know much about taxes and took her word for it. They were the "professionals" and I wasn't. Then later I come to find in the mail that the IRS was sending me "love letters" aka audit letters saying that I owed them $3600 now. I overpaid to have my taxes done and now I owed money which completely screwed up my day. I called H&R Block so see what happened and got hung up on repeatetely and was called a liar and a cheat while accusing me that I gave them the wrong information. They had the documents and somehow I was the screwup. Tired of pulling out my hair I drove to Jackson Hewitt where they said they would look at it for FREE and see what they could do. They said that Lisa didn't put anything in correctly. To sum up what they said is that I could write off my gambling up to the amount of my winnings, put the correct amount of income(13000 to the 1300 they put in) and actually did other deductions that Lisa didn't even ask me about. I was able to write off my tution, books, and other expenses. After Walter(The Jackson Hewitt person) fixed my return and sent an amended on in I was to receive about $3200 refund instead of owing. From now on I will always go to Jackson Hewitt and now I get their Gold Gaurantee that if they screw up they will give me up to $5000 if it's their fault.
FILED TAXES 2006 Got the refund anticipation loan after all the fees were deducted and they gave our papers back, about 2-3 months later we get a bill for $36.00. They claimed we still owed the fee for the loan which had been paid upfront out of the loan the day we got it.After several calls they then said the preparer had forgotten something & we still owed the difference of $36. we disputed it since we had already paid out of the refund & the anticipation loan. They still are saying we owe it after 2 years disputing it. I would NEVER refer anyone to them I think they are crooked and the preparer was trying to get extra money for something which we never were explained what it was. Tax preparers don't return your paperwork if you still owe them. We feel cheated
I have had my taxes done at H&R Block for 20 years. Last year, they did my taxes wrong. No one would fix them. They tried to charge me a $379 fee for my taxes. I paid for the extra service that would guarantee my taxes were done right. No go. Not only did they do nothing about my taxes, I had to redo them on my own, they wouldn't back off the charge either. Well, I am not paying it and they did send me a gift certificate for this year for $50. I will not send anyone there I know and someone should do something about them.
I have been a customer for at least 40 years. I have no problem with services, but why are discounts only offered to new customers and not to past loyal customers? Other than phone I know o fno other way to file my complaint. Rising cost of fees.
We were told we would get a state and federal amount and after one large one came correct, we didn't get the state so we waited and waited and then we get an audit form, we waited and they came back to say they were off by a couple thousand dollars. We bought the peace of mind and it doesn't count for them to promise and amount and not actually get it. It was devastating we took a trip waiting to pay off a bill with our next return that never came, even bought a car. We were so upset by the loss, just expecting it is hard. I could have saved $400 and messed it up myself!
H & R Block in Calgary AB (Carol Benjaminson - Senior Tax Specialist) filed a 2007 return without my consent. My common law husband took all the information into the office, they did up the returns for both of us,he had to sign for his and was asked if he was signing for me or was she. In the past I have been required to sign my own return. This time he was told not to worry about it she (C Benjaminson would take care of it) She did not sign the return but she did submit it to Rev Canada without me seeing or varifying the return. Not even a phone call to see if in fact my common law husband and I were together. I have been in touch with countless employees of H & R Block everyone one from receptionists to district managers to regional managers to customer service to Senior paralegals(R Akers) and todate have been offered a refund for the service they provided. I returned that because I didn't pay for it, now they have sent me a certificate for this years taxes. As if I would use their service again. LOL I have been told they have security measures in place and that you have to sign the return.When I told them I never sign the return, that I was in another province I was told I must be mistaken,they appologise for any frustration I have occured but todate have not addressed my complaint, which is simple. They filed a return in my name without my consent. What do I do? How many people out there are in the same situation. I wasn't but could have been in a real fix. Do they have the right to file a return without my cosent or with out my signature?
I went to h@r block last year and got the emerald advance then went back with my w2 on feb 1st. I was told I would get my money in 1-2 days. I put a deposit on a car I was going to purchase. My money did not show up for 2 weeks. I could of done my own taxes and waited weeks for free. H@R block charged me something like 300. They lied saying it would be 1-2 days. They refused to refund my preparation fees.
I would like to discuss my experiance at one of your offices here in Kalamazoo Michigan.I went to H&R Block to get my taxes amended for 2005 I picked up my taxes in Sept 2008,mailed them off.I recieved a letter from the Federal in October 2008,stating that one of my dependents name did not match up with the soc # went back to H&R to have that corrected a mistake that was made by Mary which could have been avoided if she would have checked her work before releaseing the documents to me. I mailed them back in November 4, 2008.I spoke with the IRS today and they state that my taxes was not done correctly and that I am not entitiled to any other money. Mary did my taxes which gave me 1,574.00 approx.I did pay for my Michigan return also which I have recieved a letter back from them stating that the form for my rent credit was not included and therefore my taxes are being held until they receive that form.Since dealing with H&R my taxes are constantly being held up and rejected. I would appreciate your prompt attention regardinging this matter.I would request that my taxes be done over to see where the error is and I also would like to request my payment back for all the inconvenience. The economic/physical damage is I have paid fortaxes to be prepared and not receiving that right ther is a hardship.
I had H&R Block prepare four years of my taxes, 3 of which were done incorrectly, and then had to be ammended, which they did, but also incorrectly, so I ended up having to pay, but also interest and penalties etc, and ended up with a judgement against me becuase H&R block showed that I did not owe any taxes, but that is not how the Dept of Revenue had it. Evetually H&R block admitted they did it incorrectly, but said it was a data entry error and that they did not cover that, even though it was their staff doing data entry, and even though I had peace of mind coverage. In addition the staff who prepared my taxes initally did not mail my taxes until June, so I ended up with other penalties. They do not stand by their work and do not provide effective services. They offered 100 off my next service, but obviously I do not feel that it would be in my best interest to have them prepare my taxes again This has caused a judgement on my credit, taxes, fees, penalties and interest that I now have to pay, H&R block is still deciding what they are responsible for, In addition I went ot them to make things quick and easy, this has caused so much extra effort time and expense on my behalf. H & R block also is very poor about returning calls and following up, making it even lengthier.
Took out a hardship loan to save my home which was being forclosed. When I took papers to have taxes done, I also took them the 1099. The 1099 was attached to the paperwork along with my W2 but was not put in on the computer. Now 10 months later I receive a letter from the IRS stating that I owe over $3,000 dollars. I do not have that kind of money. I do not own a car, home and my place of employment is closing and moving out of state so I will be out of a job. I feel H&R Block should be held responsible as I paid them to do it correctly and they didn't. They signed the return stating everything was correct when it wasn't.
In September 2008 I received a notice form the IRS stating that my 2006 taxes were not filed properly and that I was over paid and therfore owe them $502.00. I was devistated and was not sure what to do. But remembering the Piece of Mind insurance I purchased when filing my taxes I was certain I would have nothing to worry about. I must say I was wrong its been since October 18, 2008 since I have filed this claim in which I was told by the H&R rep. Bob P. that it was an error on there behalf and that after filing the amendment I should receive payment within 4 to six weeks. This claim is currently still being reviewed by the corporate office and each time I call to check the status or see if there is anything I can do to speed up the process I get the run around as well as being told the information is being pushed off to other individuals. I must say my feelings towards the security I once felt has been diminished by not only the treatment I have recived but there incompetance of certain information when preparing ones taxes. If they took as much time preparing the ones taxes as they did when its time for them to pay for there mistakes there would be no need for one to pay for a piece of headache. Not to mention they don't even contact you to review whats going on they make there own assumptions. This is not fare.
H&R Block made an error when entering federal witholding on tax return for 2006, entering $700.00 more than should have increasing my tax return for more than it should have been. Now the IRS would like those tax funds back, understandably. Since I purchased the Peace of Mind insurance to cover any errors made by H&R Block, I feel they should honor my claim, and pay the tax requested by the IRS. They have denied my claim, saying it is not covered. Yet they sent me a check for $72.00 to cover penalties and interest. If my claim is not valid, why then send me a check with a letter saying that by cashing said check settles all claims with H&R Block? I now owe the IRS $690.00 for which I have made payment arrangements for.
November 24 2008 applied and was approved for an advanced line of credit in the amount of $800. On that day my emerald card was loaded with $700 $45 for annual fee and $55 for future transfer. Tried later to transfer $55 and was told systems are down call back. On 12/11 as I shop, I checked my balance and it was $0 H&R Block said that I was not suppose to get $800 due a line credit I had received. Since I got the mo repay money I had to repay it. I have been using Block for 8 years and this is the thanks of card services states that my approval for $800 was a systematic error she nor Linda could explain why I was given too much money. I have spoken to Nancy with public affairs and she made me feel as if I was in her way. I wanted send my letter to the Board Of Directors but I needed the address @ 3:45pm est she asked me to call her back in 5 min beause her other phone was ringing.
I have had problems with my emerald card and the line of credit. I lost my old card, so I went and got a new one. My old card had a balance of 57$ on it. I called the help line to get them to transfer the funds and they said I needed to fill out the correct paper work and that it shouldnt take but 48 hours. Well thats what I did and I have been waiting on them to transfer the money for a week and half now! Every time I call up there they hang up on me and some one always tells me something different. Everytime I asked to speak to the supervisor they just [run] me around. The supervisor hung up on me and so has all the [others]. I will not do my taxes again with H&R block. Which is a sad thing for me considering I've done my taxes with them since Ive had a job. My additude towards them is the worst. They need to learn how to talk to customers and learn how to do there job. Ive had to wait near two weeks just for them to put 57$ on another card. when the information is right infront of them. Clueless agents.
I too recently applied and was denied the Emerald Advance holiday loan. I have been with H & R block for 6 years and my refunds always average $5000 or more. I participated last year in the program and paid my loan back on time and with no problems. H & R Block sent me a letter INVITING me to return to the office this year and open up another line of credit advance. They even advertised that you the anount would be raised to $1000 instead of $500. I drove over an hour away to the nearest office, waited for 2 hours as I watched customer after customer get denied. They never advised anyone that they would be performing credit checks this year. If they had only advised their customers of this ahead of time, most probably wouldn't have even applied. I didn't know they were going to do that, I certainly am not happy with another inquiry on my credit report. H & R Block failed to inform anyone that their program had changed. I can only imagine the millions of people who depend on this loan for Thanksgiving and or Christmas. I hope everyone decides to file their taxes with another company. They were wrong to do their loyal customers this way. We depend on this loan to pay bills, buy groceries, or just for extra Christmas money. I wanted to use the funds to fix my car and I depended on it.
My husband and Went to them to get the advance they have been doing for a few years and we have gotten it every year but this one! Now they are doing credit check on everyone well who in there right mind would pay money put the money on a card? Then pay to use the and like paay $300.00 in fees ect. We have been giong to them for some time and are very upset that they never told us about a credit check and the only reson we went to them is that they offered that to we were even sent aletter stating EXCLSIVELY for John and Alison just bring your pay check stub and I.D. thats it! No one at there offices could tell us anything! So the next day they told us to come back and they would redo the app. boy was that a wase of time they were calling all over and did't know much of what to do needless to say we drove about 30mins from our house to do this! EVERYONE in that place was getting turned down! We counted on that money to pay some over due bills and X-MAS for the kids witch we are not going to be able to do and most of all the RENT now we don't have any other money in the bank and our kids will ahve to a tax retunr X-MAS as I'm sure alot of other family will have to do this year cuz of them they miss led us into beleaving that would get this. Not even in the letter dose it say credit check NOTHING at all!
I've been dealing with H&R Block for about 6 years and i wasnt gonna do it this year but with being laid off of my job i really needed the extra money for the holidays and bills. And since ive gotten the early tax return the 2 previous years i figured why not 1 more year i really could use the money but after me and my wife applyed they told me that i would be denied to geather we made over 30,000 but since im on unemployment we had to use here job well she wont make 10,000 this year and we didnt pass the credit check. i feel blind sided buy this and think its [bad] because they rep told us that as is with other write offs we would get back over 5500 so someone tell me why that dont make me eligable for it. not to mention ive payed back every other loan they gave me. but like everyone else i will not be retuning now or ever.
Each year, H&R Block has offered a Holiday Loan in November and December which is paid back by withdrawing what you owed on the loan from your tax return the following spring. For five years we have participated in this Holiday Loan and remained with H&R Block BECAUSE the loan has helped us out so much in the holiday season. Without fault, we have paid this money back all five years. We are aware of the fact that if we wanted to avoid paying this money back, we could have easily had our taxes prepared by a private source who would not take out the loan money. By doing this, we could have avoided continuing paying $450 dollars to H&R Block each tax season. We NEVER would have done such a thing and thus, have continued doing business with the Block and paying UNGODLY charges to do the simple paperwork. This year, the loan was set to begin on November 20th, my only child's 12th birthday. We made the FIRST appointment available and arrived at the Block fifteen minutes early. On arrival, we were asked if we met the following criteria: pay stubs showing at least $10,000 in earnings for the year. Valid photo ID Well we obviously met the criteria, and have ALL five years. It's usually a fairly breezy process; in and out in about twenty minutes. This year was different to say the least. After the paperwork was filled out, our estimated refund for 2008 was quoted at 3,800 dollars. The holiday advance is for one thousand. Paperwork was electronically submitted and then NOT APPROVED. Why? Who knows, no one has yet even taken the time to answer this question for me. We were given a phone number (loosely used) and told by calling the number we would be given a reason why this did not go through. The tax preparer claimed to be shocked and stated WOW, you guys have been approved every year! I've never heard of such a thing! When we called this 800 number to get some answers we discovered quickly that this is a generic number that is a pre-recorded message basically saying you weren't approved, you'll find out why when we send you something in 6-8 weeks. The number then hangs up on you with no option to speak to anyone. Consequently, our daughter received NOTHING from us on her twelfth birthday. I am not an ignorant person and never rely on something that is not for SURE but FIVE STRAIGHT YEARS WAS FOR SURE! We trusted H&R Block, we have been loyal. SHAME ON US.
I have used H&R block for many years and I have nothing but excellent results. I have also prepared my own taxes and had the company review them. They found items to save me money. I had not understood the questions in the TurboTax interview. While one tax professional was fairly new and a bit slower, her results were perfect. Tax professionals have taught me to keep good records and to plan ahead. I have found that communication is the key to a successful return. I ask lots of questions, all of which have been answered to my satisfaction. My husband did our taxes for several years and I simply signed. That was a mistake; he cost us a great deal of money because he did not pay attention to detail! I was able to ammend only three years prior returns and our refunds were substantial. We had Sch A, B, C, D, E, Installment sales, and self employment w/expenses and office in home. H&R Block rocks!
H&R Block prepared our federal and state tax returns for 2006. We donated a house to the City of Virginia Beach Fire Department. The fire department trained on the property and in the house. The fire department broke windows, destroyed walls, cut holes in the roof, etc. H&R Block claimed the contribution on our returns, the IRS disallowed the deduction. We purchased the Peace of Mind Plan, we made the claim through our local office (Lynnhaven Mall), it was denied. H&R Block claims that we provided misleading, inaccurate or false information. We trusted H&R Block, a tax expert to do our taxes and they failed. What is most disturbing to us is they made a mistake and now they refuse to do the RIGHT thing and correct their mistake. Back taxes, penalties and interest of almost $4000.00
I went in to H & R Block and applied for a RAL. They told me APROXIMATELY how much money I should get back from my taxes and then said how much they could offer me in a loan. And I was happy with the loan amount because I wanted just to get some back so I would still get plenty back when my refund actually did come back. Well when I went back in for them to do my actual taxes I was horrified when they told me that i was getting quite a bit less back then what was quoted to me previously. Now I understand that it is an aproximate figure that they give you, but this was a difference of hundreds of dollars. I will never go back to H & R Block again. I ended up haveing to pay money back on the loan out of my pocket. I wanted H & R Block to pay for my loan, but they refused.
My taxes for 2006 costed me $272 to get done by H&R Block. I went back the following year, on March 25, 2008, to get my taxes for 2007 done. I went to the same person and she did the same thing and then surprised me with a $107 inflation fee for a total of $379! As I wrote out the check I let her know of my displeasure about the overly priced service and she gave me some spew off about why it was so much higher but I don't remember anymore. She scanned the check in her little machine, wrote VOID in big bold letters on it, and handed it back to me. She told me she didn't need the check and the scanner machine thing took care of it. So I put the check in my pocket and left... very upset of course. Come August I get a letter in the mail from my county prosecuting attorney stating that I was being charged with a crime and I would need to get an attorney for court, take financial management classes and pay nearly $600. I called the number on the letter to see what the deal was. Apparantly, H&R Block's little scanner machine didn't work right and it never took their money. So instead of contacting me about it they waited a couple months and then submitted a false claim against me with my county prosecuting attorney stating that I wrote a fraudulant check to H&R Block. After two months of fighting back and forth with the Prosecuting Attorney replying to threatening letters, calling them, etc. I finally got the P.A. to realize that I have never wrote a fraudulant check and sent them a letter from my bank stating so with the check number and account number. My bank stated that the account of the issued check is valid and has never had a NSF hit in the past 2 years. However, now the P.A. wants me to pay an additional $35 fee on top of the $379. This is not fair. Not only was I treated like a criminal for H&R Block's false claims against me, I was in distress for 2 months trying to get this mess worked out so I didn't have to pay $600 in fees, take a financial management class which who knows how much that would have costed, and mainly not have to worry about going to jail! This company, H&R Block, should not be able to get away with this.
My husband and I went with our W-2's to get our taxes done. We needed to wait a month or two to finish the paperwork because I had a tax offset due to my student loan default. She told us to come back when that was released. I called to get them finished and they had lost all paper trail that we had been there. They had it all on the computer but no paperwork. Ginger spent time looking for it but never found it. I asked her what they would do and she told me to go back to all the places of employment and get copies of our W-2's. They would give us some kind of discount for our inconvenience. We would then have to wait for the former employers to get copies to us and we now have to wait another 8-12 weeks for our refund. She talked with the woman who was very old who put it in the computer and she couldn't remember anything or where the papers might be. We had to find phone numbers and make several calls to get copies of W-2's and then wait ove 2 weeks to get them and then we have to wait 8-12 weeks for our refund.
I just discovered that a significant error was made by the tax preparer at H&R Block for my 2003 federal return that made me liable in error for almost $2000. Today I am mailing a letter to the office where this occurred as well as a copy to the CEO of H&R Block. Upon reading some comments of consumer problems, I am sure that they will not take this matter seriously, since the 3 year limit for filing an amended return has passed. Because of their error, I am out almost $2000!!
I wish to be a part of the class action lawsuit against H&R Block that I received a claim from via US mail. They charged exuberant amount of money to e-file my tax returns for several years until I found I could e-file myself for free.
I had Kathleen ** do my taxes in 2006 at the Walmart office. I took my taxes from the past 5 years to have them looked over for mistakes also. I got a letter from the IRS some time before I had my 2007 taxes done and brought it to Kathleen's attention. She had put on my 2006 taxes as claiming my daughter Brittny which my ex-husband has done since our divorce 12 years prior, I have always filed as head of household not as claiming her. Had to send in an amended return which in turn says I owe state $109.95 & Federal $1564.43 for her mistake. I have never in the past had a problem with my returns. I have my taxes prepared by a professional so this does not happen. She had 5 years of my prior returns. She should have caught her mistake if she even would have looked at them. She called me a few weeks later and asked me to pick them up that she found no mistakes. I want someone to take care of this as it was not my fault. I have contacted Kathleen but have not heard a word from her. I expect to hear from someone regarding this matter soon.

I live my life everyday tring to do the right thing, please help
I filed my taxes with H&R Block in 2008, and I said that I want direct deposit this year so I would get my Economic Stimulus Payment Refund sooner, and I was told I would get it. On May 16, 2008 I did not get the Economic Stimulus Payment Refund sooner. I called the IRS the next day and was told that H&R Block put my Social Security Number down as the bank rounting number. So now I will not get my check for another two months. This has cause undue delys in my plans. How can H&R Block put my Social Security Number down as the bank rounting number? I understand that H&R Block wants there money first to take out there fees then refund the rest. However, knowing there was a Economic Stimulus Payment Refund, H&R Block should have had plans for this and another paper or something filled out. This is poor. I have files a BBB and attorney general complaints. H&R Block says they did not put mu S.S. as the bank number. I was told by the IRS they did. Had to wait month(s) longer then I should have to get the money. I was told by H&R Block I would get it sooner by direct deposit and not by check, as I did get it by check because they give the wrong info.
NEVER GOT MONEY FROM CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT
I received a letter stating I owed taxes for the year 2005. When I had H & R Block do my taxes I paid extra money in case the IRS ever came back to me. H & R Block would take care of it. He redid my tax return and I paid over $1,000.00. A few months later I received another letter from the IRS stating I owed them more money. I once again contacted Horris Brown in April and never heard back from him. I have called numerous H & R Block offices in Jersey City, Hoboken and Secaucus, New Jersey seeking Horris and some help. No one has ever called back. How could I owe the IRS over $3,000.00 in taxes when I only made $30,000.00 that year. I am now being sent notices and the penalty fees are adding up. Over $3,000.00 paid in taxes because of H&R Block.
I felt confident as I walked into the HR Block office to have my tax return prepared in late January. I was even lucky enough to have the office manager himself do the return. As he was working through the return it struck me as a bit odd and alarming that he seemed to have difficulty with my simple return forms. He also talked and joked incessantly with co-workers as he stammered along with my return . I noticed he didnt include my daycare or mortgage interest as was normally done in prior years so I asked him about it . He assured me it couldnt be used on my return. I asked 3 times - each time he said it wouldnt be applicable. It continued to bother me , I just felt so strongly that he was wrong so I called and talked with another preparer there and met with her . I showed he my prior year return and she agreed - yes - it should have been claimed on my state return. I was not offered a refund of my fee, but I asked for and got the refund. Realizing the error is theirs, they make the correction ( the original preparer told me to come back in MARCH). Then lo and behold I get a letter from the IRS they cannot process my amendment because it was not sent with the correct forms. This is ridiculous. Now it is late April and the office I went to is closed - they advise me I have to drive 45 miles to the closest open office to have this amendment corrected. By now Im interested in arbitration, I want some kind of restitution for this hoop jumping act I am forced to perform. Meanwhile gas prices are skyrocketing. I did go this distant office - they tried to claim it was the IRS that is the actual instigator of this problem, and they send my corrected amendment. I have called this office numerous times for three months trying to get some information on opening an arbitration case. They dont answer the phone most of the time, and when they do they tell me I have to talk to a person who is conveniently not in today . Something has to be done or they will continue their circus act under the guise of being so accurate they guarantee it Where is this guarantee ???? I am looking for a lawsuit against them , and will not rest until I find one. I have spent undue time , money and sleepless nights in frustration.
I was and still am being told that I owe money for services that I never had since I never used h&r because of what I was told by a person that took the shady course that left room for irs not to audit with a service fee to back u up in case of court. I am 69 and was told it was me and nothing I said was ok, even when I called corporate I was asked for my social so she could look up my file and when I said I am not in your system she insisted I give my social and she would look at my case.I get calls each weed with a recording for me to call a toll free number and get no where again. I am upset being told I am who they wish me to be and this is very upsetting for some one age 69 being called a liar.
I had my taxes done. I was given a coupon for $15. All I have to do is to refer a friend and we would both get $15 each. My friend had Lana do his taxes too. (which were all messed up). To this date we have not received the $30. I have called, left messages which went unreturned. I called their customer service, and was told they dont handle the coupons and HR Block corporate would call me within 48 hours. This was 4-5 days ago. I know it's not much in dollar sense, but its the honesty. I feel cheated. I will call them again. I too am a consumer advocate. I only want what is right.

After weighting 10 weeks to get my state refund.I contated the superviser found out that my address was worng it wes a prepears mastake.and was given my money back for the state taxes.

I had called H&R block for assistant. After explaining my issue and problem to the associate (which was very pleasant) she said that she will need to get somebody to further help me with my problem by transferring me to tech or whatever department that will assist me by walking me through. I got transferred to the investment broker which i wasn't aware until explaining about my issue and he advised he will have to transfer me again to the right department. I was once transferred to a third partnership which was a nice lady...and said that she wasn't able to assist me because i was transferred to the wrong department again. I was told that minimize my topic of issue and instead of having one of the h&r block associate help me, ask for a supervisor. I had called H&R block once more 1-800hrblock and rashard who answered the phone asked how he could assist me. I calmly said hello, yes can i please speak to a supervisor. he replied well before i transfer you can i try to help you with your issue. I said no that i reallly just rather speak to a supervisor. Puts me on hold and comes back and says...can you explain what is the issue about because the supervisor will not come to the phone unless the problem was addressed. I got frustrated and told him that because of the problem with the supervisor not coming to the phone to resolve issue is my problem at this time. I told him, i wasn't mad at him but now i'm frustrated that the supervisor is refusing to come when a customer ask to talk to him/her. I told him that an irate customer is the issue of why a supervisor is needed at this time. He comes back and says i'm sorry, but i will have to try to help you because the supervisor is not coming until the a reason was givin. AT this time i was furious. I told him i have been transfered 4 times to different department and was tired of repeating my problem and that i rather talk to a supervisor and i cannot believe that a supervisor refusses to come and help a customer who has been doing taxes with them since 2000. I felt as if they were playing games or just wanted to make my day worse than it already has been. I told the customer representative that i was not upset with him, but i am furious now at this point and i do not blame him and i really, really rather just speak with the supervisor. He replied to me well I understand we get a lot of irate customers all the time and before a supervisor can assist you it is my job to try to help you. I replied, well im not mad at you but im just tired of repeating my self, and that i just rather just deal with the supervisor. Unfortunately he says if he can't not help me is there anything else he can assist me since a supervisor is not available. I asked him for a corporate number and he said they didn't have one, but he can fill a complaint form. trying to view w2forms on line to retrieve a 401k that i can't find. I called previous jobs and companys that i was told to call and even though they couldn't find my account they had all my information and the advise they told me was to go through w2 from previous yeears and that should tell me what year i had contribute to 401k or if i ever did contribute.
I prepared my 2008 tax services with H & R Block Premium @ Penfield NY location. The reason I took it there and pay more money because they claimed they are the best and check every dimension of your taxes, and if they make a mistake they grantee to help you. Surprisingly, last month I received a letter from government that you owe us $7000. When I called back the H & R block representative and address the problem after she reviewed she indicated the it was her fault and made mistake due to the personal problem last year. If a representative of H & R block have personal problems and not ready to service clients , they should stay at home! The reason I pay more and selected tax specialist is to expect to do the quality services! I am dissatisfied with this company and would not retune to the group of H & R block any more! HAVE TO PAY $7000
In April of 2008, I went to a scheduled appointment at the H & R Block office here in town. The person who looked over my tax information was not sure what to do with it, so she asked if she could pass this paperwork on to another person in the office and have her do my taxes. I said of course, that's fine. Fast forward to appointment with other person. Other person isn't sure what to do with my taxes either. She needs to file an extension for me so that she can investigate a few things. Ok with me. 3 weeks later, I had not heard back from other person so I gave her a call. The answer was she was looking into things, had a couple calls in the works, and she'd get back to me. Fast forward another 2 weeks or so. I made another call to the office, and again, got some more excuses. Note that along with the excuses, I had to re-explain to her certain points about my taxes. Things she should have remembered or at the very least, have written down. I really REALLY dislike having to repeat myself! Fast forward past another phone call or three-- it's now over 2 months later. Now my taxes are going to be done by the guy who owns the office since otherperson just didn't know what to do with them. Another 2 weeks and a couple days pass with nothing heard from owner guy. I call the office-- again-- and other person says either she or owner guy will call me back that day. No one calls me back of course. Next day I call the office-- again. Other person gives me the direct number of owner guy. I call ownerguy and he apologizes to me for not getting to my taxes. He said he would pick up the form (notice how nothing has been done with my taxes yet?) and have them done. I said I wanted them in a week, that I was tired of waiting. I then thought things through a bit more and called a local cpa. She could have my taxes done in a day, that what needed to be done was easy and she didn't understand why H & R Block was having such a difficult time of things. I then called H & R Block and said thanks but no thanks, I want my tax information back-- I'm tired of waiting. 3 months had already passed since my taxes would have been due without the extension. A week later I finally got my tax information back from them (even that took them time...). The CPA has easily and quickly taken care of my taxes in a couple of days and I look forward to my tax return arriving sometime in the near future. At the 3 month mark in all this I also called corporate H & R Block. I got some random customer service person. When I explained that I was dissatisfied with the office here in town, she didn't say anything. I said let me guess, there's nothing you can do about it? She said yes, there's nothing they can do about it. Thank you H & R Block for not standing behind your company name. I will never EVER set foot in one of your offices again, and should anyone ever ask about your company and/or services, I will gladly recommend them to someone else. Delayed tax return and delayed stimulus payment. Not to mention a three month long headache!
After visiting H & R Block on March 15th, a month ahead of the tax deadline, we filed our income tax forms, and were pleased to learn we'd get a decent return. There seemed to be no incident at that time, but we were called the next business day and were told there was a problem with my son's SSN. It was corrected over the phone, and we went about our day. Expecting my refund in 2-3 weeks, I called their office 4 weeks later asking if there was a problem. It's now close to the filing deadline, so we go into the office. It seems nothing was done after the SSN issue, but now that it's 2 days until the filing deadline, they do not want to resubmit. They print out my documents, hand me an envelope (all without their name on it) and advise me to mail it in myself. I can only imagine what would have happened had I not called when I did. Now it's the end of July, I have to refile all my information with the IRS directly because my forms lacked supporting information on a number of items (a low grade audit, I guess), and H & R Block customer service is like talking to a wall. Not that I expect them to do anything other than admit it was poor service. They state At H&R Block your satisfaction is guaranteed, but despite their complete failure to file my taxes, or satisfy me as a customer, it did not keep them from keeping my money.
We used the services of H&R Block, Wentzville (falling under the St Charles, MO office) for our 2006 tax return. We purchased their Peace of Mind guarantee at the time. We were audited by the IRS for the tax return and it was revealed that H&R Block made substantial errors in the return totalling over $13, 840 which we were informed we now owed. When we filed in 2006 H&R we originally refunded by federal and state (California) authorities over $6, 300. So we now had to return not only the $6, 300+ we had been refunded but also an additional $7, 000+. We needed to pay the IRS $9, 712 - and we are told to expect, due to the errors, that the states of CA and MO will claim from us another additional $1, 900 when they are finished assessing the new filing. H&R Block admitted the very significant mistake (and in actual fact, in the process of determining the new, correct amount owed, discovered another basic but substantial error in their calculations and methods - while this resulted in less owed, it still underlines the fact that they made two very large errors). H&R Block honored the Peace of Mind guarantee by paying us (June 12, 2008) a check for $7, 330.47. This included their standard guarantee for penalty and interest ($2, 300, 47) plus the maximum allowed under the guarantee of $5, 000. In short, we still needed to pay $9, 712. H&R Block legal department has written to us (Regina, Senior Paralegal) to inform us that they will not consider additional payments above and beyond what their Peace of Mind guarantee promises. Letter dated July 18, 2008. We believe this is unacceptable. Never in our wildest imagination, and I gather from discussions I have had with H&R Block representatives, that such substantial errors should ever be made by a professional tax prepare. We are out of pocket to the tune of over $13,000 when we cannot afford to pay.
I had contacted H&R.Block to inform them that the previous lender Mariners Capital had defrauded me out of $31,000.00, and and failed to apply the funds to laon with the new lender Option One. they did send me proof that the payments were being made then they told me to get the funds from my broker. I had a rep from H&R. Block on the phone and she heard the entire conversation H&R. BLock stated that theywere going to look into getting the funds applied. As you know they sold the company! Their Failure to intervene caused my house to go into default and Option One their company was trying to foreclose. I have recipts and records, also Option One contacted me and stated that the were going to modify my loan if I agreed to the terms I did and sent them a certified letter to confirm to date I have not received any documents frrom them or H&R.Block.My health and my wife's health has been affected by this.
My husband went to H & R Block this year to prepare our taxes. We went last year and the lady we had knew what she was doing and was excellent. This year he had Philip and he didn't seem to know what he was doing at all. Then we contacted Mylissa Malone because he said we owed the govt. 2,633.37. He forgot to list our son as a dependent. So Mylissa did an amended tax paper. Last year the lady we had said we were going to get a bigger refund this year the way she calculated it, and this guy had us paying over 2,600.00. Cliff had his receipts and everything. We sent the amended tax for along with a letter to the IRS about the mistake. We sent the IRS tax 952.00 we owed them on the amended tax form. The IRS keeps sending letters, and then they took our 600.00 stimulus check to pay on it. They told us we were getting our stimulus check on 7/11/08. I called the IRS and she said they're still reviewing the amended tax paper. There's so many amended tax forms that came in, they take a while to process. I was counting on that stimulus check to go to my daughter's wedding. I want a refund of our preparation fee. I will not use H & R Block again, since representatives had no clue what to do and made a lot of mistakes. I have trouble paying my local school taxes and I'm behind on them and they want to take my house. My husband is a self-employed carpenter and some months of the year, we don't have hardly any work. I couldn't even give my kids a decent Christmas. The lady we had last year was fantastic and knew what she was doing. Actually she told us we'd have a bigger refund this year, and this guy has us paying out all this money we can't pay. I'm sending a 911 form in.
My wife and I, filed our taxes with a subsidiary of H & R Block, to get the stimulas check only, since I am disabled. We asked Ms. Suttles, the tax agent, if we should file injured spouse again, like we use to when we filed our regular taxes, since I owed back child support? She stated no, and that child support can't touch our stimulas check! Well, we received the usual notification from the IRS, that our check would be sent out at a certain date, but when that date came and went, we got concerned! Then, about a week later, we received a notice from child support, stating that they indeed took all of our stimulas check, including my wife and kids portion! So, I called Ms. Suttles to advise her that child support did indeed take our stimulas check. We then went back to Ms. Suttles and had to file an injured spouse form and had to pay an additional fee as well! I tried to file a complaint with H&R Block on their web site, but there is no place on their site to file a complaint! Not only do we have to wait an additional 8 weeks to see if we even get a stimulas check, we also have out-standing bills that need paid as a result of not getting this check! Not to mention, having to pay extra to file an addition to our taxes!
I received a notice from the IRS that I owed money. I contacted H&R Block, whom I usually use for my tax preparation and advised them that information on my tax form was reported incorrectly, they prepared my taxed and advised me to come in. I went in on saturday 7/12/08 to ask them why information was reported incorrectly. After reviewing the documents with the office manager she stated that she was unsure why the previous tax preparer reported this incorrectly and did an amendment on the documents. I was then advised that I need to mail in my IRS form with payment back to the IRS checking the box that I owe the money. Then was advised that they were not going to pay for thier error because I didnt purchase the packet that says if H&R Block makes errors on my forms they will pay for it. I thought to myself why did I just pay $319 if I wasnt getting some degree of knowledge or professionalism? I was then told that agreement is another $45. If I was given the option to purchase such agreement I would have but if anyone was to look at my tax documents they would first see my name incorrectly. Since I am not a male it would be difficult being Cassandra, a wrong address as well as incorrect dollar amounts. I unfortunately had to much faith when I paid $319 to get my taxes done and should have listened to myself when I doubted the person doing my taxes. I was truly under the impression that paying that much money and walking through the door meant I was getting my taxes done correctly, I didnt realize it would cost more money to have someone do my taxes correctly. According to the IRS I now owe them $665 and counting. Like most people every dollar counts in my home, especially during the summer when my children are out of school and the day care expense weighs heavily on my finances.
I checked my balance on july 4th, before I went to bed, and it was $127 or $128 on the morning of July 5th I checked my balance it was $67, I had signed up for a bill to be directly withdrawn, and its amount was almost exactly $60 well I got a bill saying my payment didn't go through. When I called handrblockbank told me there was no $60 dollar charge and that my balance was 90 someod dollars on the 4th. I went online to check my transactions it wouldn't show me any information or the balance on the different days my bill isn't paid and I don't have the money to pay it because I was LIED too by HRBLOCKBANK.
I filed my individual 2007 tax return on January 21, 2008. Emily Freeman is the HR Block Representative that prepared my taxes. Emily appeared incompetent from the beginning but because HR Block is such a widely known company, I decided to give her the benefit of the doubt. Throughout the entire process she was asking help of other reps there, but me believing that patience is a virtue, continued to allow her to prepare my tax return. After the process was finished, something appeared not right to me because the expected return amount was a lot less than what I had previously figured on HRBlock.com tax calculator, so with that suspension, I advised Emily that something was wrong and she promised to have a manager look over it. With that being done, there was a definite mistake that the return Emily filed came out to be $1,240.00 less that what my return was suppose to be; so Emily supposedly redone the return in the computer at the company but did not submit an amended return to the IRS, After waiting a few weeks, I decided to call the company to check the status of the supposedly amended return only at that time to find out from the manager (Sonja Phillips) that it was incorrectly done and that she would get a form completed for me to mail into the IRS. At this point I am a little upset because here I am giving in count for someone else's mistake, which was in no way my fault. I complained to Sonja about the Rep only to find that she (Emily) was in no way held accountable for her actions. A few months later, I receive a letter from the IRS advising that they needed more information. I returned that letter to the tax preparer, HR Block-Sonja, I received it back about a week later and mailed it in to the IRS, and they received the information April 14, 2008. Because of all this, my Economic Stimulus payment was frozen as well. Here I am, months later on July 9, 2008 still without the remainder of my income tax return that I filed on January 21, 2008. I will NEVER EVER file my income taxes with H & R Block again, I advised all of my family, friends, and co-workers of the same. Its sad that such a well known company hires people with such a lack of knowledge leaving their customers in PAIN! The one major issue that I have with all of this other than the above mentioned is that I have a very important surgery that is vital to my health and well being that I was supposed to have, but it has been delayed because of the lack of funds to pay my insurance deductible, in which this money was supposed to be used for. It is very aggravating to know there are bills that I could have had paid, but I have to wait and suffer because of someone else's mistake.
I had my taxes done at H&R block and I never thought that any company could be so messed up at thier business as much as them, It has been a nightmare at its best!. I took my taxes to them and in my filing I gave them accounts that has been cashed in from my divorce. and in doing so I thought that they would understand how to handle all of it. WRONG...... First they neglected to file in the return an account worth $18,000. so I didn't know about that until the I.R.S. sends me a letter 4 months later saying the company that the account was closed from filed the account on thier taxes as paid out to me. so I go back to H&R Block. and they will look into it and call me. so after a month of no return I call them back and they say they are waiting on the I.R.S. and they will call me when they have all of the information. another month goes by and I call them again and they say what is your number and we will call you right back ( I forgot to mention this because they say that everytime and NEVER call you back) and I give them all of the information again and wait again. now 3 months go by and the I.R.S. sends me another letter about the account and now they say that I am being pentilized $1,800.00 for not filing this on my return. I call H&R Bonehead again. they have done nothing, and they tell me don't call us we will call you. I waited for 10 months and they still did not call and I call them again and they say we forgot, could you refresh our memory. Now I am outraged, so I refresh thier memory. and then they assure me and promise me they will look into this right now and get ahold of me, so let a fool I believe them. Two weeks go by and no response and I call them again and they say they havn't done it because the paperwork has been sent to another H&R branch and they will wait to get it back. So, I call thier corporate line and they could not believe it and they will pay for the penalties and interest. and they will contact them right away. soooo another week goes by and I call the corporate line again and they assured me again they wil take care of it right away. the next week H&R Block local branch call ME YEAHHH first returned call in almost a year! and the say they cannot find the paper that I gave them when I first filed my taxes with the account and They need that paper to do my account. and I tell them don't have copies or anything they say no and I need to get ahold of the investment firm again and get a copy. now keep in mind they don't know what company they neglected to file in my taxes. BUT I NEED TO FIND OUT! and get them another copy. Now I finally narrowed down who THEY LOST, and gave them another copy and now that has been over a month and I have called them Five times and I still get told we are waiting on the I.R.S. and now today I get another paper from the I.R.S. that I need to contact them to pay them $11,400.00 in taxes, penalties, and interest. I will NEVER EVER EVER use H&R Block again!they have lied and procrastinated beyond any type of belief of any company can do to thier customers. I don't know why they call themselves the tax pro's because it very clear if they computer program does'nt do they work for them they are at total lost. and in deniel of how they can help anybody.
I normally do not file taxes because I get social security survivors benefits for my children and I. I filled out the stimulus check paperwork through H&R Block in Walmart back in April 2008. Because of typos made on the form that was e-filed I did not receive a check in July. They misspelled my address street and keyed one digit difference in the zip code which caused a different town to come up. I should have caught it before I left however, I assumed the printed w2's with the correct address were provided. Due to this error, my check was sent out to nowhere and now I have to wait until it comes back to the IRS and resent to correct address. They also used the wrong form for applying for the telephone excise tax rebate. They used form 1040x which the IRS agent said is considered an amended form of 1040. It was not processed since the IRS could not find an original 1040 used by me for the previous year. Of course it doesn't exist, I don't file taxes. The IRS fixed the errors and now the payment delays ruins my vacation plans before school restarts. I am requesting a full refund of the $35 paid. A letter with specifics is being sent to the district office and I am awaiting a response.
Had to file and amended return with H and R Block was charged 40 or 50 bucks only to find at 12 weeks later they left out a form that the IRS requires, according to them. I contacted H and R block and they stated how are we suppose to know what they require if they do not tell us? I asked for refund of my money that I paid to them and the lady said, no. NEVER AGAIN will I ever go to H and R block!
H&R Block did our 2006 tax return through their temporary office in Wal-mart, Lake St Louis, MO. The return required processing data from our previous residence in California and included relocation amounts - as well as a short period of employment in MO. We took out the H&R Block Peace of Mind protection. We were audited in the first quarter of 2007 and it was proven, and accepted by H&R Block, that they (H&R) had made an error in the return totalling more than $13,400. H&R re-did the return and managed to the get the error down to $9,300 but the new return resulted in CA and MO state return errors totalling another $1,900. In the process of getting the amount owed reduced, H&R found another error of more than $3,000, which will in our 'favor' was still, nonetheless another error - a fundamental error, as was the first relocation allowance error. The total amount we need to pay back to the IRS is approximately $11,000. H&R Block's Peace of Mind protection will only cover $5,000 plus interest and penalities and will refund their fees. They have paid us this money but have indicated that they will not pay any additional amounts. We have asked them to acknowledge that deposting their checks does NOT mean we accept their payment as final, but as yet they have not done so. We have appealed to them to make an exception to their Peace of Mind 'rules' and pay the total amount we must back to the IRS. The errors they made were fundmenatal and simple - but very costly errors. We simply cannot afford to pay the difference between what H&R Block have paid and what we owe the IRS - more than $4,500. It is a financial hardship and mental and emotional problem for us we simply cannot handle at this time. We accept that the Peace of Mind agreement is reasonable in that we could possibly in a million years imagine a $5,000 error - but a $14,000 error is too much to accept.
I filed my 2007 taxes on April 11th 2008,with no problems that I was aware of,I then was a sent a letter by HR BLOCK stating that something was wrong with my taxes and I needed to contact them immediately and that they had been trying to contact me to no avail. There had not been one call placed to me by this agency prior to the notice at home or cell phone of which they had all contact numbers. When I arrived they said my claim was rejected because I did not list I was amrried file seperately (of which I did ,as this is the way me and my wife filed in the last 4years,nonetheless we corrected the error or so I thought, and was told it would once again be resubmitted,this time frame was approx 1 week after April 15th of which I have now been subjected to a penalty fee. I discovered after speaking with a IRS REP.when I called to inquire why I had not heard anything re my refund and stimulus check the rep. stated that my taxes were filed in error on April 11th and had not been submitted as corrected thus far
i have been doing my taxs with this same people for ten years or more. and the only thing that they do is get my gst or qst every time i tryed to deduct anything i was told you can't. for instance a tax refund for gas i am handycaped and i am alloud to have it they told me NO so i filled out the forms and got it myself after they told me no. now this year or the last fore years i put a second floor to rent i was told that i was sopposed to get part of the 30,000 i spent from my morage in matreal she told me NO the first year because now she told me its to late THATS ALL THEY WANT IS 70$ to get a gst cheack they don't know anything just how to get the gst figure it out 30,000$ that i spent to make a income prop. but NO deductions? i spoke to a accontent who told me i am intitled to these refunds
Paid them to complete my 2007 taxes as I have without incident for 6 years. Was sent a personal E-mail with tax information from the man who completed them! Called the office to ask why, his supervisor treated me like dirt. I asked, "What is going on?" She said, "Maybe he doesn't understand what he is doing - cut him some slack." I said, "Then find someone who does know how to prepare taxes, please - these are my taxes, not some lightweight typing assignment. Thanks." Discovered later from IRS that this office gave them their bank account information to receive MY Economic Stimulus check! They previously took out their charge from my 2007 tax return! Watch out and run.
I filed my 2006 and 2007 Taxes Jiontly with my wife and I just recieved my 2007 return for $ 1,946.00 about a week ago However I am having issues with my 2006 and I was just informed by the IRB office that I owe them over $ 7,000.00 because of a problem with our withholding taxes are not applied in the US but instead in the US Virgin Islands H & R Block was explained in both 2006 -07 that I am a retired Govt. employee of the Virgin Islands ( St.Thomas ) and that my wife works with a company from the V.I. but with a Boca Raton FL. address In both 2006-07 we were supose to get refunded but instead we have problems and I have left two or three messages with H & R Block and noone has replied H & R Block was payed for services. We migth have to pay amount that are in reason and I have submitted my taxes filed by H & bR Block to FAFSA for my sons finances and all the filing is incorrect and my wife and me are very frustrated and just want to end this ordeal. In my past 23 years I never had problems until I filed my last 2 years with H&R Block
We had started a hot shot trucking business and kept wonderful records. The person that prepared our taxes took a deduction twice for mileage. One with the actual miles and then she also took the standard mileage. They, of course audited us for the 2-3 years that we had the business, that failed. We contacted the office and said that the policy said that they handled it if anyone was audited. We were told that meant they would go to the hearing for us but for them to be financially responsible, you had to pay an additional fee, that we were NOT told about nor aware of. The woman said that she would go to the hearing, but only if she went alone. She met with them a couple of times and we ended up owing the IRS $13,000.00. We felt that this was such a horrible representation. Just a year before the audit, my husband had a mini stroke, carotid artery surgery, a stint put in his chest for blood flow, and a heart attack followed by quadruple bypass surgery. Having to pay this back is so unfair. We took our taxes to what we thought was a "professional organization" so that our taxes would be done correctly. Now we will be paying for years and years and years. Is there anything that can be done?
I went to H & R Block and had Amy filed my taxes as I didn't want to make any mistakes and mess something up. Wrong idea! I live with my fiance of @ 3 years and her 2 sons. My fiance doesn't work and she said it was ok for me to claim them as the father of the boys doesn't have legal right to claim them on his taxes. So I let her do it, and now I have HSBC calling on average of 3 times a day, 7 days a week because I did rapid refund and the IRS denied the claim. I now owe over 2800 to HSBC and 3400 to IRS. I was laid off in March and have been only working 2 weeks at my new job making almost 3 dollars less an hour and driving 30 miles round trip, which is about 28 more miles than my old job. I have 3 kids of my own that I have joint custody of and pay child support for. There is no way I am going to be able to pay all this money back. I am screwed because she failed to follow the tax laws. If I had the money to hire a lawyer, I WOULD!
When I filed my 2005 Fed taxes, the HR agent failed to include my 1099R retirement annuity. In 2007 I contacted HR Block and worked with Jane J. to file amended returns for state and Federal Government. As a result Jane agreed to pay (Via HR Block) all penalties and interest. I filed and paid my 2005 taxes-Jane initially cut me a check for the penalties for Federal Taxes of $691.00. Two months ago she was to cut another check which would settle my State and Federal Taxes Penalty and Interest. Since April 2008 she will not return my calls and still has paid the penalties and interest as she had agreed to. I had to personally show up in her office on May 5th and found out she hadn't requested the check--I have called her 3 or 4 times since 28 May to see the status of the check and she still had not cut the check. On 29 May I left messages with two office employees at her HR Block and stated that I needed her to call back ASAP and she did not. As a result of her inaction; I will not be receiving my $1200 President Bush stimulus rebate as I owe this Interest and Penalties. I have done everything I told her I would do but she has failed to comply with her written agreement!
I have called many times to get my discount certifacate that is owed to me for mistakes made on my taxes. Sharron, the district manager, never returns my calls.

I opened a savings account by putting $500 dollars on the emerald card and set up to have $50 a month taken from my personal bank account and deposited into the savings account. My first issue began with the inability to activate my card. It took weeks. I called the 1800 number on the back of the card and after being placed on hold for almost hours at a time, the person of course had no idea what to do. It took three more weeks of dealing with numerous people who had no idea what they were doing, before I finally went to the location where I had my taxes done and they got in touch with the correct people and had the issue somewhat resolved. After being so unempressed and frustrated with the account I decided to close it, and open one with my personal bank that I had just opened a new account with (I felt my money was safer there). I then withdrew the money from the card, and decided to close out my old account which had to remain open for a short while so all transactions could clear. I called the number on the back of the card AGAIN....waited on hold AGAIN....and spoke to several people AGAIN. Finally the last guy I spoke with assured me he would close my account including the $50 per month from my bank account (I had also informed him I would be closing that account as well). After I thought all was said and done, i get a bank statement from my old account stating I was overdrawn by $107. This was a result of H&R Block continuing to withdraw $50 a month as well as overdraft fees of $28. I called the bank and H&R Block. I finally got ahold of someone in finance. They requested bank statements which I faxed the following day. I heard NOTHING from them for over a week. I finally called and AGAIN spoke to several people (at this point I was so upset I started recording my calls). The woman I talked to gave me a case number since the guy that told me he would cancel the account DIDN'T, and gave me a correct number to follow up with since everyone else in the company gave me the number to another company that had no relation to H&R Block. Weeks went by again, and I heard nothing. I called back, and of course talked to someone else since the same person was never available, and was told twice that the check for the amount I was owed was at the bank and processing (one guy even had the nerve to tell me I was making good time!). Another week, same old routine, different person, only this time I asked to speak to a manager. Of course I was not transfered to one. The girl told me that everything had been processed and approved, but nothing was being done. I asked again to speak to a manager, so she gave me the mystery number that had no relation to H&R Block. I called back, and of course, got a different person. I then gave her the name of the girl I had just spoken with and asked to speak with her or someone higher. She told me the girl I had JUST talked to was on break, and all managers were in a meeting, and then she hung up on me! I then called the company that I filed my taxes with (again) and she tried to get in contact with the right person. They even gave her 2 wrong numbers, but at least one of them gave me a different number I could use. I called that number and talked to another guy that promised me I would hear from someone within 24 to 48 hours (he also promised documentation to provide to my credit company incase this matter went negative against my credit). Three days later I recived a check in the mail for only $28 which was only one overdraft fee, and of course no documentation (hardly worth all the mess I have been through). I have not given up, but I will go a different route from now on. Even though $107 doesn't seem like much, it is when it has been this much trouble just for someone to give you back the money they owe you! Overdrawn bank account, negative report against my credit, phone overage, stress, agravation, dissapointment, negative outlook on a company that myself, friends, family, and coworkers have been using for years.
My mother purchased an Express IRA through her local H&R Block Tax Preparation center. After her death, the family contacted H&R Block to disburse the monies. With no beneficiary form on file, the account could not be closed. Because all of her other accounts and retirement funds administered by other companies had proper documentation, we believe that H&R Block, through their own negligence, lost or never ensured that she completed a beneficiary form. The local H&R Block Tax Preparation center was unable to help us (they serve only to prepare taxes and sell, but not manage retirement funds) and we then began dealing with Customer Service representatives in an unknown location. Subsequently we filed a Declaration for Collection of Property Without Probate form (California Probate Code section 13100). We made several phone calls and were instructed by the H&R Block Financial Advisors location in Florida to complete W-9 forms and H&R Block Express IRA Distribution forms for both beneficiaries. At that time we resent the California Probate 13100 form. We also included a letter detailing our request to equally disburse the monies and this request was also clearly indicated on the IRA Distribution forms. We have just received a check made payable to our mother's estate. As we had filed the California Probate form, we were not required to open an estate account or request an estate EIN from the IRS. We now have a check which we cannot deposit unless we open an estate account at a local bank. H&R Block refuses to honor the California Probate 13100 form even after collecting the proper IRS forms and their own internal documents which would allow the funds to be disbursed to beneficiaries and not an estate. H&R Block has provided completely dissatisfactory service and appears to be unable to properly manage customer accounts or adequately communicate between these two aspects of their company Tax Preparation and Financial Advising. Lessons Learned: Don't Use H&R Block and always make sure you have a will, trust and/or properly executed beneficiary forms! It has taken 20 months to have a check issued. During that time, the value of my mom's IRA lost about $800.00. We may incur additional costs as we have to request an IRS EIN, open an estate account and then close it.
I have been a customer for many years and today i have learned that i can no longer trust hrblock to handle my taxes or any of my personal information. As i do each year i filed my taxes online and then complete them at an hrblock office. I filed in March got my refund had no issues until today 5/12/2008. I got a phone call at my job from another HR block customer explaining how HR Block give her all of my personal information including my tax return. She called the office to let them know and they asked for my information back, she refused to return the information if fear they would give it to someone else. The lady was nice enough to contact me (by finding my phone number on my return) she wanted to meet with me and go over what happen as well as give me my personal information. As hrblock lost her return. I don't understand why there was another copy of my return just sitting on someone's desk since i filed in March. Not only that but my entire identity is at risk. Im really worried about what i should do and who i should contact. All i can say at this point is that i am a very unhappy customer. Possible identify theift, having to change all my information, calling credit bureau's
I have filed my taxes with this company for the last 3-4 years and my service was good until this year. I have before done rapid refund but didn't want to do it this year as it was pointed out to me by my girlfriend that I could save some money by just having my refund direct deposited. I told Michelle that I wanted direct deposit she in turn told me that I would be charged a fifty dollar fee by the bank if I did that. She then in turn talked me into getting my check thru them and I would receive that check in 10 days. Well my girlfriend was looking over my tax forms and informed me that I was being charged about fifty dollars for them to receive my check. She also told me she did her taxes on line and wasn't charged a fee for direct deposit. I did call them at H&R block about this but I didn't receive a very good response. I believe that this woman scammed me into thinking they were saving me money and I believed her when she told me my bank would charge me a fee. I will never again use H&R block I will do my taxes online. I really would like to bring this to someones attention that people are being ripped off or scammed by this large company. I just can't imagine how they can sleep at night knowing that they are taking advantage of people like that. I don't consider myself stupid but what about the people who are literacy impaired. I fell for it. I would like to let the president of this company know how this place are being ran in our small town. I probably wouldn't have complained but I was also told by this same woman that I would be receiving my stimulus payment today May 9th but because I received my payment thru them I will not get my payment until June 27th. I don't make alot of money and I have 2 children so any extra cash I have helps us out. I directly told this woman Michelle that I did not want rapid refund, I just wanted them to do my taxes and do direct deposit. So as a result of this I will no longer use their services. I spent money that I could have used for my family and I was lied to. Maybe to them 50 - 100 dollars is just chump change but not to me. Thank you.
I contact my local H&R Block office to file my taxes. I call ahead to make sure it won't be too expensive. The woman I speak with informs me that the costs depend on how sophisticated and involved my return is. I explain that I have two W-2s from my two jobs in 2007, and she tells me that my fee will be $80. Great. I arrive on time for my scheduled meeting. After an hour, my presence is acknowledged and the same woman I spoke with earlier on the phone finally sits down to help me. She has no idea what she's doing. She is fumbling through screens, getting error messages, yelling across the room to her more seasoned co-worker to ask questions, unable to answer any of my rudimentary questions about my return, and generally gives me the impression that this is her first day on the job and that I should feel zero confidence that my return is being filed correctly. After an hour of this, I finally get the number I owe to the government...and to H&R Block. That will be $355, she says. She must be kidding me. I remind her that I called earlier that day and of the price she quoted me. She feels badly, so calls someone, who agrees to let her give me $45 off of my $355 total. I tell her what I think of her service and her attempt to atone for it. I leave scathing mad. I call the 1-800 number to file a complaint. They tell me someone will contact me. No one does. I got people? That's true, I do - they're incompetent, manipulative, and the shadiest business I've ever had the displeasure of patronizing.
I used H&R Block for the convienience because they had a kiosk set up on the military base on which I live and I couldn't get ahold of my usual tax-preparer. The agent set my bank account routing number from a drop down window, and I said that we should check it because my account was with a subsidiary of the bank in question. I retuned with my checkbook and gave him the CORRECT routing number and was assured that my 1040 would be updated before it was sent out. My tax rebate and 2007 incentive package never arrived because the routing number for my bank account was wrong. Instead the IRS is sending a check and I can't afford the airline tickets that I desperately needed for my wife and I to come home! They offered me no refund for preparation fees and refused any attempt at rectifying THEIR mistake. With H&R Block you DON'T have people!
i took my tax materials to company, h&r block. they did not inform me of their rates. i also did not ask. the accountant tax advisor did my taxes. when finished she presented me with a bill for $694. i was shocked but thought i must be obligated to pay. i had no idea taxes could be so much to have done - it was my first time. i did have an estate due to a trust my father left me that i have no access to funds from yet. i understand that taxes with estate trusts are complicated to prepare. However, i later found out private accountant can do them for as little as $300! i had no refund on my taxes, although i had almost no income (below the minimum for being taxed and even having to file !) i could not receive the tax rebate offered for 2007 by the IRS, according to my accountant there. i had to pay this high fee on top of having almost no income. it was quite difficult for me. needless to say, i am in debt now as i had to put it on my credit card with other debt. is there anything i can do? are there any fee guidelines or can anyone charge anything without informing in advance of performing services?
I filed my taxes in 2001-2004 with H&R Block. I purchased the peace of mind assurance plan each year. I was audited in December 2006 for 2004 taxes and IRS found several errors clearly made by HRBlock. I immediately contacted HRBlock. I was rerouted so many times and promised so many calls back it is indescribable. Finally, after intense pounding, I was asked to go to a Florida office and file the peace of mind claim. Thye found the errors and stated it is a result of our computer glitch. They were unable to even ammend the taxes for that year because the computer would keep doing the same errors. The agent filed the claim once, denied. Twice, denied. Three times, case closed. I have now spent over 140 hours of my time. I had to pay the taxes, interest and penalties owed, and I still remain without an amended return for the federal and my state returns. while she was auditing, she found further errors the IRS did not find. I demanded my peace of mind claim cover all costs as contract clearly states and promises it will do. To no avail..I got a check after a total of 16 months of my efforts (they guarantee 4-6 weeks to pay the claim). It was for the interest only. I never received the taxes owed or any of the other monies owed due to their mistakes. I put in 11 complaints in 16 months. I put a demand for payment. I wrote the Attorney General and the BBB about them. I called their legal department. The lady who said would help me no longer works there. End of story is: Today on day 526 I believe, I was told by HRBlock administration that your case is closed. It is black and white here. Even though it was reopened last week, it was closed one minute later. I suggest you take the legal route and you might get paid. So, tomorrow I will file a lawsuit obviously, since this is the thirs time an employee has said that it is sad, but it is the only way I will get the claim paid. This is unconsionable in my opinion. I have had a threat of a lien on my bank accounts and life in general for 15 months now. My husband had his tax refund witheld for 2007 because we married in 2007. He had nothing to do with 2004 or their mistakes. I will now owe more money for other mistakes their own agents found. I will now have to pay a new accountant to do all the years taxes they did to ammend properly. The amount of damage is not known, only can estimate the taxes owed alone will exceed $2000 plus penalties, interest and attorney fees, accountant fees etc. This and all my hundreds of hours of time and over a hundred pages of notes regarding this claim. The stress is not measurable.
i invested $1000.00 in 2006 but havent received a statement. i called the local branch of HR Block and was given a phone number that was incorrect. called back and was tolk they didnt have any information on the IRA Company. i went looking online for contact information and found this article. Please provide me any additional information you might have, greatly concerned that i may have gotten taken advantage of.
Filed 2007 taxes. April 1, 2007, With H & R Block, have used them once before in the year 2005. This time my spouse was out of state in NC. I informed the prepairer I would be going to visit on the 2th of April. My return from the Federal tax return was $317.00. State return $40.00.. My expectation would be a higher return, which didn't happen and excepted that. Then the prepairer inform me they needed $319.00 cash or check for their services. I explained this would not be possible due to non-employment and receiving no benifits. The prepairer told me my return didn't qualify for an electronic filing because not enough funds were being returned. I received the forms to carry with me to NC, and have signed by my spouse and mailed back to the office. They were informed I would be out of state past the 15th filing date. The 15th, of April I received a phone call from the firm, stating my tax returns would not be filed until the payment was made. Time being around 4:30 pm. A call could have been made before the last day, the forms were in their pocession. After being informed they are putting me in contact with the branch supervisor now regarding this. I believe my conversation and the explanation, was being given to the branch manager. Being told I would not be obligated to pay, if I choose to pick up my W-2's and filed after I returned. This I accepted to do. Later the same night I recieve a call from the branch again telling me, sorry the manager never got with me because she was busy. And the prepairer told me, you must file by midnight today, or your not eligable for the economic stimulus payment. After a lenghty conversation she stated my filing fees could be reduced by $30.00 so that electronic filing could be excepted. The neccessary paperwork would needed to be signed, again express being in NC and unable to get into the office, and the wife would still be remaining in NC when I do return. Obtaining full power of attorney for my wifes behalf, the papers were signed upon my return. When receiving the paperwork, I asked when I could expect a check from the state portion of the return. Being informed by her at that time. You will not get a check, it is being assigned to our H & R Block green card. Useable at any ATM's however there will be a fee for whichever ATM you use. Inquiring about the time a check for the economic stimulus would arrive, I was told. It will not be mailed instead, it has to go on their green card because of the filing practice. Serveral questions now arise due to hearing several law suits against the company. Also another look back into my previous filings with the firm. Personnaly feel as though force into expenses and fees outside of my control, due to the firms practices. Also a major deception, told to clients about requirements, to receive the economic stimulus check. I believe fees should have been explained up front and prior to starting any paperwork. I'm also concerned now about any privacy information releases.
First off, the tax professionals are NOT professionals at all, rather, they are temps. When I came to their office in the beginning of April, I had already had my taxes fully prepared. I asked them to do an efile for me so that I could receive my refund quicker. I had my 2006 taxes as well as my 2007 taxes with me at the time. Both of which needed done. When we were there I specifically had told them that I knew I had back taxes owed that would need to be deducted from my returns I was filing. My question to them was if I paid the extra money to have them prepared with the quick efile, quick return process if this would hold up anything. Of course she assured me that would not happen, they would still be in the 8-15 day category. I agreed to pay the additional fee and have them take the money I owed out of the refund. Now it becomes bad. After 4 weeks and several hours on the phone, the IRS informed me that because of the amount owed my refund was delayed and would need an additional 2 weeks to process. Furthermore, my direct deposit refund would now be considered a paper refund when it came to the stimulus checks that were going out. When the money owed to H&R Block is taken out, they put their own bank account number on the refund, not mine. So instead of receiving my stimulus check as direct deposit, on April 29th as it should, I won't receive it until June 9th. Warning to all people, H&R Block tax professionals are no more than temporary employees who take a quick course on tax preparation. They are a fraud and will be holding many of us up due to their lack of knowledge. My 8-15 refund is now a 6 week affair, and my stimulus check will be delayed by almost 2 months due to them.
HR BLOCK due to their lax policies and procedures (not verifying personal data, drivers licenses,place of residence,telephone #'s, W-2 Forms,deductions declared or keeping copies of such )have made it easy for ID THEFT and HAVE EXACERBATED THE CRIMES OF FORGERY, FRAUD and MISAPPROPRIATION OF MY ID.
My wife and I filed our tax returns with H & R block March of 2008 and they sent the money to the wrong checking account on April 4th 2008. The routing number and account number arent close by even one digit. Furthermore, they sent the money to a U.S. Bank account and we bank at Wells Fargo. My wife and I have to file IRS paperwork to try and get our tax returns ($8,500). Everyone I speak to including the District Manager doesn't have an answer. The IRS person we spoke to said it sounds like the H & R Block computer defaulted and put in a different routing and account number. We have paid H & R Block $269.00 and they didn't have a problem getting that money from our savings account, but can't help us any further. My tax money is sitting in someone else checking account. We have paid $269.00 to have our taxes completed. Economic damages consist of lost interest, time, cell phone minutes, and home repairs to make the house more economical. We may have to cancel a trip this summer if we don't get our money; however, we have already purchased our plane tickets. Physical damage resulted in anxiety and stress attracts. We have four children and two foster children that needed items purchased from the tax return. Please HELP!
They did our taxes & because we had a 1099,they charged us $485.00 to do them .I felt that this was too much,so I called the I.R.S.& was informed that they did charge too much.What am I suppose to do?We really needed that money.I have heard that they have overcharged a lot of people.They need to be made to refund part of their fees. Because of the huge fee,we were not able to pay the billswe had planned to pay.I just wish someone could help.
I purchased the Basic software in January 2008 to file my taxes. I did my income tax and IRS aprroved on Feb 13, 2008 for the amount of 811.00 I was supposed to receive the amount of 781.01 because HR offers a simple pay deposit, this means, you don't pay out of your pocket until you received your income tax and they deduct the 29.99 from your refund. I receive a wire transfer on 2/21 for the amount of 491.05 sinceday it has become a nightmare I reported my case on 3/02 at 7:30 am and the CSR accepted that HR BLOCK sold a defective product with wrong routing numbers. They assigned me case number 1171524. I had made 20 phone calls with a wait from 12-50 minutes and they transfer me from dept to dept and nothing gets done. I am concerned now because my rebate is going to get into HR PHONY account. I've already mailed out a letter to IRS to the fraud department and noting has been done. HR acknowledges they sold a bad product and even with the online updates the routing numbers and accounts were fake. Also why did they wire me some money a day before the irs deposited their money into their accounts?
On April 15, 2008, H & R Block offered Taxcut for $45 (downloadable software for fed and state with eFile extra), or $60 (online for fed and state with eFile included). After taking the whole interview, it asked for the $60 and for the first time informed me that eFile might not be available, but would not tell me before paying whether eFile was available. I had no other option that I could do in time, so I paid. Then, when I submitted the eFile, I received an email (which I saved) informing me that my fed and state returns had been transmitted. The online product would allow me to print only copies that read Do Not File, and instructed me explicitly NOT to mail my return. But on April 16, 2008, I received notification that my fed return was accepted, but that H & R Block had a problem with and did not forward my state return in the first place. H & R Block's customer service was down, maybe due to volume, so I could not get an explanation why my state return was not forwarded after I was told it already had been. All I could glean was that now I should mail my state return, which I did. Since H & R Block's decided not to file my state return of their own doing, they obviously could have identified that they were going to do that before charging me for a service they knew they could not provide and making me jump through hoops to be a day late. Now I have to wait 5-7 weeks for a refund I should have gotten in 8 days, and I am out the $15 I paid for the online option with free filing (but which costs $15 more than the software without free filing). Obviously I would not have purchased this product over the cheaper other product which would have put me in a better position faster. I also have the stigma of filing after the deadline, and being a prosecutor, I don't like breaking the law like that (even though it was beyond my control and to the state's benefit given that it is a refund). The damage to me alone is not huge, of course, but the extra $15 H & R Block makes on all the people who fall for their bait and switch, and the interest all of us suckers lose on all that refund money that will take longer to get, is a large damage to society that H & R Block should bear. I'm a lawyer, but not a class action lawyer, so whether there's meat for a claim there is not my specialty. There sure is bad will, though, and I'd love to hit H & R Block even if only with enough bad will to cost them what they cost me!
I too used the Emerald Card $500 advance in February 2008. I began receiving bills in the mail stating I owed the bank over $400. I put them aside as I believe that this was just to let me know what would be taken from my return. I pulled my annual credit report this past week and behold, there was a 30 days past due for the Emerald Card statement on my credit. I immediately contacted the Emerald Card company and was greeted with the nastiest customer support operator in the world. I informed her that this issue would most definitely be filed with our State Attorney General's office. She stated, If you had READ your agreement, you would have seen that the IRS is the one responsible for making sure your payment was sent in on time. If you want to turn someone in, turn in the IRS to the general or whatever you called him. I asked her what her name was and she stated, what you didn't get it the first time, and hung up on me. I contacted the H&R Block office where I did business (for over 10 years on and off). They are suppose to contact me in 30 minutes with some information about the problem. I also went online to check my account (Emerald Card), which naturally had a 0 balance. I printed off the statement and added all the monies transacted on the account and found that they were missing account transactions which did not total to the $500.00 initially placed on the card. I don't know what's going on, but if it had not been for my annual credit report draw, I would have never known and would have been racking up late fees on my credit with 30, 60, 90 day past due account amounts on my credit. So, I suggest anyone that has gotten the Emerald Card IMMEDIATELY check your credit report, I can almost bet you will find that you have been reported to the credit bureau by this unscrupulous company. My credit (which is not the best in the world) has a stain that I feel is not a fair stain as I would have NEVER taken this card if I had known that this was going to happen. H&R Block has just lost a long-time customer. I have called all my friends that I have referred to H&R Block to have them check their credit and/or their account balances with the Emerald Card. This is shameful and someone should be prosecuted for this.
I went to an atm machine to get funds, there was no funds available. I had a little over $300.00 dollars in the account. I called customer service and got the run around as to I must have used all the funds. When it was figured out I had not used the funds I was told I called and had a new card issued, which I never did. I called all the numbers I was given to clear up the problem up and the supervisor would give me a call. Never received the call. So I call back and get someone who tell me I have to dispute the withdrawls and send a fax to those facts. That I did, I had to call back because I never got and feed back as to when I would get my funds. Called again got a customer service rep told me they received my fax and now I had to get an affidvit from H&R and have it notized get a police report and sent that in. That was a week and a half ago and I have not received the affidvit for H&R bank. This started March 26, 2008 today is April 15th. If it that easy for someone to have my addressed changed and divert my stuff to another address think about all that money coming in from the government from the government rebate. However you received you income tax refund that's how you will receive you stimulas package. Some of mine got into the wrong hands via that emerald card. I do not want my rebate to go that way. I saved that for my daughters promotion trip to Washington DC this May. A working mother has no extra money to lose especally to a bank. They charge me enought for not having enought money to keep from paying high fees.
Did you receive a mail from H&R Block that promise you a FREE filing but at the end are asked to pay $14.95? So did I.This is how I got around: call:1-888-482-9288 and explain the situation.You will be asked a few things like how much your gross income was for 2007.If you qualified before(2006),you will qualify again and will get a KEY CODE. Go to the filing page where is asked how to pay the $14.95 and choose KEY CODE(bottom one),then click NEXT. Fill in the KEY CODE and click NEXT.Now you'll see the $14.95 is deducted and the filing is FREE. GOOD LUCK.
2003 I had a restraining order on my husband- I was told that I had to file taxes with him because he took his pension out. I did not want to get in trouble so I went down and talked with Loren Smith the H&R block tech. He assured me three times that the money my husband took out was a rollover into the house. I signed and now I am paying off 15 thousand dollars! I trusted them to help me not hurt me. Loren was fired because he was messing up everybodies taxes~! Financial hardship and stress. I can not pay my other bills because I have to pay 230 dollars a month to IRS.
I have used this company for several years for filing my taxes. I married in 2006 and filed my taxes as usual. My husband is on SSDI and has been for several years. It states on the tax form that he is disabled. The problem is that even though the tax preparer knew that my husband is disabled, she didn't bother to ask if he collects SSDI. We got a refund but later we received a letter from the IRS stating that we owe back the return plus penalties and interest. She should have asked if my husband collects SSDI so we could claim it in our taxes. Is H & R Block liable for this situation? I just got laid off after 30 plus years in the Escrow business and my husband is disabled and does not work.
H&R Block Bait and Switch: I went to H&R Block to have my federal and state returns completed. At the initial interview, I asked how much it would cost and was told it would be about $200 due to the complexity of the forms. I agreed to this cost and gave the preparer my information. The preparer was apparently not qualified to handle one of my state returns, and told me that my return would be completed by someone else; so she would contact me when they were complete. After two weeks, I had yet to hear from H&R Block, so I called. I found that nothing had been done with my return. My preparer claimed it was because additional information was needed, and requested I come back in. I did, more because I thought the only way they would finish would be for me to watch them do it. I did not provide any additional information, and the federal return was completed at that time, although the state returns still had to be prepared by someone else. At the end of this session, I was asked to pay $337, an increase of 70% of the price I was quoted. I was told the increase was due to having state returns and owing a balance on my federal return. Since they had all my forms, I paid; but within an hour, feeling that the difference between quoted and actual price was too much, I called back to cancel. I was told it was too late because they had filed the federal return already. Separately, they have signs around the store saying that they will give you a $25 check if they do not tell you about their refer-a-friend program during the initial tax preparation visit. My tax preparer did not, so I asked about this. She told me you had to ask when you paid, in contradiction to the advertisement. At my last visit, no one had told me about the send a friend visit still, so I inquired again. She again tried to say I had to ask when I paid. But I pointed out the clear language on the ad, and she agreed that I had followed what their advertisement required. I asked if there was any form to fill out, and they said I had to call the district office. I spoke to Peter, who had claimed to be the manager in a previous conversation, and I asked for a statement saying I had followed the terms of the ad, but they refused to provide it to me. When I called the district office, they told me I had to speak to the manager of the H&R Block to get the reward. I don't think they ever intend to honor their posted advertisements. If I had known the price would be $337, and not 200, I would not have used their services. They have promised me to send a $30 refund check to make up part of the difference, but I have not received the check.
My wife files her taxes with H&R Block, and they talked her in to putting me on her taxes under injured spouse. We had told them I owed back child support and was insured without fail--that no way could they take any of it. Well, they took every penny--even hers. I would sure like to know what happened to their employees that they talk soooo highly of. H&R Block is blaming IRS on this matter and don't want to back up their promise if anything happens to your money, that they will pay for it. This is simply false advertisement. We may lose our car because of the planning we did to pay other bills.
I've done some research into two of the common complaints about TaxCut after I had a problem with my software. First of all, Simple Pay is just that. It's simple. It's not the fastest option or the cheapest option offered by TaxCut. It is the simplest, though, if you do not have money to pay for the processing of the return at the time you file it. The fastest and cheapest way to get your refund is to pay up front for all of the tax prep fees and then efile. Simple Pay works like this: you file your return, and it goes to the IRS. If they accept it, then the IRS sends the money to H&R Block. When your return is accepted by the IRS, they usually disperse those funds on the following Friday from that date. So, if your return was accepted on a Wednesday, it would be about a week and a half before the IRS sends out that money. Then, it gets to H&R Block. They take out the amount owed and within 1-3 business days, they will deposit into the account listed on your return. If the account is not valid, then a check is sent to you within approximately 15 days or so to the address listed on your return. If that doesn't work, then special consideration is taken to make sure everyone gets their money, but this only happens on the rarest user errors. In the terms and conditions, which can all be read in full length on www.taxcut.com (and which you had to agree to in order to use Simple Pay), it does state that there is no guarantee of a timeframe for when your money will be deposited, but H&R Block works as quickly as they can to get everyone a refund or else they'd get sued like crazy if they kept everyone's money forever. It's always wise to read through what you're agreeing to first. H&R Block is using a different system this year which is taking longer to deposit the money as opposed to previous years. Hopefully in the future it will be faster. As far as efiles are concerned, there is no guarantee that you can efile. The IRS and states have restrictions on certain forms and quantities of forms that can be efiled. Also, if your return is rejected, you may be ineligible by the government to efile again. Unfortunately, there's nothing TaxCut can do to change this. The online products do not include efile in the price; it is included for free. That is why the online products are cheaper than the software that includes efiling. If your software says +efile on it, then you paid for it; otherwise, you did not. If you paid for a software includes it and you are unable to efile, then it may be possible to get compensation from TaxCut for that portion (I did) if the IRS has no record of a successful efile from you. If you are able to successfully paper file the return, then H&R Block considers the product to be working and will not issue a refund of the price of the product. I absolutely understand the concerns of people with TaxCut. However, there is usually a simple reason for these concerns. TaxCut works with the IRS, but the IRS ultimately sets the rules. Also, please be a smart consumer and read through terms and conditions before accepting! Yes, it's long, but unfortunately, you can't change the rules after you've agreed to them. This information is exactly what they gave me, so I'm not giving out anything special. I hope this helps!
Lisa Brooks was supposed to do my taxes for me. I gave her all my paperwork then she promptly disappeared from the office. She didn't call me back for several weeks. When she did call back she did them in a couple minutes. She was supposed to mail me back my copies and she never did. Then someone from the office called me and said that she hadn't done them correctly. Also she had never filed my local tax. This is after she told me they were all done. In addition she had me paying local taxes to Philadelphia when I never lived there or worked there. On top of that she tried to jack me for more money then we had agreed on. She said she was doing mine under friends and family. Luckily someone else in the office took over and straightened out everything she had messed up. But consequently she has my copies and I doubt I will ever get them from her. She called me and started demanding that I pay her (I had already paid H&R Block). She called me several times and harassed me over the phone.
I went to H&R Block last week to have my taxes done. After seeing the options for getting my return back, I opted for the Emerald MasterCard route. I received my return back on the card a couple days later. Ok, no problem. But wait! After two days and paying some bills, I should have had (according to my ledger) $179.00 left on the card. I went to buy about $40 worth of groceries, and the card was declined. I called the 866 number on the back of the card, and the computer told me that I had a balance of $5.00! I then called Block to find out what the problem was but was told by them that HSBC was responsible for the card, and despite the fact that the card clearly says H&R Block on the front, they have no say-so in how the monies on the card are dealt with. Then I called the 866 number back, but it wouldn't recognize my number. I tried twice to no avail, then waited for customer service. After 20 minutes on hold I finally hear somebody pick up and then this cackling laughter in the background: the rep making jokes with his peers. Once he realizes someone is on the line, he hangs up. Another call, and another 20 minutes got me a woman in India, I guess, whose English was sub-standard at best, who couldn't enlighten me in any way about the lost money, why the computer wasn't recognizing my card# or even apologize for the earlier treatment. She gave me a URL to check the list of transactions made by the card, but getting there I found I needed an ID# and password, which she didn't mention even though I asked if such was required. It led me to another page which asked for my card# and its password. I entered these, got a network error message and was dismissed. So where is my missing money? Has this happened to anyone else? This is outrageous. Since I came up short on the card, I missed my phone bill and will have to wait until next Friday to pay it. Hopefully I won't lose it in the meanwhile. I'm riding my bike to work now as some of that would've been used for gas and have become a little more disenchanted with the financial institutions and the system at large. I feel like I've been robbed. But the way the system works, taking them to court would cost me more than the $179 that I lost. As usual, the law favors the rich and disregards all others, or so it seems.
LENGTH OF TIME CLIENT HAS USED H&R BLOCK: 7 yrs. CHRONOLOGICAL STATEMENT OF FACTS: January 22, 2007: OVERCHARGED FEES and was resolved. The H&R Block field office located at 2491-G Okeechobee Blvd. West Palm Beach, Florida, double charged (debited) fees from my checking account in the amount of $116 each or $232. They cut check # and electronically. Check was retained by H&R block and not returned to the client, me. It is noted that the Office Manager was swiping customer checks several times in the check reader. On January 26, 2008, my taxes were completed and fees were incurred in the amount of $133 with the H&R Block district office. H&R Block accepted the check, stamped it void and returned the check to me. February 1, 2008 H&R BLOCK MISHANDLED FEES. A clerical error occurred, and the H&R Block fee payment in the amount of $133 was not received electronically. Another check was issued in the same amount to the H&R Block district office. During this process, a female named April stated that the H&R Block check had to remain at H&R Block for depositing. I refused to leave this second issued check with H&R Block due to the incident the prior year. The check was swiped through the check reader with the cash register drawer opening confirming payment had been received. March 3, 2008 & March 12, 2008: UNRESOLVED. I received a call while at work from the H&R Block district office, a District Operations Specialist (DOS) stated that H&R Block had not received payment due to my not leaving the check with H&R Block for depositing with TeleCheck--a leading provider of paper and electronic check services. With over 40 years of experience, TeleChecks commitment to continuous innovation helps business safely and efficiently accept check payments at the point-of-sale. TeleCheck helps more than 350,000 retail, financial institutions, grocery and other industry outlets increase profitability, reduce risk and streamline operations. The DOS inquired how I was going to make the payment: CASH, credit, or a THIRD CHECK. Thoroughly disgusted with the District Manager (DM), on escalation I contacted H&R Block Client Relations Arizona, who researched and verified the electronic payment was made on 2/1/08 with time, check #, and cashier, and that the District Office needed to contact the Bookkeeping Department for H&R Block. All H&R Block needs to do is stop requesting client reissued checks, stop double debiting checking accounts, stop harassing repeat clients, stop retaining client checks when electronic payment has already been made, and simply debit the amount electronically, as done in a good faith effort on the date of purchase. They need to fix their validaters/readers, too. All of this defeats their purpose of having a partnership with TeleCheck. I'm a responsible and educated consumer, and I won't write checks if I don't have the funds. After seven years, I'm switching to a different tax firm. Frustration, harassment and poor customer service. I had to file an official complaint with the Better Business Bureau.
I went into the Calumet City office to file my taxes on 2-4-08. I went through the procedure of having my taxes done, but when the lady got to the fees I declined all offers. I then collected all my information (w2's), and I left the facility. I got my taxes done by a private tax person, and that was done on 2-8-08. What H&R Block quoted me I didn't get back; but what my private tax person quoted me I received. On March 8, 2008 at 8:00 a.m., I received a call from a representative from (HSBC) through H&R Block. The representative stated that I had an outstanding balance of $803.00 from them, and I began to panic and become very nervous. I knew that I didnt create this bill; and I immediately told him that I didnt even file my taxes with H&R Block. I told him that I started to and went into the office, but I declined all offers. He immediately gave me a number to the fraud deparment who I called immediately. I then called my local police department who sent over a policemen, and he appointed me to go to the H&R Block to talk to someone there and see what they had to say. When the facility opened up I went up there at 10:00 a.m. and spoke to Denise who asked me what the problem was; and then once she found out she appointed me to Tonya who asked for my name and ss#. I gave it to her while I was sitting down. She then went to the back of the place to look for my paperwork; and she came back looking furious because she couldnt find my paperwork at all. She then looked for my DCN number, and she couldnt find that either. She came back looking furious about this situation, also. Tonya finally called her manager (Albeta Pritchet) who was astound by the conversation that she was having with Tonya; she told her what had happened, and Alberta couldnt believe it. Alberta asked for my information and stated that she was going to contact me on Monday March 10, 2008, in the morning, once she began her investigation. Alberta also said maybe the tax preparation lady hit the transmit button by mistake. I told her yeah right, because the lady went back to the orignial screen. She also stated that maybe the person never used the E card that they generated from this H&R Block. I knew that was a lie also because I knew no one would have gone that far and not used the card. I went home, and I did my own investigation. I got the number for the E Card, and I contacted them myself. I called several numbers until I finally got in contact with someone at this E card place. The lady took my information, and she asked me if I had the card number. I told her no because I am the victim and someone stole my identity. She asked for my information, and she told me that the card was used and where the card was used at. I then called back up to H&R block and spoke with Tonya, and I told Tonya to let Alberta know that the card was used, and I had the address of where this person went. I had to call the credit bureaus and get a fraud alert on my credit. On Monday morning Alberta didnt call me back; I had to call her, and I was very upset. I then talked to a Ralph from the Orland Park location. He asked me what had happened and couldnt grasp this situation. Finally he caught on and told me that whatever fee I had to pay, that H&R Block was going to reimburse me. Later on that night I went to the police department to get a police report ,and they stated that they couldnt give me one because I needed some documents to prove that I was a victim of fraud. When I left the police station I immediately went to H& RBlock, and again I spoke with Denise. I asked her over and over for my paperwork and how could someone get a loan without a signature? She told me that the signature was on file. I told her that anyone could come in and get a loan without a signature. I told her that this was so because someone should have something to prove that someone forged my name and stole my identity. I left there because I was getting upset. Wveryone at this H&R Block is a suspect to me, and I felt that they were all suspicious. I called Ralph, and I left him a message telling him to contact me in the morning, Tuesday. I then talked to Alberta and explained to her that I couldnt get a police report, and she and I suggested that I come up to the H&RBlock and call the police from here. I did called the police, and I finally received my Police report. I had to go through hell and hot water to get this. I think that everyone at H&R Block owes me an apology, and I think that I should be compensated for my pain and suffering I had to go through. The staff at H& R Block was acting so suspiciously. Please contact me asap.
H&R Block - what can I say? I too went down there and got my taxes filed there. What a mistake that was. First of all, they figured my city tax wrong. Well, its a good thing I did my taxes before the dead line date to file. When I called to tell H&R Block of their mistake, the lady said they were running off an old system. Needless to say, it got me thinking about the State and IRS tax forms. I called them again, and went in and sat down with them; and they looked through everything again and assured me that everything else is correct. In my way of thinking they should have given me a refund on the city tax form part, seeing they erred, but guess I think wrong or something because they did not give me the money back. Later I called the 1800 number to complain to them about my local office, and got a letter back from the local office in concerns of my complaint to the 1800 number. I ended up going in there again, with the same questions I had before for my 2005 tax return. Receipts that were used to deduct on what I owed the IRS--some were used and some were not. And my figures and theirs were way off. That year I had to pay a lot, more than I did any other year. So what gives, I thought? It is the receipts since some they used and some they did not. When asked about this, the owner of this H&R Block branch said she assumed that some were personal and not for business. My response was simple and to the point: So you think I drove up to the tank and bought 300 gallons worth of fuel of diesel for a company truck in a different state--that this was a personal adventure? Give me a break. Towards the end I got up, and said this and many other reasons are why I have not been back since. How can anybody think H&R Block can do other peoples taxes when they have failed to do their own right when they filed with the IRS?
I have been an H&R Block customer for about 10 years and have never had a problem. In December I had surgery and I was off work for five weeks so I applied for H&R Block's Emerald Advance credit line that I received a mailing about. I was approved for the $500, and was told that the $500, plus interest, would be repaid from my tax refund. I was fine with that. I got a bill in the mail in January for the $511, which I took with me to my tax appointment on 02/03/08. H&R Block took the money out of my tax refund, plus I paid the $400 for having my taxes prepared by them, and I thought that was the end of it. I have been going there for about 10 years with no problems. Imagine my surprise when I got a bill in the mail on 03/03/08 for $14.93 still owed on my Emerald Advance credit line! I called the number on the bill but I was on hold for 48 minutes so I hung up. I tried two more times and finally I went to the office where I did my taxes. The tax prepared I spoke to told me they only sell the products but they really don't know anything about them. The next day the owner of the franchise office called me and told me that even though I paid my bill on time, the IRS delayed sending the money to H&R Block Bank so $1.12 in interest accrued and they tacked on a $13.81 finance charge. All in all, this is not a lot of money, but I did my part by paying my bill on time so I want to know what I am getting scammed for the extra $14.93! The franchise owner told me they are doing this to a lot of people, imagine all they money they are making! I will never again deal with H&R Block.
My husband and I have dealt with H & R Block for at least 10 yrs, and we have never had any real problems with them. The problem this year is with H & R Block bank, they are the ones that advance you the Emerald Advance line of credit. Pay close attention to your statements. We thought we paid our advance off with our tax refund, however the amount H&R Block deducted from our refund was just shy of the amount due. We not only still owe money, but we were hit with a finance charge for that money. Upon closer examination, my balance was raised by an advance to my card that the bank says never happened, I say it never happened, yet it raised my balance more than twenty dollars and increased my finance charge. If you call the bank to find out the problem, avoid an individual named Marvin. Marvin has jokes and likes to transfer you to various voicemails of individuals with no name. How professional for a bank. Although the extra money we have to pay isn't astronomical, my husband and I are forced to pay or risk damaging our credit report.. On a small scale the damage is between 5 to 50 dollars, on a larger scale if 1000 individuals that took out that line of credit go through the same experience we did, H&R bank is making a killing at the common taxpayer's expense.
I am active duty military and made the mistake of going to a tax preparer not near a military post. I came into the H&R Block Lacey, WA office in order to have my 2007 taxes filed. I was charged 50 dollars for federal and 70 for state. I noticed that my state return was very low when compared to the previous years and asked why this was so. The tax preparer stated that they were not sure and that it could be due to the fact that perhaps the state did not withhold as much as they did in the past. I went home and examined my taxes from the previous year and noticed that I was being taxed as a resident although I was stationed in another state. California state tax laws allow full refund of taxes paid if a service member is stationed out the state. I took my previous tax return and a copy of the tax law (printed out) to the office the very next day. Another tax preparer stated that they were unclear about military taxing and would get back to me in a few days. I instead took the documents to a H&R Block next to Fort Lewis (Preparers that knew what they were doing) and had them call the Lacey office and provide guidance. Upon returning to the Lacey office later that day I received the properly filed tax return and informed the preparer that I would like to speak to the manager. I received no call, so two days later I called the manager and asked for a refund of fees paid as per the H&R block policy. Maximum Refund Guarantee Get the maximum refund you're entitled to, or your tax preparation is free. This is clearly stated on the H&R block website. Instead of honoring the agreement, the manager instead made the statement that he did not understand why I needed a refund when his office corrected the error and got me a bigger refund than originally quoted. He went on to say that refunding my fees would come from the preparer's salary. I, in return, explained the above events and told him that if H&R Block honoring their refund agreement entailed another working person to lose part of their pay, then I'd rather not be refunded. With that I ended the call, but I still have a VERY bad taste in my mouth from the whole experience. If the tax preparer is not familiar with the tax laws then he/she should refer them to another office that is familiar. Furthermore they had no problem accepting payment even though they could have cost me my full entitlement. I as a consumer should not have to tell my tax preparer what is wrong with my return, and how to correct it. Nor should I have to go between two offices to have my paper work done correctly. If I wanted to do all that work then I would not have gone to a tax professional to have my taxes filed. Wasted time, wasted gas, and work that a paying customer should not have to do.
I filed my taxes online, using Tax Cut. I paid for the premium package which stated it Efiled both your federal and state returns. However, it wasn't until after my payment was processed that I received an email stating they could not Efile my state taxes. As I understand it, this is what they are offering as a service, not just the software to print out the pages, otherwise it would state so. After speaking with an HR Block Supervisor at the technical support center, I was told the Efiling was free with the purchase of the package and that it is not guaranteed. I believe this is fraud, or some sort of disillusionment or false advertisement. I only wanted a portion of what I paid for the filing returned (that belonging solely to the state portion for services not rendered) and James said he could not. After speaking with an online consultant about the specific problem concerning why my NY state return was rejected, which is also part of the package, she could not answer and just read what technical error message on her computer report, but could not offer any help and just said I would have to mail it in. This is not what I paid for. It will takes almost a month now to get the funds from my state return as opposed to the expeditious time efiling offers, and I'm also out the money I paid for such services.
The man who figured my taxes was very nice. HOWEVER, I was charged $240! How ridiculous! My adjusted gross income was below $20,000. I had one employer and one 1099 form. I think their charges are outrageous. I'm looking for another source next year. There were no consequences other than financial hardship. I owe $5,000 in back taxes from 10 years ago so both my state and federal refunds were kept by the IRS. I paid an excess of $2000 to them. I didn't get a dime back and I had to pay $240 to do it. Am I stupid or what?
I was supposed to get my refund check direct deposit. It came in the mail and I didn't know it was there all day because I work nights. Then I took the check to my bank to get it cashed and when the rep called to get it verified after 45 minute wait on the phone an H and R Block rep told her they don't verify checks at that number and gave her a number that was disconnected. She then returned the check and told me she couldn't do anything with it. I called back to the number on the stub of the check and was told that was false info and to return. The bank didn't want to deal with it again. I called to see if there was a bank in my area that I could cash the check at that contracted with H and R block and they told me Bank of America. Well, when I did a search, the closest one to me that told me they didn't cash those checks. I came home again after missing 16hrs. of work because I had no money for gas, I called and was told to take it to a Currency exchange. Well, when I got there it was going to be nearly $100.00 to cash it there and when the cashier went to verify, she also was told that they couldn't verify it until the morning. I came back home and called the same number and someone told me that she could verify it until 12am. Well, the currency didn't want to fool with it until the morning. So I missed work my morning and night job. I am a single mom with four children and this has been very inconvenient to me. I rode around all day with my fuel light on. I also missed 16 hours of work which will have my budget short in the long run.
I recently had my federal and state tax return processed at H&R Block. When I first went to have the taxes filed, I was claiming my daughter as a dependent, with the additional tax credit which was applied by the representative that filed my claim. After speaking with my wife, she informed me that she filed for the same tax credit, and I called H&R Block to correct the situation. The tax credit was not applied to my return. I thought that everything was all set, until I logged onto the IRS website to check my claim status, I was unable to check the status due to an error. Evidently, when H&R Block corrected the tax credit, they changed my filing status from Head of Household to Single without my knowledge. I was never advised this would be done, and wanted clarification. At 8:11 pm February 26 I called the local H&R Block office where my return had been processed and asked to speak to someone regarding the unapproved change in filing status. A woman got on the phone who would not answer why the status was changed, only repeatedly stated very rudely that she was with the company for twenty years, and that the status just changed. Because this woman was so demeaning, cruel and rude to my questions, I asked to speak to a manager, a supervisor at least if no manager was available. This woman refused. I then asked her what her name was, and she began again to say that she had been in the business with this company for twenty years. I expressed that my concern was not how long she worked there and that I would like to speak to a manager. The woman then disconnected the call. I have paid over $300.00 to this organization to have my tax return filed incorrectly without any explanation. As a consumer I am completely dissatisfied with the nasty treatment received by these people, and I am very upset that after paying for a service that is provided by professionals that I was treated very unprofessionally, and told that my tax status is not my concern. I will be moving forward to report this with the attorney general and better business bureau if no resolution occurs. This is an extreme disappointment that I am not given an explanation as to what has occurred with my taxes. My concerns also involve my personal well-being, for if there are any errors to these said documents, I may be penalized by the IRS; and I am avoiding any conflict that may occur at my expense because of the error of this company.
My wife and I have filed with HR Block for the past few years, and this year we decided we were going to itemize because we have a new house and numerous deductions. Last year, we paid $140 to file, and we did the express return option. So tonight we sat with the HR rep for less than an hour--maybe 45 minutes, really--and during that time we caught him making 4 different oversights/errors with our return. Our information was essentially the same: employers, automobiles, etc. So we run through the calculation, and he shows us our estimated return, which was fine. Then, as we are packing up our stuff, he shows us the fee. $330! Really? $330 for filing essentially the same return as last year? My wife and I already had everything itemized ourselves with the appropriate calculations, and when we saw the fee, we just scoffed. Fortunately, we told them to put the return on HOLD. The rep said his manager might be able to give us coupons, and we said, "Yeah, we'll get back to you" as we took all of our paperwork, right out the door. See you later, scam artists! Using a computer program poorly does not entitle you to $330 dollars of my hard-earned money. I will purchase Turbotax, and my wife and I will file ourselves. It might take a little longer, but we will save over $200 in the process.
I used their online service to Efile a New York State return. The return was denied because of a problem with wages earned in Yonkers as a non-resident. No matter what options I used with the online program, I could never get the return corrected. I decided to research the problem. After gathering all the details I still could not correct the problem even though I new exactly what the problem was. H & R Block has an online chat service that you can use to try to correct any problems. Well, although I dealt with 3 different individuals, the problem never got corrected. The first 2 just terminated the online connections when they could not fully help. I finally had one guy go step by step with me, and when he realized that I had correctly chosen all the options and that my complaint had merit, he asked me to call him on an H&R Block phone that he provided. When I called, I was told that the individual did not work there. He basically steered me to a dead end. So not only did their online program seem to have a fault, but their assistants did not provide any real help. Looks like they merely guide you through some procedures, and when that does not work they cut you off. Folks, do not use H & R Block. Remember you have been forewarned. I had to complete my taxes on my own and paper file. Unless I can get the credit card company to reverse the charges, I am out $29.95
When I filed my taxes I put $300.00 on the card for the savings and the rest went to checking. Well my problem is that my money is not in the savings acct. It is saying I have $-1.50 of money I never touched. I called the 1-800 number on the back and all I get is the run around. All I want is my money replaced on the card. They have you waiting long periods of time and transfer you from one person to another. I was charged a fee of $2.00 when I called to inquire about the card and did not even get anything resolved. I have sent various emails but no response. Can someone help me to get my money back. What I do not understand is how can I have $299.00 one week and on Feb. 23rd a negative 1.50. Can I please get some help retrieving my money back on the card? That was part of my tax return. Not having access to my money on a much needed basis. Having to borrow from family and not being able to supply for my two children's needs at that moment. I am a single parent mother who works very hard everyday and I do not need to be cheated with my income tax money I earned.
I got my taxes done at H&R Block. My federal taxes came back ok, but when it came to getting my state taxes I have had nothing but problems. I was told that it would come in no longer then 5-7 days; it has been 22 days now, and I have got nothing but a bad attitude from the employees. I have called every day since the state of Idaho has informed me that the check has been deposited into the H&R Block bank account. Every time I talk to them they tell me the same thing: We have printed the checks for the day, and yours is not here, call back; it wont be here any later than tomorrow. I have left several messages with no call back, and more importantly, no check. At this point I don't know what to do. I have tried everything even down to calling the district manager. I will never ask for H&R Block's assistance again, and I don't recommend them to anybody. I have made payment arrangements for all my bills, and have no money to pay them. H&R Block told me a certain date, and I went with that. Now I have no electricity. Thanks to H&R Blocks horrible service I have had nothing but problems and no money to pay my bills. Thats what I get for depending on a guaranteed tax preparation service.
I used the online version of the TaxCut Program to complete my taxes. My federal was successful, however my state was rejected. HR Block claims that it's not their fault, but my state's. Since TaxCut claims that they are in sync with the IRS and the states, they should be aware of any errors or problems that may occur. None such luck. When I did the check for errors procedure, the response from the program was that all was well and that they were ready for efile. However, there was a problem that TaxCut has known about and alerted me to the problem. Of all the free and lesser priced programs, I chose this one, not once, but three times. TaxCut, you're OUT! Only bad publicity with me as I spread the news! Just false claims about what they can do....
I used their on-line tax services, and I was told that I would have my money in 3-5 business days, and that was about 1 1/2 weeks ago. I still have not received my money. I have been calling every single day, and they keep coming up with different lies. If this continues, I will file a law suit because instead of them sending the money to my personal account, they sent it to their bank to get their money out. They don't deserve the money because the only thing they did was push a button. I am behind on my bills, and I really need MY money.
So I get my taxes done with H and R Block cause I want the quick money, I was approved; and they gave me my card. I activate that card and check the balance again and again and find there is NO MONEY ON IT. I call there 1888 number that you can't understand at all and reading off some paper to tell you some lies. They CHARGED me for the RAL; but yet I am not getting it, I have been trying to contact any one I can. It seems like NO ONE CAN HELP ME AT ALL. What should I do?
I had purchased a printer with my Emerald card and canceled the transaction three days later (ordered 2/2/08; canceled 2/5/09). I have been going around and around with HR Block over my money ($105) being returned to my Emerald card. Dell has sent 3 authorizations releasing the transaction and for some reason HR block will not put the funds back onto my card. I have been on hold with HRB numerous times (approximately 2 hours) at this point and have spoken with different agents who say they will send me to the holding department, but when transferred there...I am on hold once again...running up my minutes on my cell phone because I do not have a home phone. It also irritates me that I am being charged $2 every time I am even transferred to someone although nobody can seem to tell me why my money is not being put back on my card. If I am not having my problem solved why am I being charged? I am still wondering where my money is, and it is now 2/21/08. I also think it is absolutely ridiculous that they charge the fees that they do when it takes a whole ten minutes to file my w2's. It seems to increase every year. I look forward to tax time to get myself back on track, but HRB charges extremely high interest for their RAL, and charges you once again if you do the Emerald card advance. Why should they take more money than the average tax service? I see a lot of consumer complaints and also lawsuits pertaining to their practices, and with all honesty...would love to see how they get away with this. I work very hard for my money, and because they prepare my taxes, should I be shorted hundreds of dollars that I never see but help them take advantage of others because my money makes their business grow? It would seem to me if they are such a growing company they should hire more agents to handle these issues. I am a single mother of three, and although HRB may not care...$105 dollars is a lot of money to me and my family. I also feel frustrated that a few hundred dollars is what it costs to get my refund. I feel HRB takes advantage of many of us low-income taxpayers because they know we need money, and we need it now!
I took their Emerald Card advance loan for my tax refund. Then they sent me a bill to pay it back. I paid it by check, and they cashed it. Then they took it out of my refund again; now I am out $467.00 . They admit they have it, but they won't put it back on my card or give any reason for not doing so. This has caused me a lot of stress and time. I also had to go and take a loan to pay my bills that the money was supposed to be used for. I have called daily but only get promised that they will put it back. I've weeks of these lies. Guess I'm just out of luck. After reading the Consumers Affair web site, I know now what's up.
The tax preparer asked me questions regarding claiming my sons. I have 2 sons with my fiance. He claims one and I claim one. I explained this to her, and she asked me if I was married and I answered no, but we live together. She then asked me if I was having sex and that cohabitation was illegal in the state of Michigan. Since when is having sex relevant to filing taxes, and when did cohabitations become illegal in the US? My fiance's mother went to the office and spoke with both the manager, Carolyn and the preparer, Melani, to express to them both how surprised and offended she was and to have a formal complaint on file with them.
I tried filing my 2007 income tax return with H&R Block Tax cut February 1, 2008. Everything was fine until I got to the 8910 form needed for Hybrid car purchase. Could not finish the return until the form was available. Was told it would be available February 18. On that date I was told the form is still not available and would have to wait until February 21. I went on the IRS website, and the form was available. I tried to complete my return today, February 21, and the form is still not available with HRB. I used their ask a-question-screen and was told I would have to pay the $19.99 before I could ask a question. Why should I have to pay for something I have not received? I have been an H&R Block user since 2004, but if I ever get the 2007 return finished, I will never use them again. There must be something that can be done about this type of rip-off. I think H&R Block was fined a few years ago for over charging for returns. We had planned to use this money to help my granddaughter's tuition fee.
I downloaded H&R Block Premium software as it seemed cheaper that the competition. I later realized that it cost more due to the high e-file fee. This fee is not published on the web site. After complaining, I was issued a coupon code for a free e-file. Now H&R Block refuses to honor the code. Support incident # RES1092920. I spent over one hour on the phone to try to get them to honor our agreement. Refusal of the support person (Sean) to escalate the call to his manager.
I e-filed my taxes with H&R Block on February 1, 2008 and anticipated my refund to be direct deposited into my bank account on 2/15/08. The IRS sent my refund to H & R Block on 2/14/08 and H & R Block sent me an e-mail notifying me they had received my refund from the IRS and I could expect my return in 1 - 2 days. I called H & R Block on Monday, February 18, and was told they (HRB) had send the funds to my bank on February 15. I called my bank to verify and was told they had not received anything. I called HRB back and spoke with Shatoya and was then told I had asked for a Refund Anticipation Check and it would take 8 - 15 business days. I explained to them that I had not asked for a RAC and then put on hold for 40 minutes only for her to come back on the line and tell me that her manager, April, would call me back within the hour because it seems as though my bank denied my direct deposit. I explained to her that my bank would not have denied my deposit and the lady then hung up on me without asking for my number to call me back.
I worked for H&R Block in the call center, primarily servicing the Emerald card for the past 3 months until I quit last week. I could no longer deal with the atrocities that this criminal enterprise perpetuates. I have first hand knowledge of how the employees are trained and what we were told to do in order to take advantage of the lower income people that H&R Block targets. I have compiled evidence of several things, not limited to unfair business practices, among other violations and those that appear to be crimes. I am submitting a summary of my information to the U.S. Attorney's office here at the world headquarters in Kansas City, Missouri. I would love to be contacted via e mail by any attorney or individual who believes they have been victimized by these despicable vultures that call themselves corporate executives. My screen name is Gary Boley, a fictional name due to protective privacy measures I must take due to being an ex-employee. Lives were turned upside down due to many defects in the Emerald Mastercard and the way that it is presented to the less educated and the lower economic class.
I was sent a FREE copy of H&R Tax Cut in the mail. I decided to try it. I went through the whole process to find out it was going to cost me around $75.00 to file my taxes. I went ahead and did it because I was in dire need of the money and had already spent many hours working on it. Now come to find out that they are holding my tax refund for 2 business days with out any justification other than the fact they want to squeeze some more money out of me by getting interest on as much money as possible. If they are holding everyone's refunds, they are making money on what is rightfully mine. I will never again use H&R Block for anything! Our mortgage is going to be late because I was checking the website to see when my refund was coming. It said it was available today, and we needed a washer. The whole family has had the flu, and we were without a washing machine; so I bought one because the IRS website said my funds were released. I finally got an email saying H&R Block has my money but won't be giving it to me for a couple of days. The cheating liars!
H&R Block makes you pay a fee of $20 if you do not accept to have your refund put onto an emerald card. This card does not have your name on it. It states you are an H&R block client. We were able to use it for the first couple of days. Please note that fees apply to get money out of ATM's--larger than normal fees. Well, our money all of a sudden (as of yesterday) is not available. My husband called and was hung up on by a rep. I called and was told it should be up and running in about 2 hours, that their systems at Mastercard were temporarily down. Well here it is another day: No money. I called again and after a 25 minute hold, I was rudely told that they are down still and will hopefully be able to use my card soon. I can't tell my 10-month-old baby she can hopefully eat tomorrow or that my rent will hopefully be in by the 1st. We count on this money. They have fees to get it out and then a hold on it and no real explanation why. My 8-year commitment to H&R Block is broken.
I usually do my own taxes but due to a separation with my spouse I decided that I needed to have that refund right away and went to H&R. I opted for 8 to 15 day return, called on the 10th day, and found out that my return had been denied. The mistake was mine; I gave the wrong number for my son's social. I asked why no one had called me to tell me, and they were like "Oh, I don't really know why." She corrected the social and told me I would have the money the following Friday which would have been day 20. I am still waiting for my refund. I called the 800 number and was on hold for an hour, e-mailed my complaint while still on hold and received the reply to call their 800 number so they could help me. I was still on hold with the number! Someone finally picks up and was asking for another name and then said, "Oh sorry, I picked up the wrong line and put me back on hold for another 40 minutes where the line then rang and disconnected me! I called back and waited and was then disconnected again. I'm sure that none of my fees will be refunded, and I will never do any business with them again. I hope I don't get my car repossessed while I wait on MY refund, that I probably would have had by now if I hadn't been greedy and impatient and just done them myself as usual. Everyone that I promised I would pay in anticipation of the refund, I now have to call and beg for an extension yet again and hope they understand. I don't think walking 36 miles every day, one-way, to work will be feasible.
We took our info to H & R Block to have our taxes done. The girl started entering info in the computer and then stated she did not know enough about annuities to do this herself. She said she was going to send it to another office that day for them to do. I called back a week later, and she stated that she had been sick and not been able to send it. I then called back again after another 3 days and was told that it had been sent to another office. I was also advised at that time that it looked like we were going to get a refund. Finally I was contacted after 2 weeks, and after a threat to take my taxes elsewhere, a lady stated that she had gotten the info that morning but needed more info. She called me later and advised me that the taxes were done and that we had to pay $1500.00 in taxes. After 2 weeks of waiting they charged us $263.00 to fill our taxes out. We lost all around on this, and I will not take my taxes back to them ever after this experience.
I attempted to file my taxes as I always do with H&R Block online services, only this time I was not able to finish filing because I was receiving processing errors. I talked with a service rep using their live chat support; this service rep advised me to delete internet files. I tried and was still receiveing processing errors. I called into the customer service support and had a lady walk me through various trouble shooting steps and still could not get the taxes to file. We attempted to print the forms, and the program would not let me print. I was advised that issue would be escalated and a rep would call within 24 hours. I never received a call, but I was charged for their service even though I have yet to be able to use this service. I called again into the support center and talked with a supervisor and was advised that I was being charged for using their service--that filing was free. However I have not been able to use the full service since I was not even able to get to the point of filing. The service rep was very unprofessional and basically advised me that it was tough luck on my part, that I would just have to deal with the charges that are on my account and not be able to use the service. Unfortunately I had to go else where to get my taxes done since H&R Block was not helpful and will not refund the fee they charged to my bank account.
I have used H&R block for several years and this will and was my last time as they messed up my taxes. I have never claimed my daughter and I have gone to the same person for several years and now because of their mess up my daughter cannot file her taxes until mine are amended and she has to mail them. But H&R Block gave her a free coupon to get her taxes done as well as mine for next year. I don't think I'm going back to this place again. It's been 15 days and I still haven't gotten them back. I usually pay my personal property and house taxes and My daughter was getting her car licensed and neither is done yet.
I was pushed into obtaining my refund check on their emerald caster card even when I said that I was not comfortable doing so. They could not answer any of my questions because the preparers don't really know how it works either. They are just instructed to go over the highlights of it very briefly. Once I was signed on with it there was no turning back. It is a pain to activate and it takes the maximum amount of time allotted to get it. Once it's on there, you cannot get it back out without service charges. If you want the entire sum, it will cost you $20.00 for their trouble? Otherwise, $1.85 every ATM transaction that occurs with limited amounts that can be drawn. Which by the way, you won't know until it's activated. I called to see if once they get my refund check, and the bank could put a hold on the card and sent my actual check back to the office that did my taxes but that is not an option. I understand that some folks don't have bank accounts but if that's the case, they need to advertise it as such and should CLEARLY state what the charges are. None. Just perturbed and want to share this experience with others so that they don't get scammed by an H & R Block preparer to put money in their bank!
I have my taxes prepared by H&R Block each and every year. I can honestly say that I have never had any problems when using their tax services. Until last Friday, I had never filed rapid for my tax return. This year, I decided to use the Emerald Card that they offer. I need some cash really quickly. I haven't had a problem with my card. I am happy. After reading all the bad reports that other consumers have had, I just hope that I don't start to have any issues. I just wanted to say that I haven't had any issues. I actually like H&R Block. Thanks.
I used HR Block online services to prepare my 2007 tax return. I paid $44.95 fee using a credit card. My federal return was rejected for whatever reason, so I decided I needed to seek professional help from a CPA. Since I did not efile (which I was told was a FREE service) I wanted a refund of my money. I didn't use the software to prepare my taxes in the end so why should I have to pay for a service I didn't use?
In an attempt to withdraw money off of the H&R block Emerald Card Debit Master Card that was issued to me by H&R Block upon filing my income taxes, before the transaction was completed it was canceled. H&R Block Emerald placed a hold on the card for six weeks. They then informed me that the merchant I went to requested the hold. I contacted the merchant (Wells Fargo Bank), and I was informed that they did not place a hold--they only canceled the transaction, and the funds should have been placed back on my card within 3 business days. It has now been 2 weeks, and H&R Block Emerald has not released my funds. Instead they are on hold until 3/13/08 which is more than one month. I have been unable to pay my bills and my rent due to this problem.
Filed taxes online and instead of HR BLOCK depositing my federal refund, they withdrew the funds. `
I went in to H&R Block to have our taxes done. My husband was not present with me.The tax specialist talked me into putting our refund on their Emerald Prepaid Mastercard. I was a little leery about this, but she assured me that because my husband was not present with me, we would have to come back in to H&R Block the next day, and she would go over the paperwork with my husband. If any changes were needed to be made, she would do it at that time; then we could sign the paperwork, and she would e-file them. When we came back the next day, we sat down with the same tax specialist and told her we wanted to change the refund from the Emerald Prepaid card to a check from the IRS. She then told us that we couldn't do that because she already sent off our taxes earlier in the day. My husband asked her, "Who gave you permission to send them off without our approval or signatures?" All she said was, "Sorry". When the Tax Specialist explained the Emerald Prepaid card to me she told me it was free and no charge, but they charged $20.00 for a check from the IRS. In the end, the prepaid card has more fees and charges associated with it than receiving a check from the IRS. Isn't it FRAUD to file someone's taxes without their approval and signature?
I prepared my 2007 Taxes online with HR Block and can't seem to get any help from anyone with my problem. I had a refund that was supposed to be direct deposit onto an Emerald Card on Feb. 01,2008, and until this day my money has not been deposited on the card. I have notified the IRS, and they tell me that they sent the money to HR BLOCK BANK to be put on my card. Of course, not one single soul (after 15 different phone numbers) can help. They tell me they show no direct deposit, but they can verify the emerald card number. I even called HR BLOCK Regional office, and were they dumb founded. Again no help. I'm on my own to track down this money. I used to be a tax preparer for Block...but for this reason, I don't work there anymore. I also took out an Emerald Advance back in December, and they want their money; but I don't have mine. Stress of not being able to pay some of my bills that this money was going toward.
I used H&R Block to do my taxes this year (with Simple Pay). My returns were accepted on 1/15 by the IRS and were deposited to HR Block's bank on 1/21. It is now 2/8, and I was just told they had to mail me a check because my bank rejected the deposit. I have spoken with HR block over and over again for the past 2 weeks. Every answer was different; they of course blamed the IRS. I called IRS to confirm deposit, and it was deposited. One of the smarter of reps from HR block (and there were not too many) told me to call HR BLOCK BANK. The number is listed on their website, but be prepared to wait at least 45 min for someone to answer. I will never use HR Block again. This has been the worst tax experience I have ever had. It all has to so with their simple pay option.
I went to HR Block to apply for the Money Now loan that they now place on debit cards and did qualify; however, the rep who prepared the loan told me there was a $30.00 fee that would come off the top of the loan. But at the end of the preparation she told me that I would only get $440.00. So I asked why not $470.00 if HR Block fee is $30.00? She then told me that I would be able to get the additional $30.00 two days later, so I left the office to go and pay some bills only to find out the money was not on the card. I called the HR Block office, and they told me they were having some problem for the past few days with uploading the money on the cards, and eventually got the money two days later. The tax preparer nor anyone in the office had let me or any other consumers know of this problem. I feel as though I was misled in getting the loan because funds were not available when they should have been, and I would have chosen not to proceed with the loan. I also found out that the additional $30.00 was for a payment that should have been made on Jan. 15, 2008; but the loan was not due to be paid back until Feb. 15, 2008. The rep did not let me know of this. I was in the understanding that HR loaned me the money, took their fee, and I needed to pay back the $470.00 by Feb. 15, 2008. They had already taken their fee. I received a statement in the mail regarding the loan, but the amount due was higher than the amount I borrowed with additional interest totaling $519.00! How is this possible? These loans are misrepresented and are not explained to the consumer as they should be. I called and spoke to a rep about the additional charges, and he was very nice and told me that he would open a claim and send it to a different department for review. It is now Feb. 8, and I have not heard one single word from them.
I purchased the H & R Block Taxcut Premium + State product. After filing, I discovered a serious error on my State of Iowa return. The amount for Home Mortgage interest and points reported on Federal forms is exactly double what I entered when I went through the interviews. When I log into Taxcut and review what I entered for the different questions, the amount I entered for Mortgage Interest was correct. The Federal form was correct, but the State form is showing that I'm deducting an amount that is exactly double what it should be for Mortgage Interest. I called technical support. They agreed that it was a technical problem with Taxcut, but they told me to call the Tax Advisors. The Tax Advisor all but scoffed at me and told me to call Customer Service; and Customer Service had me write an e-mail and send it to some random e-mail address. The e-mail was not returned after 9 days, so I called Customer Support and demanded a refund of my fees. So, I've had to call Technical Support, then the Tax Advisors, then Customer Support, had to write an e-mail (which wasn't returned) then call Customer Support again - when the very first person I talked to recognized the problem. Customer Support said I can have a refund of my fees, but I'll believe it when I see it on my credit card statement. That is a lot of passing of the buck, even for an accounting firm. That was also a lot of waiting on hold, a lot of time out of my work-day explaining this mess all over again to each individual department and a lot of frustration. I'd say I've spent five solid hours on this issue. In addition, to contact the tax advisers, you have to log into Taxcut online and send them a message to call you. I did this, and 20 minutes later, I got an e-mail saying that there was no answer at the number I entered. This is not possible. I was sitting at my desk from the time I sent the request for them to call and when I got the message saying they couldn't get a hold of me. The web page where I submitted the request was still up, so I could see that I entered the correct number. The other phone that they could have possibly called was my cell phone, which was also at my desk. To get them to call me again, I had to submit another request...which cost me $19.95. They saw it as a second question, which isn't free. The refund for the $19.95 is pending, but it was even more hassle and evidence that their customer service and online application is broken. Both returns have already been accepted by both the IRS and the State of Iowa Dept. of Revenue. This means I have to wait until the State of Iowa processes my refund and sends it to me. Then I have to return the check with an amended Tax Return, thus drastically delaying my State refund. I used Taxcut not because I don't know how to do my taxes but because it is more convenient. Because of this error which is definitely some sort of bug in Taxcut Online, this experience has been incredibly ridiculous and time consuming both by the initial error and because I had to make four calls to three different departments, wait on hold and then explain this mess to them. I also had to write an e-mail, which is insulting because it seems like they are hoping most people will just let it go if they have to write a complicated mess in an e-mail in order to get a refund. All of the agents that I spoke to at H & R Block were nice enough but were completely clueless and seemed to want to pass me on to someone else. Furthermore, I now have a wildly overstated tax return accepted by the State of Iowa. This is the kind of thing that gets people audited.
H R Block has deceived the lower class and middle class taxpayers of this country with deliberate lies. The execs at H R Block knew that the banks and the government were not going to go along with the RAL programs they offer, and that everyone was going to be denied a rapid refund, so what do they do? They offer a $500.00 advance on your taxes and tell you that you MUST file your taxes before February 15th with H R block and repay this loan, or you will suffer heavy penalties. They did this knowing that once they sucker all the cash strapped humans into the $500.00 loan, they will come back to get their taxes done and to get the RAL that is not going to be paid. I have had my taxes done for the last three (3) years at H R block, and the only reason I had them do them is because I received my return the same day and then the next day. Well this year after getting their Emerald card and paying $222.00 for their service, I was denied by the bank for a next day refund. THEY KNEW THIS WOULD HAPPEN and said nothing before I agreed to have them do my taxes. How hard is it to do a 1040 EZ? Really! This is a deliberate fraud, and the excuses they give people are a joke. They try and blame everything but what they know is the truth. I want my $222.00 back for fraudulent and misleading advice. Blatant LIES! This is a corporation that is falling right in line with every other corporation in treating the American people like we must take everything they throw at us, and we have no voice. I hope they pay for this and someone teaches them a lesson about playing with the working class and thinking we are stupid enough to come back for more. I spent money I didn't have thinking I was getting my refund the next day, and the result is me having to pay late fees on my bills now while I wait for my money. I have the overwhelming feeling of me being a peasant and having to deal with these corporate losers in the first place!
My ex-boyfriend took my and my son's (not his child) social security cards, went in to do his taxes, and this guy at H&R Block allowed him to claim all of us on his taxes. We were never married, and my oldest son isn't his, so he shouldn't have been able to claim us. Now I have to wait 8-12 weeks for my return because it has to be amended when he shouldn't have been able to claim us--or at least I should have needed to sign something. It is illegal; and they need to fix it, but they just give us the run around when we call. And also when I went in to do my taxes at H&R Block, they let me file and said I would get my money in 1-3 days. I called back 3 days later, and they hadn't even sent them yet. I've been in an abusive relationship for 3 years, and I needed that money to get out.
I am having a problem with the amount I was charged for my preparation, especially as a return customer and a person who could have easily done it myself. (I actually did and then took it there for the sheer fact we got the Emerald Advance, and I thought we had no choice, which turned out to be a false assumption on my part.) I would have felt it fair to be charged $300 to $450 (sort of), but I was charged $737 and that was AFTER my $20 dollar. I believe that their fee scale is unethical and overpriced, as well as unfair to the consumer, especially consumers whose information is the same as it was in prior years and no data entry except maybe a few number changes are made by the tax preparer. All they do is import it into the new year from the old year and verify it. How much work is that really? Minimal. I would like for all of you out there who have had a problem to know the number for client relations, who may be able to help you. DO NOT call the 1800HRBLOCK number because that is just card services. Call 816-753-6900 and press 1 for client relations. I am still waiting on my call from the district manager, but I do have a feeling nothing will be done, because we did accept the fees. My point is that we sat there for 20-30 minutes before being helped, and then it took 1 1/2 to 2 hours for the lady to enter it all. You guys have no idea how inexperienced these people really are. They take the tax course, and that's it. I have an AS in Accounting, and I only utilize their services for the faster refund. Rest assured that in the future, I will be electronically filing on my own and having all of my money direct deposited into my bank account. Many years I have done the taxes ahead of time, and the people just have to enter it and it takes them forever; and then when there is a system glitch, they don't know what to do. They have asked several times why I don't take the class and work there myself. After seeing this site and my own experiences, I will NEVER work for them. I don't want my name associated with theirs in any way. It's a shame that a once reputable company established by honest men, has become entangled in our corporate greed and non-customer oriented society. I may actually file a complaint with the SEC or FTC about the fees that they charge. There should be a separate fee scale for new customers and returning customers, as well. No wonder they are one of the wealthiest corporations in the world. Out of an approximate $4000-$4500 refund, which was being counted on for a new place to live, we were charged 16 - 18% of our refund for very little work on H&R Block's part. For those of you who had a problem with the RAL fees, you should be able to get a portion of those refunded since the RAL didn't go through as expected. I don't believe it is a processing fee, I believe you are only supposed to be charged the entire amount if the RAL goes through.
I had my taxes done with H and R Block in 05. I had just moved to Florida in October. My son had only been living with my for five months. Hr Block said I could claim him. Come to find out I could not because he was not living with me long enough. I had paid the extra money to have the piece of mind insurance that is supposed to protect me if I am audited which I was. I ended up having to pay back over $4000 to the IRS. I have been making payments but I am behind on bills because H and R refused to honor the claim. They said that I signed the papers so it is my fault. They said that I must have told the tax pro the wrong information. Which is a bold faced lie. I told the pro when I moved and how long my son was under my roof and they said it was ok, go ahead.They never once mentioned that I would later need proof that he lived with me for over six months. Which he had not and that is what I told them. Now we are far behind on bills and our credit is suffering. We have not been able to catch up for two years. I have had to sell my truck just to get by. Now we have one car and two jobs and things are very tight thanks to a company that does not seem to care about customer service. They just want their money. I am not a tax professional that is why I went to them. They are suppossed to know what to do. My two year old could have done our taxes and got the same result H&R Block did.
I am unemployed right now, and didn't work a whole lot in 2007 because I was a full time student. My return was to be $308. They wanted to charge me $96 + $29.99 fee for not having cash on hand. I haggled the lady until she dropped it down to $49.50, but I still had the $29.99 fee to pay. That is 1/3 of my refund! I don't have the gas money to look for a job in the places I would like and need that money. I chose not to pay it, I'll learn to do it myself from now on. Remember you can talk them down if you haggle them. I got them down to $30 last year. No real damage, just frustrating!
On January 13th, I filed my federal income tax using the online Taxcut program from H&R Block. I selected the simple pay (yea right) option which allows H&R to take the fees from my refund. This was a mistake for me. This choice has the IRS direct deposit my refund into H&R Block's bank. They in turn take out their fees and are supposed to deposit the difference into my account. I should have chosen to pay the fees with a credit card which then the IRS would have direct deposited into my account. Well it has been 11 days since the IRS deposited into H&R Block's bank account and no sign of my money. I have called the Taxcut representatives, and they indicate they have no visability to mine or their bank account information. They directed me to the H&R bank phone number. I spent 48 minutes on hold before someone helped me. Of course, it wasn't the correct department. The representative told me that they are so busy with calls (complaints I'm sure) that they are having other departments answer the phones, but they can't help you. They said I would have to keep trying over and over until I got through to the actual bank. All I wanted to do is find out if the bank information is correct or did they even receive it, and what would be taking so long? I think they are collecting interest on everyone's money. Does anyone know of a phone number where I could actually get some help? NEVER AGAIN WILL I USE H&R BLOCK.
They have a stated guarantee that they will get you the largest refund on your tax return. They did not on mine. I tried to get a refund on my tax preparation. I called the 1-800 numbers and only got a brush-off. I asked to speak to a supervisor and have to wait over 30 minutes and refuse to take my number to call me back. I also called teh district manager in Topeka, KS; he doesn't call me back. Nobody at HR Block knows how to honor their stated guarantee! They also state they can get you the fastest rapid refund and RAL--guaranteed; but Jackson Hewitt got the faster refund for me. My biggest problem was the bad tax preparation by HR Block. I could have gotten more considering I have a dependent child. I asked them if it helped adding him, and they said, "No." Now I have to amend my tax forms. They are also falsely advertising their guarantee which is posted on HRBlock.com.
My husband and I went there to file our tax return, and we thought that everything will be just fine; we need the money as soon as possible. But NO, it came out so bad! When the lady was doing our taxes, she showed us on the computer that they will charge us $137 for 1-2 days, and we agreed because we really need the money--that's why we went there in the first place. We get to our apartment and saw they charged us $322! We just realized it was too late to go back there and complain or cancel it; we already signed! It says on the paper $215 for H&R BLOCK fee, and the $107 is for the bank fee. It also says that the estimated amount will be available in 1-2 days. The next we gave them a call and asked if our check is already there; they said not yet. So we called the next day again and got the same answer. It's over 48 hours; they never call us and let us know what's going on. So we decided to call again, and their answer was its gonna be 8-15 days. Their reason was because the bank denied it. We told them they should let us know that there's gonna be a possibility that the bank will deny it. Now we're cheated! We didn't have our money to pay the apartment and the bills.
I have my taxes done there every year. I received some money back but had to pay the IRS a lot more. I just received a letter in December telling me I owe the IRS $1500 more. I cannot understand what they did to make me owe more to them after they took most of my refund. I am afraid now when I do my taxes I will not get anything back, and I am in dire need of the money. What can I do to make them fix this? Please help me.
My husband and I chose to have out taxes done again by H&R Block; we've done so for 5 years without any problems. This year they had an Emerald Card to have our refund put onto; they said it would be activated by the next morning, and it was. I began paying my bills online using this debit card, and on the fourth bill I used my card on, it said my card was denied. I called the number on the back of the card and explained to the woman I was speaking with. She said I had put my PIN in incorrectly too many times. I never put my PIN into any online bills. All it asked for was the 3 digit CVN # on the back of the card. I explained this to her, and she called me a liar. Yes, she said, "You are a liar." I asked to speak to a supervisor, and she hung up on me. I called again, and got someone else. She said I had exceeded my limit of usage on the card. Now when I signed up for this card, no where on the user agreement does it state that you can only use the card 7 times in one day, which is what she said. I read the agreement to her, and she hung up on me. I called again, and they transferred me to the H&R block main number. They told me that I had used the card too much.... This is MY money, I should be able to use it as much as I like. I told her this and asked to speak to a supervisor and was told there was not a supervisor available. She proceeded to put me on hold, but forgot to mute her mic, and I heard her call me a ***** Some customer service! I went to the bank's ATM and withdrew $1000.00 from my card. I will try to get the rest tomorrow. Please, what ever you do, DO NOT get the Emerald Card: it is a rip off and a scam, and the customer service reps are extremely rude. I have bills to pay. We need new tires on our car, and groceries. I feel I was ripped of by having to pay $90.00 to get this card and not even be able to use it. I should be refunded $90.00 from H&R Block. I was on the phone for 3 hours and was spoken to like I was a criminal, cursed at, and it was a horrible experience.
I spoke to Mr. Arron Edwards and Russell Cartwright, both titled supervisors by first line call center personnel, about the payment of my mortgage loan by others not named in the mortgage contract. I asked H&R Block/Landsafe to refund payments made by others not listed in the contract in exchange for funds from my bank account, offering to cover expenses for this request and stressing the importance of my request to respect the contract I signed. I was told No, we are not going to refund any payments made from anyone that are directed to this account. We take money from anybody. I asked why I was not notified of the transactions, and the response was "We don't have to notify you; that's not our job." This mortgage was transferred to H&R Block by Option One Mortgage without my consent or opportunity to respond. The publicized separation of these companies is a scam. As a result I will have to suffer the cost of counsel and the possibility of losing the ownership of the property.
My wife and I went to the H&R Block because H&R Block told us they can get us the money faster with additional fees. We chose 1-2 days. Once we did our taxes, we saw a charge of $147; when we got home we looked at our paperwork and saw that there were bank fees for the fast loan. Fine, we got ripped off. When the 1st day came up, they did not have our check that we paid for. Next day we called no check. Finally we called them again letting them know the 2 days is up. When we called they now told us that the loan has been denied, and we have to wait for 8-15 days for it. H&R Block now tells us that the bank we paid for can deny the loan. Now their excuse is it is the bank's fault, not ours. I kept telling them knowing that it can be possibly denied you should have told us at the beginning. And again the manager states the bank has to inform you. When asking the manager when were you going to call us, he says only if we got the check for you. That's like saying they knew there was going to be no money, and they were going to have no intention of telling us that. We had to buy some groceries for the kids; all we came down to is the rent money for our apartment. Thinking that we would have the money in 1-2 days we went and bought some food, which bit into our rent money. Not a problem, we thought at the time until now. Now we don't have the rent money and have to pay more money for the late fees. Also we were going to pay the debtors on next week to avoid bankruptcy now that all the creditors are working with us. Now how is someone to believe my promise when I broke my promise, because I was misled?
I filed my 2007 tax return with H&R Block on Jan 4th; it was accepted on Jan 15th. On Jan 25th the IRS released my refund for $6,109.00. It is Feb 1st, and I have still to get any word about my return from H&R Block. I also used Simple Pay, which is a funny name for such a horrible service. The IRS says that the company is holding it in order to get the $30 fee, but that it should not be for more than 3 days. I tried to contact H&R Block about the simple pay restrictions, because they don't disclose anything about this service. I actually was told by a terrible customer service rep, Michael T, that I would have to wait another 16 days for my return because I chose simple pay. Why call it Simple Pay? All it does is delay your return. The web-site gives no real answers, and the online support is awful. I was actually cut off without an answer and told to deal with it. I am outraged and appalled that this company can play with other people's money. For a $30 fee, they are holding my return for days after it was released by the IRS, and this is just wrong. What is the point of e-file if it takes longer that via regular mail? I am asking for my fee back once I get my return. I refuse to pay for a false claim made by H&R Block. I will never use this company again, and it is very sad to see that I am not alone in this awful scam. This affects all families because you expect to use the money for home repairs, bill, vacations, and things of that nature. In our case our kids are without medical care, and we use this money for them and to get yearly check ups and to keep up with vaccines and things like that. We are a low-income family, and we are greatly affected by needless delays such as this. Our kids health should not come second to a fee for an already free service. It's just crazy.
I decided this year I would use H R Block's Simple Pay (which has turned out to be not so simple). According to the IRS, my check was deposited on 1/25/08 (to HR Block bank). Now according to the tax cut representatives, the check should be deposited into my account within 2 days. Today is Feb.1, and I still haven't received my refund, although HR Block has received the simple pay fee. Now as I sit here on hold trying to get a corporate number, no one has a corporate number available. I have been given the run around all week, and I still don't have any answers; so basically HR Block is telling me it doesn't matter, and I just have to wait until they get to it, because they are backed up on the deposits. I have bills that are past due because I recently lost my job. Here I am thinking I would be in the clear by now. I also had rented a car for the weekend because I am currently looking for a new car. I needed transportation to go see the other vehicles. I thought I would turn the car in when I had the money to pay for it, which I still don't. I still can't turn it in because I don't have the $240 to pay for it....so I wonder what the bill will be by the time HR block decides to release my funds? My bank account is currently overdrawn $120 because I assumed HR block was trustworthy.
I filed MY taxes there; they put my husband as the taxpayer, and he isn't. He didn't have any income in 2007 or 2006. I told them that I was the taxpayer, and they said his name had to be first. Now they're holding my money because he owed child support for a 22-year-old. They never told us to fill out an injured spouse form; they said they would do it after the fact ,and now they don't return our calls. I can't get my money. They need to return calls! I can't buy my husband's meds he needs, my rent is due, the electric will be shut off, and my husband uses oxygen. I can't get my child to school with no gas. This is very disheartening. We need that money and fast.
On January 14, 2008 I filed our taxes using the HR Block online program Tax Cut. Everything went fine; I even chose the Simple Pay option like I have for a couple of years now.(simple pay takes the processing fee out of your refund) I even use HR BLocks Emerald savings, which is where my Direct Deposit is going after the $70 in fees for Fed, State, and Simple Pay option. The IRS did their first deposits of the year on Friday, January 25, 2008. Mine was one of these deposited. I called HR Block to see if my money was there on Friday and was told if it wasn't there by noon, it would be there by midnight. On Saturday morning, I was told the same, and then again on Sunday. By Monday, I was furious! I called them again, after being put on hold numerous times, hung up on by people who didn't want to deal with me, or transferred between departments. I was told it would take one to three days for the money to go into my account. Well, Monday was the 3rd day, so today, which is Tuesday morning, no money once again! They are borrowing almost $6000 of my money, interest free! After having been on the phone this morning for 2 hours and being passed around once again, I'm told that the wait period is one to three business days from when they receive the deposit from the IRS. How convenient for them, that they get interest free loans from consumers! Well, tomorrow is the 30th of January. The IRS website says if I haven't received my deposit by the 30th, to contact them, and they will look into it. I would love to be able to report HR Block for theft and fraud. I'm ashamed of HR Block. I had worked proudly as a receptionist for them for 5 years and brought all of my friends and family to them either online, or in an office. My car is about to get repoed, and I have other late bills, all of who think I'm lying, and stalling when I told them I would have their money on Friday, oops no, I'll have it Monday, oops no it will be Tuesday, no maybe its' Wednesday instead. Also, I'm using part of my return for a down payment on a mobile home, but now that they think I'm lying about having the money coming in, I'm not sure if I'll get the home or not.
I am a single mother of two and buried in bills after the holiday. Having filed bankruptcy this year, I needed money to try and get my bills paid and try and rebuild credit. I went to HR Block on January 18th, against the protest of many family members. I was told good news on how much I was getting back and then was talked into the anticipation loan. I told the person doing my taxes that I had filed bankruptcy and would not qualify for any type of loan and did not want them to be putting any points on my credit report by checking it. Was told no problem. I would have no problem qualifying for the two-day turn around. I told my teenage daughter who is always seeing me worry about bills that Mom would get enough back to pay the bills on time, plus some. So of course my girls and I left happy that we could see a light at the end of this tunnel. More than 10 days later I only had empty promises to many bill collectors as well as to my girls. I have no money. I am upset and worried, and my teenager is angry that this company made a promise that they did not keep. So not only am I scared that things will get shut off, I am having to explain to my girls why this place made us believe that we were going to be ok--and lied. So H&R Block, what do you want to tell my girls about dishonesty? I am crying and upset. And if I would have done what I went in there to do--just a direct deposit--I would have paid less to HR Block. I would probably have my money in my account by now instead of calling every day looking for it. By the time I get this money I will have additional late fees and charges. I will have possible late fees, shut off's--but the biggest upset is having this company build up me and my daughters' hopes, to crush them with their lies. That is the biggest let down of HR Block: they are building peoples' hopes of a easier future with money that belongs to us any way. They are preying on the lower to middle class who are living from pay check to pay check with hopes of a safe and fast tax return. And then they take their huge fees and do not care about the consequences. They need to be held accountable for their actions--as I am being held responsible for the actions of the promises I made to my creditors because of this. An acceptable consequence would be for them to refund all fees related to this transaction. I have learned my lesson: I will never use them again.
I filed my 2005 and 2006 federal returns through H&R Block's Web site after the IRS decided to no longer provide electronic filing services. The first two years the returns were filed free, since I meet certain income and age guidelines specified by the IRS. For the 2007 return everything went as usual (visited the site, signed in, provided the W-2 information) until just before filing when the site insisted I provide a credit card number or bank account information for a fee of $14.95. Information on the pages stated that if the IRS accepted the return, e-filing was free. At this point I just wanted to get the return filed, and because I knew I met the free filing guidelines didn't think the charge would process so I gave the information. Within about 24-36 hours, I received a message that the IRS had accepted the return. However, Block did process the payment. I backtracked and explored their help topics while trying to find some contact information (which is not provided in their online filing area) and found that they claim that users must visit the site through a specific link provided in an e-mail invitation for free filers. Well, I didn't receive any such invitation this year, and when I clicked on the link provided on the help page to the free filing topic area, the Web site returned a 404 Not Found error. I tried calling their 888 number but was told by a recorded voice, "We are sorry, but your call cannot be completed at this time," and Block hung up on me. Thereafter I found an e-mail contact form which I filled out (including day and night phone numbers) to demand a refund. According to their site I'll be contacted within 48 hours. It has now been 24 hours and I haven't heard a peep via e-mail or telephone. If I don't receive a refund of this fee, which is at least twice as much as other tax preparers listed on the IRS' providers page, I'm going straight to the state Attorney General, the Better Business Bureau, and the IRS Office of Professional Responsibility. Block unfairly charged me $14.95 for a tax return that should have been filed free of charge with the IRS. It is clear from information I provided in the return (date of birth and income level) that I meet the IRS guidelines for free e-filing. The way Block's Web site is set up you either provide payment information or you don't file. This is unprofessional and unethical, not to mention possibly unlawful. I wonder how many people who are not as tenacious as I am just hand over the money?
I submitted my tax return information on-line with H&R Block. The website states that it would take 8-15 days before your refund was posted. After waiting the 15 days, it kept saying that my refund would be posted the next day, the day after that, and the day after that. There is no phone number to cal, so you have to communicate by e-mail. Everyone I contacted gave me a different answer. It just seemed like they pulled whatever out of the air that was convenient to get me off their case. This is ridiculous. I had a text chat with one agent who couldn't even spell correctly. How am I supposed to trust them with sensitive information? I will make sure to tell everyone the POOR SERVICE I received with H&R Block and how no one should ever file with them again.
I completed my 2007 taxes using H&R Block online, as I have for the past 6 years. I used the Simple Pay option, that allows me to have my fees withheld from my refund amount (like I have for the last 2 years, and maybe even the last 3 or 4). In the past, my refund was always in my account on the day that the IRS said my funds were deposited. This year, however, my refund was deposited with H&R Block's bank (so they can withhold the fees) on January 25. Today is January 28, and I still do not have my refund in my bank account, nor will H&R Block provide me with a copy of their terms and conditions for Simple Pay when I call them on the phone. They won't fax me a copy; they won't tell me where online I can find a copy. I KNOW I did not read anything about H&R Block withholding my refund when I signed up for Simple Pay. They are telling me I should have my refund within 1-3 business days from the day it was deposited into their holding account, not counting the day they received the funds. That means it may be Wednesday (almost a full week) before I receive MY refund...the refund that I never consented to allowing H&R Block to hold onto for nearly a week extra. I consented only to allow them to take out their fees. I've never had this trouble in the past - why this year? And why not disclose it ahead of time? And for heaven's sake, why won't they provide me a copy of your terms and conditions? Is there something to hide? Like perhaps it isn't in the terms and conditions? It's very embarrassing to tell someone you'll pay a bill on a specific date and then not have the money. This is MY money, not theirs. If H&R Block has just been honest about the hold time, I wouldn't have used this product. I'm out the extra $30 I had to pay, and I still don't have my refund. The message boards online are flooded with people complaining about this. I'm curious to know how H&R Block can get away with holding people's money.
I was given an estimate of $1,929 and I was given a $500.00 loan which also had interest of $60.00 dollars upfront fee and an additional $60 to be paid on the 15th of every month which is the $120 to file. The money borrowed was all due on Feb. 15th. I went and now they claim I only get back $400.00. How can they ESTIMATE such a big difference? I owe them now and cannot pay, therefore this will only lead me into more debt. I know this is still early and this is going to cause me more grief.
H&R Block filed my federal and state taxes for 2007. I received a letter dated 12-17-07 from Louisiana Department of Revenue advising me that I owe $662.47 for tax, penalty, and interest that was filed by H&R Block. I called the H&R Office to report the employee to her Supervisor. The Supervisor, Sonya, asked me to come to the office with all my documents, since she admitted that files had disappeared from their office, and she would look into this and attempt to get get this taken care of. I took all the documents to Sonya at the office, where she copied them and agreed to call me within the week with results, stating she would attempt to get this refunded to me. Since then, I have contacted Sonya on 5 different occasions and have each time been led to believe she is still working on it. Now she doesn't even return my calls. This has put me in serious financial hardship. Furthermore, I not only paid for their services, but now I am paying penalties and interest for their mistake.
Last year I filed my 2006 tax return with H & R Block. That is when they had their special going on with bringing in your last pay stub and getting your return through rapid refund. I did this. Then when this year's tax return came in, the IRS informed me that my return was never filed because their was a mistake with form 4224, which is the dependent day care expenses. I never received any notice of this incident. Then I come to find out when I called H & R Block that I owe them that money back now. No notice, no nothing!
My family went to H&R block on 01/16/08 to file our income tax return. We have used their service in the past and have received their RAL. We were denied the instant loan which the tax advisor said was common as we are self employed and do not receive a W2. She assured us that we would have it in 1-2 days as printed in our paperwork. We received a H&R Block master card and when we called to verify our refund, we were informed that our loan was declined and we would receive our refund in 8-15 days. It seems unfair as our return is so simple to complete. It was done within 30 minutes and they charged us $247.00 for tax preparation. They use their loans to entice low income families in need of their refunds to use their service and charge outrageous fees. We could have used any local CPA or computer software for way less. I believe we even qualified for free tax preparation as our income qualifies us. I feel it is a scam and the tax advisor rushed us out, and misinformed us.
Last year I filed my 2006 tax return with HR Block. Deborah J. (tax preparer) typed an error on one of my dependent's social security. This error delayed me from getting my refund by a day late. HR Block charged me the same fee for filing rapid--1 to 2 days. I had also purchased the Peace of Mind Ext. service plan. When I complained about this to Deborah, her response was, "I'm sorry, just come in and resign the papers and you should get your refund the next day." A year later, I filed my 2007 tax return on 1/17/2008 at the same office. Mr. Wayne Valentine (office manager) prepared my tax return. I explained to him about the mistake Deborah made on my last year's return. He said that she should have reported this error becauseIi had purchased the Peace of Mind Plan. He also stated that he would take care of this matter himself and to wait for a settlement. Still waiting to get a response.
My husband and I filed our 2006 taxes on April 10, 2007. The agent told us that we would be getting $5000.00 back in taxes. Now, I dont know anything about taxes, that is why I take mine to a professional. Even though I dont know anything about taxes, I thought something didn't sound right. I questioned her 5 or 6 times, are you sure? how can that be? Her answer was the same, "I've entered everything and this is what I come up with." Then when she asked if I wanted the peace of mind insurance, I paused for a moment, and before I could say anthing, she said, "I really don't think you need it." And my thought is, my peace of mind should be that I'm taking my taxes to a professional, it should be done right! Well, it is now January 2008 and I've just received a letter from the IRS stating that my husband and I owe $5000.00 for the 2006 tax year. We took our letter and tax return to the preparer and come to find out, she made a huge error. Instead of putting $20000.00 for my husband's income, she put $2000.00. So now we have to pay all this money back. Because of having to make payments to the IRS, we are going to have to move out of our home and into my father's house, as there is no way for us to make these payments and pay rent and all utilities. Thanks a lot H&R BLOCK!
Back in Sept 2007 we received a letter from the IRS stating we owed taxes from 2005. H&R Block has done our taxes for years so we called them (office has off season hours Monday and Friday only) and after several attempts and the proof that we had indeed provided all the necessary information, they acknowledged they made a mistake and an amended return was done and we paid the amount. We had purchased the piece of mind guarantee so they actually owe us $3000.00. I have called the office which is the district office and spoke to the Manager, Elaine, who did our taxes for the year 2005 and currently. She is the one who made the mistake. We have spoken to the owner with the promise that we would get our money in 4-6 weeks. Now no one wants to own up to the mistake. I have called the regional office in Telxas, spoken to several people at the International World office as they call it in Kansas City to no avail. We can't even get poeple to return phone calls and when they do its the same story, "The check is in the mail." We are truly upset and frustrated with the company, and the people. So what are we suppose to do? I call every other day and will contiue to do so because its our hard earn money. Even the owner of the office in Mandeville, LA offered to give us a gift cert to get our taxes done this year. I have no idea what she thinks. All we want is what was promised with this peace of mind. and that is our money. Since this has happened my husband has had open heart surgery, and his gall bladder removed (all in a 3 week period). I have had to take off work to help in his recovery and when I don't work, I don't get paid. We have exhaused our savings.
I went to the Walmart store tax H&R Block and without my knowing, the lady slipped in a $500.00 dollar IRA and I know nothing about those things. After I had figured out what they did, I called and tried to talk to a number of people at Walmart and they said you signed and agreed to it, so there's nothing you can do. But she did it so sneaky, I didn't know what I was signing. So now I have this money in some IRA account and know nothing about it. I have no address to check it and don't know how to check it. I feel lost about it. I just felt sick about it. I will never go back to H&R Block ever again. Now I feel that I was cheated out of my money and yes, they said if I take it out, I will lose most of it in fee's. Please help. I am a single mom with 3 children and I really needed my money. I tried to get it back but couldn't.
We had our taxes prepared by H&R Block, Eastern Enterprises I, West Palm Beach, FL 33411. We have been notified by IRS that we owe over $2,000. I tried to contact that store and they are closed. We were directed to the H&R Store Forest Hill in West Palm Beach, FL. We left many, many messages for Marcella. All we need is some help on WHY since H&R Block did our taxes and we received a refund no less. I faxed my IRS letter to that store and as of today I have not received a call back. Today I called and their mailbox is full. Can you please help in someway? In the meantime, IRS is adding interest to our supposed OWE. Does not H&R Block stand by the customers? If I don't get any results, maybe a TV station could help me. We have been with H&R Block for many, many years and the issue in question was the Health Care Tax Credit, and I told my husband, she did not seem to know what she was doing. Where do senior citizens get over $2,000 to pay the taxes. We had, and I repeat, had faith in H&R Block.
In Feb 07, we filed our taxes online with H&R Block. They failed to file our taxes, but was paid for the job. We were given our receipt and told not to file as H&R Block would do it. We were never called and told they did not do it. On Dec 10th 07, I recieved a letter stating that the IRS hadn't received money and that we didn't file. H&R block says they aren't responsible.
The 1st Miami H&R block office that did my Federal and NY state tax, made errors. I purchased a peace of mind agreement. By the time the IRS notified me of an error, the HR Block branch was not open (post season) so I had to go to the district office. The district office took MONTHS to review the return and the NYS explanation of errors. Finally one person was able to do an amendment and that came back from NYS with errors! I don't get calls back so I have to go in every week. I am told week after week that a supervisor has it locked in their office, and they apologize for the delay! They are unprofessional, not knowledgeable tax preparers, and I will never use them again! I paid taxes to the IRS for NY State, but apparently I should have gotten a refund.. Those thousands of dollars could be gaining interest in an account. Also, I am spending time and gas to get to the HR Block office weekly. And, early in the process I took time off from work to go to HR Block to address the mistake.
I paid extra to H&R Block in case of mistakes on tax returns. Now I owe IRS $4200. Just read many reports from people dealing with same problem who cannot get H&R Block to deliver. H&R Block needs to own up to its promises.
In 2001 my father went to his local HR Block to file his taxes, as usual. They gave my father incorrect advice on his taxes and filed incorrectly. They continued to file incorrectly for him from 2002 through 2005. The IRS is now telling my dad that he owes money for all those years, money that has during the last 6 years accrued interest and penalties. My father has had Multiple Sclerosis for 20 years. This terminal disease is very stress related, so my dad leads a very simple life. He can't work, and hasn't been able to for a very long time. The stress of this horrible situation caused his large intestine to fail permanently, adding an additional $100,000 in hospital bills. The stress of H&R Block completely dropping him after 35 years of being a loyal customer, and refusing to help or correct the problem that THEY CAUSED has also made him lose the use of his legs. I have tried going to the Better Business Bureau, the media, and H&R Block WORLD HEADQUARTERS. No one will answer me, and no one will help. How can a company get away with this?
Mrs. Brown told me not to file a form, and now it is costing me and my wife over $5,000.00 which we do not have. I have tried over and over to talk to someone but no one was there for us. I took out the peace of mine Mrs.Brown told me to take out for $29.00. Why did I have to take it out if no one will help us went we need it the most.
I went to H and R Block for my 06 return. First of all they didn't add all my w-2s to my return. Was offered the rapid refund but turned them down. Was told refund we be in 8-15 days and would be sent my checking account. In the mean time i was out of the country for all of April. Returned and found out my refund had gone missing. Contacted H and R they said my refunds had already been sent to my bank. Checked with bank and no refunds had been deposited. Call IRS to check and was told the same thing it had been sent two weeks ago. But amount of taxes paid in and refund from my copy and theirs was completly differnt along with my bank info. Dont know where the money was sent IRS is now tracing where the money went. H and R Block now says that this is just a small mistake and they will investigate it. And file an amended return for me free.
I have had my taxes prepared at Block since I started working, I have never had any problems. However, I recently received a letter from the IRS stating that I owe 3500 in taxes for tax year 2005. I immediately took the paperwork and letter to my usual office, and was told that they would see what the issue was. Weeks go by with no word so I started trying to reach anyone who was working on my paperwork. After trying repeatedly with no retun calls, I started leaving messages with the manager. I finally received a response, and was told that my peace of mind claim was being put though the appropriate channels. When I asked what to do about the IRS deadline, her response was not to worry about the deadline, that its not a big deal. After nearly 2 months of this, I received a letter that my peace of mind claim has been denied, that I can contact the regional office to contest. I spoke to another manager at a different office, and the mistakes just continue. The original mistake came about becasue a first year preparer had worked on my information, the others came about because the agents at the offices are just badly trained and misinformed. The manager I spoke to yesterday was going to resubmit my claim, but I will talk to a lawyer if I dont receive some assistance with this tax bill. Also, I also find out that I owe the state an additional 657 for 2005.
I purchased the Piece of Mind guarantee at HR block on April 14, 2007 after working with HR block tax professional for several months. I was convinced to do the Easy Pay program to pay off my federal taxes, which was a loan through HSBC. I overpaid my state taxes by over $1000, and the IRS is taking money from my account, as well as HSBC bank for my federal taxes. I am being double charged for my federal taxes. I am unable to get help from ANYONE at HR block, at their offices, their phone number, or their online help. No one at HSBC can help me either. I feel like I've been scammed.
I filed my taxes with hr block in 2004 and i was told that my information would be confidential and i also signed. so they gave me coupons to give people and i would recieved 10 dollars. so i gave one away to a friend of mine and i wish i didnt. All of my information which included my ssn my daughters ssn the amount i recieved and was stapled to her copys she recieved from them. When she brought it to me i was shocked i didnt know if my info.. was suppose to be in there or not. it was not worth 10 dollars. what if she was a stanger. in result of this now im not sure if my info.. is in someone else file.
Hi, My wife and I visited the H&R Block office yesterday to get our taxes done. After being ignored for 45 minutes, we came home and made an appointment for 7:15 PM on the next day(3-26-07). We also called at 7 PM to confirm our appointment and we were told to come in. After 45 minutes of being ignored again, we walked out at 8 PM(office closing time). Do they have a policy of ignoring certain people or is this only a branch policy? There were 3 agents and only 2 customers and the third was shuttling between the 2 desks.
On February,19,2007 we went to H&R BLOCK to get help to file our taxes. 10 days later we get call from them tell us our check ready but the check amount was wrong so my husband did not take the check. My husband went back again to find out what happened but the lady did not explain to my husband, she just do is call amended and it was not even right the next day. We think she swapped our 1040 and 540 she sign it and dated march,1,2007 when we ask her about the original copies of our 1040 and 540 dated and sign on febraury,19,2007 she said what you talking about she had no idea. The IRS not have our 1040 original signed and dated.
My husband & I are separated and wants me to go sign the tax returns that he filled under married joint when he should have filled under married separated. When I called H& R Block to have it changed to married separated and to find out how much the returned was. The sales representative rudely answered saying that she couldn’t give me any information unless I came in and sign the papers and that she would not give any information until after I signed the tax returns. I do not want to be signing something that I am not able to know what is on the form.
On Feb 17, my wife and I filed our taxes through H&R Block. We usually file them through the army for free but I’m on orders for deployment to Iraq very soon so I needed to receive the refund as soon as possible to purchase things needed. We decided to go with the 1-2 Refund Anticipation Loan with the emerald debit card. After waiting 5 days, we still had no refund on our card so I called H&R Block. They told me that my loan was denied and gave me the number to the bank they had set it up with. After calling the bank, they told me that my loan was denied for unknown reasons. I’m out the extra fees for the 1-2 loan and still waiting on my refund 11 days later, unable to purchase equipment needed for Iraq.
Last February I visited H&R Block to have my taxes prepared. I am a single person, with an adult son living at home and attending college for engineering full-time. He has no income and I am basically helping him with everything, even child support, until her graduates this June. When I visited the preparer I took my son's birth certificate and social security card in with me and explained that he had not worked for the entire year. I told the preparer that I would like to claim him as a dependent; I was fairly sure that this would be allowed. The preparer was helpful in assisting me in finding a lot of deductions that I was unaware of, but that had to be listed on forms that added to preparation cost. At the end of the day she told me that it would not make a difference in my return if I claimed my son so I should not bother to do so. Well, it really made a big difference not claiming my son. I discovered while using Turbo Tax to prepare my own return that claiming my son provides me with an addition $3,200 tax deduction. As a result of H&R Block's incorrect information I was required to pay the IRS $1,071.
Linda of Lowell IN (02/26/07) When we filed our taxes, our check was kicked out because someone had already claimed our daughter on their taxes. I was told that it was probably an error in the numbers. I took the necessary steps in case it was identity theft. I contacted the FTC, Transunion, Equifax, and filed a report with the police. All this started within the first week of February. H&R had us file without our daughter and was told in a couple of weeks we can file an amendment with her on it. I told the agent to deduct all the fees so that when we file the amendment, all we have to do is sign it and send it on. The other day she called and said we can come pick up the amendment and the fee is $116.00. When I complained, they instructed me to go to the IRS to check up on tracing it back to who originally claimed our daughter. The IRS told us that there is no way to find out who did it.
HR Block has twice double-booked my tax preparation appointments and I will no longer use them to file my taxes.
I have used H&R Block's online free file service for the last 3 years. This year, I entered through the IRS.gov free file alliance website as usual, logged in with my existing username, and filled out my return. At the end, before filing, I was told that I had to pay $9.95 for e-filing (this is the price of H&R Block's usual Basic tax e-file product). After making sure that I did qualify for free filing, I contacted one of H&R Block's online live agents. The agent told me that H&R Block knows that people who have existing accounts can't free file, but that "we don't know when we will fix this problem". His solution was to create a new username and re-enter all of the tax info for this year.
I have filed my taxes for 4 years using the online HR Block software. This year, I decided to upgrade during the filing process to their Signature product to have access to an online tax representative with a couple questions I had. This proved to be the worst decision of my tax filing career. I thought this was increasing my filing price from $39.95 to $79.95 for both federal and state, which by the way the $39.95 is already a double increase over the past 3 years. In the end, it has cost me $139.95 as their fees are not clearly stated nor did I agree to something that is a bank charge of $29.95 which I presume is for the direct deposit. There was also $29.95 additional for the state return which I swear told me that 1 state return was included in the initial $79.95. Then the on-line tax consultant basically pushed me off stating she was the only one in the office when I called to get further clarification. There is no way they took any time at all to review my return so this service is a complete fraud in my mind. My boyfriend received the same software for $29.95 that I used for $39.95. I guess once they think you're a loyal customer, they just think they can charge whatever.
I have been filing my income tax with HR black for the past 10 years i have been charged so much for fees. I also have tooken out the insurance and the women explained to me that if anything happens with your refund we can get you a lawyer , well somthing happened and when the time came down no lawyer was provided. the women sold me the insurance for NO REASON. she was not able to assist me with my problem as promissed by HR block. I bills were not paid on time and my refund was delayed. no lawyer was provided. I have been filing my taxes for 10 years with this company.
On Jan. 5th my wife, with a power of attorney in hand, went into the H&R Block office. She was told that the IRS was not accepting returns until the 12th but she could have our "Refund Anticipation Loan" no later than 1-2 days after. She was approved for a "Money Now Loan" for $1700 of which she received a check for $1366.87. They deducted their $333.13 fees immediately. The day that our loan check should have arrived I called the Block office, was informed that we were denied the R.A.L. and that we would receive our funds when the IRS released them - usually 8-14 days. So not only do we not have our money in a Rapid fashion, we are also out a whole lot of it!
I got to the H&R Block online software through the IRS's website. H&R (and other companies) advertised offering free filing for those earing less than $50000. That was the only condition. After I had entered all of my information into the H&R Block software (which took a long time, because I had a lot of stock trades last year) it said I had to get a paid professional to finish filing. I tried to opt out but my form was locked and I was unable to access it. Since it was the weekend before the tax deadline, I went ahead, because I was worried I wouldn't otherwise have time to complete my taxes. The financial damage was $179 (the initial estimate was $119), even though I had entered all information. Also, the incompetent H&R agent screwed up two forms, before my taxes could be filed. I ended up spending 2 days calling H&R and getting the problems rectified. Additionally, I had a $20 coupon, which also could not be applied, even though it was valid (and H&R admitted it was valid).
I purchased their "peace of mind" plan because it is supposed to cover any errors prepared by the advisor. They did make multiple mistakes costing me over $1000 in additional taxes. I have spent days trying to speak with someone who can help me resolve this. The problem is most of the offices close down so I had to find a regional office. Longwood is the closest (1 hour away). They are open three days a week so I had to leave a message. The peace of mind offer is a scam. H&R block makes no effort on their part to resolve issues and their "experts" are not so experienced. I would suggest to anyoned using this company to be very cautious. You will undoubtedly spend significant out of pocket expenses (time, fuel, etc.) trying to rectify any errors created by this company.
My husband and I had our taxes done for the first time by H & R Block. While our previous accountant charged $125 for filing all of our forms (my husband is self-employed), H & R Block charged us $436! Their reason is that each form has a fee. One form cost $53 to fill out!! How can that be when it is all on computer and the computer does the work for them? They use the same forms as accountants do, but charge outrageous fees.
Yes, had I known there were all these hidden fees for filling out a costly form, I would opt to take their course instead and do my own taxes. Or better still, to do the easiest procedure on-line and lest costly, about $20.00 and pray I don't get audited. I'm finding out as well that H & R Block is a real rip off and the only people getting paid out of this procedure are the tax preparers who join forces with the IRS, who seem to want every penny you put into your pocket. I was told by my tax preparer that the cost would be around $300. Then she called me back an hour later, and said she made a mistake, misread the computer, and the cost whould be $500, but she would take off $79 which would bring it to $429. My total cost of filing out forms and the form was $439.75. Reason for the fee, "your taxes are more complicated". Whatever that means, so is it for others who have no knowledge about preparing taxes.Yet nothing has changed in the past three years, except the price of letting someone else "rip you off".
I feel as though I was totally overcharged for services rendered with my tax preparation! Damages suffered were to my pocketbook and my faith/trust in H&R Block! Corporate America strikes once more!
I've been going to H & R Block for the past few years. You get your money the next day and I've notice there are charges in there that I feel are unfair. I had to pay close to $400 in fees to have my taxes done. I think that is insane when I can use turbotax and get my taxes in a week for just $40. I think H & R Block deserves to be investigated because they're ripping off the poor people who work really hard for their money and have to pay ridiculous amounts for their money they worked for. So for whoever reads this Turbotax.com is the way to go from $10 - $75 you can do your own taxes and have them within a week.
H&R Block forgot to file State form 568 in 04 and 05 for my taxes on my LLC. Now im up against penalties, interest and fees for 04.
I went in to file taxes with the expectation of being able to recieve my income tax return quicker. I agreed to the 8-15 day return with a $320.00 fee and was given a pin to check the staus online. The pin was incorrect and when I went to the IRS website to see where my refund was, I was to expect it 21 days after I filed. I had already promised crediters and debiters that I would be able to pay them on the last day that was promised which would have been the 15th day.
I went to H&R Block to have my taxes prepared for the first time this year 2005. I usually do them myself, but this years were a bit more complicated, due to getting married and my husband joining the Military. I called the local H&R Block office and set an appointment. On the day of the appointment I arrived a few minutes early and was serviced quickly. I gave the "Tax Specialist" all of the W-2's, and his response was "Wow, you worked in a lot of states this is going to be expensive" (that was not reasuring to hear). I asked "How expensive?" and he replied "About $100.00", that didn't seem to bad to me, I had worked for the same company in MO, IL & now CA. My husband worked in MO and now for the military. As we sifted through the W-2's and got figures on what my refunds would be and what I would owe if anything, I asked "Can I deduct my personal property tax from the MO state taxes?" he replied "I'm not sure but I doubt it". As we started to finish he stated, "You will be getting a refund of X amount from Federal, X amount from IL, X amount from CA, You owe MO $1,100.00", I couldn't believe it, I have never owed state taxes before. But I trusted him, (they are tax professionals, right?) and asked if he would check into the MO state taxes further, he agreed and we set an appoinment for the following Tuesday. I returned to the H&R Block office, to find out that my "tax specialist" was not in that day, but that someone else would assist me. As I waited I wondered if I had made the right decision, by using this company. After talking to another "tax specialist" she showed me why I owed MO state taxes, I agreed and she gave me the balance I owed for H&R Blocks services -- $237.00!! I asked why the cost was so high, and she replied because you had out of state taxes. Well yes I did, and the original amount qouted to me was "around $100.00" so why so much more? With no other choice to my knowledge but to pay, I did. I thought I had to, because they had E-filed some of the taxes.
Because I had recently gotten married, and had to file tax forms in both Ohio and Kentucky, I went to H&R Block thinking that they would be able to straighten everything out. The associate who was assigned to me was obviously very new to the United States, but I tried not to be biased. However after I explain my situation to him, it was obvious that I knew more about taxes than he did. He was simply a data entry person who took my forms and entered them into the computer. I was capable of doing that! While he was entering the data I asked him how much they are going to charge us, because it seemed like we could do a better job, and was told $144 - JUST for my husband's taxes, and not mine! I've used accountants in the past and never spent more than $50. Spending $144 is absolutely ridiculous, considering there was nothing complicated about my husband's forms. I took my forms, walked out and went straight to Walmart where I bought TurboTax.
My wife and I went to H&R Block to have our taxes prepared (our 5th year to use them). After going through the entire process, we were told that our taxes could not be filed because the Form 1041K from last year could not be removed from their system because "the IRS hasn't provided H&R Block with updated software." We were told that it would not take more than "a few days." THIS WAS OVER TWO WEEKS AGO. No one from H&R Block has called us, and when I contacted them two days ago, I was told that "the software still is not updated." This seems ridiculous to me---why would H&R Block need to wait for software from the IRS in order to update their own records?
I called H&R Block to see if they did Utah taxes. They said yes they do taxes from all states. I told them my taxes were simple and that I could do them myself but needed them e-filed. I asked the price and they said $49.95. After they prepared my taxes they gave me a bill for $180.25. They said the reason it was so much is because I have a dependent. The next day I called to talk to a manager because it just didn't seem right. She informed me that Utah taxes are an extra $60 and that I must not have given them the right information. She said she had IMPORTANT clients to talk to and hung up the phone! I feel that I was completely mislead on the price and treated very unprofessionally.
I was told to claim head of household because I was paying child support and also paying medical and dental for my son who attended school here in Illinois. I was audited and ended up paying $4000,00 making payments I called and faxed and went into the office and they basically shrugged me off. I WILL TALK TO A LAWYER.
I used their "free" file service this year linked to from the IRS website. This is the third year in a row I have used their free service and I have never had a problem with it before. At the beginning of the session, they asked if I wanted my refund to go to a special debit card. I read far enough into the terms & conditions to see that fees applied and went back and said no to the “offer”. After going through the whole process of entering my taxes I kept waiting for the screen where they ask how I wanted to receive my refund- check, direct deposit or put some in an IRA. That screen had been there every previous year. After clicking on the ‘next’ button one time too many, apparently they filed my taxes without asking how I wanted my refund. When I looked at my printout there was a bank routing number and account number already filled in which I did not recognize. After calling and spending hours on the phone- and being told to call the IRS despite this being H&R Block’s problem- supposedly by filing for free the only way I can receive my refund is on their HSBC debit card. This despite the fact I specifically said I did not want it. I did call the IRS and there is nothing they can do to stop my return from being processed or my refund from being hijacked by HSBC. The person I talked to did say that this year he has received more calls complaining about H&R block doing this to people than people calling about tax questions. So beware and do NOT use H&R block to free file.
I've tried multiple times to access their 'Free File' link from the IRS website, and with different browsers - Mozilla, Firefox, Internet Explorer - and I keep getting the same error message, 'Session Timed Out'. Funny thing about this is, I noticed that the signin page directs you to this page automatically, without trying to load anything else - and then kicks you out to their main web page, where they offer to file your 1040EZ for 5.95. Attempts to contact H&R Block via their complaint form proved to be useless - the server handling complaints apparently has had issues for 2 weeks now.
In 2003 we used H&R Block for tax prep. Only having used them 1 year previous. In 2004 we went back to H&R Block and a different preparer found a mistake that their office had made the year before. It was a giant mistake that cost us 5,000.00. The preparer that made the giant mistake was no longer employed there. We went to them because I had recently started working for myself and we no longer could prepare the return ourselves. I thought, H&R Block, they are reputable, they know what their doing, boy was a so very very wrong. They had made a mistake that we didn't catch, but that was due to the fact that we could no longer prepare the return and relied on them. We didn't catch their mistake because we didn't know how to file the taxes, hence the reason for going to H&R Block. But according to them WE SHOULD HAVE CAUGHT THEIR MISTAKE, so it was our fault they made a mistake. Along with that years mistake the preparer for 2004 made some mistakes of her own that would have cost us a evern more money, along with the fact she only put maybe 1/3 of my write offs on the return, like my travel distance, when we gave her the total milleage for the year she put maybe 1/3 of number we gave her. We caught that mistake along with a few others, like leaving out a form that was needed, before it was filed by going to a CPA and paying him to redo 2 years of tax returns. Which by the way wound up being only half of what H&R Block charged us for 1 year of tax preperation. When I called the office I was of course livid to say the least, but they got mad and had an attitude with me. You would think for the money they charge for preperation they would have the guts to back up their work. We will never go to H&R Block again and will forever make sure people are well informed of the mistakes they made on our taxes for 2 years out of the 3 we went there.
I filed my taxes on 01/19/2006.My return was to be $2721.00. I have filed for nearly 10 yrs. having a 1099misc. every year it cost $142.00 for preperation fees. This year they tell me it cost $208.00 (they tell me they're not sure why , must be the forms, note: I use the same forms every year. I filed the same as every year for the RAL to receive it back in 1 to 2 days. This year they tell me I was declined because I owed the bank (HSBC) $142.00 from last year. Last year the $142.00 was taken out of my return along with the $99.95 charge for HSBC bank fees.I contacted the IRS about this matter and they disclosed to me that the entire check was directly deposited in HSBC's Bank in Buffallo N.Y. on Feb.18th. which means I did not receive my return this year in 1 to 2 days instead I have to wait untill the banks receive my check from the IRS and then they will loan me my money minus their fees.That will take about 3 weeks. I just can't figure out why I would want to have my check sent to them first so that they can take fees to loan me my money.I have been reading up on all the H&R and HSBC scams. I only wish I would have investigated them first.I am a low income tax payer with EIC credit. All that H&R Block kept informing about was ther Peace Of Mind deal that would cost me $39.99 additional so that I could feel secure that they did their job right.
In 2002 I withdrew money from a 401K plan and needed to ensure that I had my taxes filed correctly because I believed if anything I would have to pay a penalty. I brought all my papers and when the work was done, I was advised that I would receive a refund of 1093. I repeated 3 times that I thought this to be incorrect but the preparer said the computer took and that my age (not at the time of withdrawal evidently) said I had no penalty or fees to be paid. I just received an audit report which now states that I owe $1054. I advised H&R Block and they in turn advised me that because I had not purchased a Peace of Mind contract they were not accountable for the error. I paid them to do my taxes and feel I should not have to pay more for Peace of Mind when the error was their's. In addition, under that standard contract they need 4-6 weeks to determine if they are even accountable for the interest that is/has accured/ing. I don't get it. Because I need to protect my own credit standing I cannot let this go without making some effort to pay the monies owing but hopefully others will benefit from my experience and find some reputable person to do their returns without having a letter show up just before Christmas from IRS. I do not know what stand I can take other than to inform others of their money grabbing system and unprofessionalism in dealing with other people's money.
My 2003 taxes were calculated incorrectly apparently by H&R BLOCK here in Farmville, VA since I have just received a letter from IRS stating that I owe them $537. plus tax interest of $46. making my Total Amt Due IRS: $583.00. H&RBlock has done my taxes for many years always in MD until I retired and moved to VA. where the 2003 tax return was done. After I sent in an my 03 Taxes, I received a statement of more taxable money and I had an Amendment done by H&R Block here and returned my tax refund. Do your records show I DO OWE this additional amt. in taxes for 2003 of $537. + $46. Interest? Total Amt due is $583. due by Nov 2, 2005
I paid H&R block to file my return electronically in 2000 and arrange a payment plan because I owed taxes. They never did. I didn't discover this until almost a year after the fact.
I filed my VA state taxes in this office. Unfortunately, the appropriate forms were not completed, so I received a document request form. A Form Copy of State of Residence Return was not included. I have since been contacting the office to get this situation rectified, and have not received a return call. Please let me know who I can fax my paperwork to to complete my state taxes, and refile for my refund.
I used the online service that claimed for $49.95 you would receive online assistance if needed. When I needed it I could not contact anyone. I then had to pay another $29.95 to speak to a tax prepare person. After the review was done I was told I would only be billed and additional $100.00 When I argued the charge saying I had already paid another $29.95 I was told that the fee only covered 3 questions and I had asked more than 3. When I actually only asked one. This person did not help me to find any write offs I might have missed and told me I had taxes owing when I knew I could not possibly owe anything. I never finished I went to another preparer and had my taxes done for $9.95 I owed nothing and have writes ofs to use next year. They are a rip off, false advertising.
We received a notice from the IRS stating that we owed $967 ($49 is interest) on our 2003 taxes. It appears that my husband's retirement 1099 was not included. I made an appointment (had to wait a week to get in). Took the 2003 folder & found that I did not have a copy of the state taxes they had prepared for us. The deadline for payment is May 11, 2005 so I mailed a check today. After many calls I was told by the Davenport office that the person in charge of the Muscatine office had been given my message and it was up to her to call me. They were supposed to get me a copy of the Iowa State Tax & double check the calculations on the Fed Tax return. I have yet to hear from them.
Last year a friend paid H&R Block to file my taxes for me via electronic file through the computer. We went back and forth with needed information for over a week, and finally they said it was sent. I believe the cost was over $100.00. I was out of town and was expecting my [large] refund,and kept checking regularly, as I had overdue bills and life insurance premium past due. I returned home several weeks later, having spent a lot of money checking my bank balances, as the refund was to go directly into my bank account. When I returned I called the IRS info line to check the status of my refund and was told my tax return was never filed. Thank goodness I had printed out a draft copy; otherwise all that information would have been lost. Subsequently I had to file by mail. I paid many penalties for late payments and my friend was out the money he charged on his credit card. Furthur,they NEVER told me that they did not file -- had I not checked prior to 4/15 I would have been in default of the tax laws.
I calmly requested then argued with H&R; Block Tax preparer and his Manager last year. I even called the home office in another state for customer complaints, to no avail. My concern was my sister who lives in rent-control Metropolitan Housing, receives Food Stamps and makes very little income. She wanted a quick tax Return. I could have filed it for her FOR FREE on the internet due to her Income. She ended up paying $160.00 to H&R; Block for an E-Z FORM! I told them she is mentally-challenged which they had to have picked up on. They defended themselves saying they throughly EXPLAINED the process to her and she AGREED to it! They forgot to MENTION to her that she could get it filed for free at many places or by someone with a computer (ME) due to her low-income status and short-Form filing form! Up until 2003 I filed it over the PHONE for her in about 15 minutes, both her Federal & State Tax! She got a ride to the office and thought she would surprise me because I always do her taxes for her every year and usually she gets it back in 2 or 3 weeks. That "instant refund" was like drawing a POOR MOTH to the flame! H&R; Block would not concede and did not return one red cent to her! Her total refund was about $600.00 and they took $160.00 of it to file an E-Z Short Form!
On 2-3-01, my husband and I went to H&R; block to use the electronic filing system that they advertise to file out Federal Income tax return and have our tax return direct-deposited into our checking account within two weeks to expedite this return. We paid $100.00 for this service. On 2-14-01, I received a call from H&R; block that told me they have my check there to be picked up. I questioned this because it was supposed to be direct-deposited. The woman told me that the check was from a finance company, Household Finance, who does the rapid refund financing for H&R; Block. They took $266.95 in fees out of our return for bank fees, etc. We did not apply for this rapid refund loan at any time for any type of financing. On 2-15-01, I went to the office to see the manager, Tina, who said this was an error on their part and that she would submit a refund for the finance charges on a loan that we did not apply for nor request. She also stated that we would get out $100.00 back since our tax return was sent to Household Finace Corp and not direct-deposited into our account, which was the service that we paid for, which made a total of $366.95. I have not received my money back from them. I contacted Tina on 3-1-01 and she was surprised that we still have not recieved a check and told me that Pat Perry handles this who is the overall supervisor for Burlington County NJ. I contacted Pat and she said, "Who told you you were due money back? I've never heard of you". I explained the situation, that somehow, I was defrauded $266.95 of my return and it was due back to me along with a $100.00 refund for a service I did pay for and I didn't receive. I am out $366.95 ($266.95 of which were taken from my refund for bank fees and finance charges on a rapid refund loan that I did not apply for nor receive in 2 days which the rapid refund advertises. This Pat Perry will not take my calls or reply to the written faxes I have sent her office including a written document form the Marlton office saying that I did not apply, nor authorize this service or its fees. Jessica should write a certified, return-receipt-requested letter (faxes and phone calls are NOT sufficient) stating her case and demanding a full refund within 15 days. If she doesn't receive it, she can sue the company in Small Claims, Court.
