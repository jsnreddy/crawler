TurboTax doubled the amount they were supposed to take without me confirming the payment.
At the end of my return, which by the way was much easier to use last year. It told me it could not finish because I had already put my tax return through, I had not! Within minutes the $34.99 use of TurboTax was taken from my debit card, still no confirmation on taxes be completed. I called for help a couple nights ago on their site. VERY frustrating! The person I was speaking with would not speak up, did not know how to answer any of my questions, put me on hold many times and then came back on and asked for my social security #. I was very uncomfortable with the whole conversation and told her so. Still never got an answer. What is going on??? I have used TurboTax for more than 5 years now and I will never again!
I paid $91.98 for the TurboTax Premier software. My federal return was fine and was accepted by the IRS; however, TurboTax duplicated my dependents information on the State filing, which resulted in an exemption being claimed twice. This meant that I received less than HALF the refund that TurboTax had calculated. Being highly unsatisfied with the software duplicating error, I called TurboTax and requested a refund, which they flat-out refused to give, stating that the tax forms were "self-prepared" and that they have "never received another complaint about this issue." After several phone calls and the continued refusal of refunding my money, I finally had to call my credit card company and request a refund that way. I will never use this product again, and I especially will not fund a company who refuses to issue a refund when a product fails and a customer is completely dissatisfied.
I've redone my taxes twice, three times now trying to figure out what I've done wrong. It's not me.. it's TurboTax.
The program repeatedly asks you to opt for MAX. You may say no 4 times, but you miss on one of the opportunities and you are stuck with a $44+ bill for a service you neither want or need. I've spent 20 minutes on the phone trying to cancel it and now I have been bumped up the line and await a call back (before 10:45 pm). The first customer service person eventually determined she was not authorized to deal with the problem. The program completely missed the exemption on PA taxes for two retirement items. It said my state return was ready to go with taxes calculated on retirement income. Beware the MAX trap.
Intuit hides behind unattainable customer service. I have tried 4 times, over three month period to get a refund for a software program. This was acknowledged by customer service as an error in the software was promoted. I was told a credit would be forthcoming in a week. This is now three months old. Today I tried again, and customer service put me on hold... I waited twenty minutes and then hung up. I have launched a complaint with my credit card company. Intuit has NO customer service and hides behind a wall of incompetency. Do not buy their product.
I've always done my own taxes, and I've used TurboTax (TT) since it became available. Not perfect, but it's worked and I'm comfortable using it. So far. Now TT says next year they will no longer support Mac using Mountain Lion OS or older, nor some really old Windows OS. Now, Mountain Lion isn't very old - it's just that Apple puts out a new OS very frequently. Each time I have upgraded my Mac OS there have been significant problems: some loss of data or function. I absolutely do not want to upgrade from Mountain Lion! So it looks like I won't be able to use TT for next year's taxes. Intuit has screwed up in the past. They quietly transferred some functions from Deluxe to Premier version without mentioning it to anyone. So people who bought Deluxe had to rebuy the more expensive version, which caused so much outcry that Intuit was forced to issue refunds. So I'm hoping there will be another outcry about the need to upgrade Mac OS. For myself, if Intuit doesn't continue to support my OS, I will just have to try H&R Block software or (gasp!) go to an accountant next year.
I filed my taxes with TurboTax and it was accepted by the IRS. Three weeks later I received a letter from the IRS talking about the health care form 8889 was not submitted with my tax returns so I reviewed my taxes and discovered that the IRS was correct. TurboTax didn't include the form even though I entered my info into the system and then I received a collection e-mail saying that I owe TurboTax money. I spoke with a rep and was advise it wasn't TurboTax's fault that my refund was put on hold. I advise the rep that once I receive my refund they will get paid.... They didn't care if I was able to provide the IRS with the form
DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. I have used TurboTax Premier for several years, and have been generally satisfied. A few times I needed help and customer service techs were good in getting it solved. The 2016 edition is NOWHERE NEARLY AS GOOD. Because of unclear instructions, we made a double entry in the sales tax section. After 2 different sessions of over an hour each, the techs admitted they could not figure out how to solve the problem. Three different times we requested a supervisor, and were told one would call us. No one ever did. The final summary says everything is OK, and we can go ahead and file, but we are hesitant to file a return we know has an error in it. Though the chances of an audit are small according to TurboTax, the hassle of an audit is not worth the risk. Bottom line: we can not correct what we know is an incorrect entry, and neither can TurboTax. Don't believe the supervisors will contact you. They won't.
What happened? I've been using TurboTax for over 10 years and this 2015 software is a joke... So confusing. It doesn't even have a link to find a business code. I have to Google it on a separate computer. Taking it to an accountant next year.
Progressing through the software was fine the first time - if you go all the way through. But, if you're like me and you want to do a little, then pick up where you left off once you get more documents together, well, it's very, very confusing to find out just what is missing. You literally have to answer all the interview questions again, just to change one tiny part of a tiny part of the return. And then when you get a hold of tech support on the phone, the call is often misrouted, and then dropped after you listen to agents talking but they can't hear you. Don't buy this.
They offer to assist you with all these services only to not respond or help out when you need help the most. I ended up having to pay so much money and facing penalties as a result of their service. And all they could say was their system does not show what I am telling them. DO NOT, DO NOT EVER USE THEIR SERVICE UNLESS YOU WANT TO BE SCREWED AND PAYING MORE MONEY THAN YOU HAVE TO.
Dump this garbage. Do not use at all. They nickel and dime you and just when they make you think everything is free, they slam you with unrefundable shopping cart items. DO NOT USE. I'd rather file my returns in crayon than use this garbage. AVOID.
I am a nonresident alien in the United States and mistakenly used TurboTax to file my taxes this year. I think it is extremely irresponsible of Intuit to not mention anywhere in the whole process that a nonresident alien cannot file using this software. I paid for the Deluxe and it was a complete waste of my money. I now have to do a more complex amended return and pay a tax consultant for it. I later also discovered that they have a partnership with Sprintax for nonresident tax filing. However, no mention of that was present anywhere in the process. I have lost that money and will now lose more money for the amended returns. And in addition, I have unnecessary stress now due to the whole process. This is absolutely unacceptable.
I used TurboTax software for several years and was generally satisfied. That began to change about two years ago when they removed the Schedule E from the Deluxe version of the software. I grumbled a bit but paid up for the Premier version. After reading many bad TurboTax reviews, I decided to try H&R Block this year. In order to complete my return, I need some information from my 2014 return that Turbotax has stored for me. The Catch 22 turns out to be that I can't get access to my 2014 return unless I pay for their 2015 software or pay for something called Plus that is $29.99. My thinking was that a good company would certainly not do that to a long-time customer, so, with some difficult, I got a phone number for their customer service. The first agent told me that she would send me an email with what I needed to retrieve my return. No email came, so I called again. This time I was told that the only way to access my return was to pay for 2015 software. I will not use TurboTax services in the future.
I used TurboTax again this year. No problems last year but this year was different. I filled my taxes on January 14, 2016. When I filled they kept pushing these added features to help me get my maximum refund. Of course they charged me for it but I figured I would try it. When all was said and done I was supposed to receive 2,232 from federal 826 from state of SC and 160 from state of NC. They sent it in and on January 19, 2016 it said accepted by the IRS. So, I figure great and I wait for the time period they said it would take to direct deposit it. The date goes by when I was supposed to receive it and it still says processing. So, I call TurboTax to find out what happened. They put me on hold and then tell me a tech will call me back shortly. They never called back. Well, I finally got a letter from the IRS saying I will only get back 1,072 federal and state of NC. I have to pay 458 now and state of SC stayed the same at 826. I am upset because I paid over 100 dollars for their service and none of it was accurate and no one ever contacted me about it. So, I will probably not be using TurboTax next year again because I feel it's a fraud.
I hated my TurboTax experience and now that I have submitted TurboTax has locked me out of access to save and print my forms. I cannot get any specific information and am now unable to complete FAFSA forms due to TurboTax. I feel the IRS should heavily penalize TurboTax for withholding our private information from us. I also think that so many people do not trust that their taxes were filed properly, that TurboTax should be fined for each mistake. Even 1 in 5 (Generously Assuming consumers can make mistakes not due to TurboTax's bad product) fine for using government resources would be a large sum in my estimation.
I have used TurboTax to file my taxes for the past few years and never had a problem. Even when I filed last year, I had entered the wrong routing number, but received a paper check by mail within two weeks without having to do anything. This year is a joke. I filed with them as usual, and kept checking the IRS page to see when I would be receiving my refund. I filed on the 2nd of February, and the irs page said it was sent on the 10th. When I still didn't get a direct deposit by the 15th, I had figured something was wrong and a check would probably be coming (plus the TurboTax page didn't say any problems occurred, and I hadn't been contacted via email or phone call about any issues) so I figured I'd wait for the check. I finally decided to call the irs to see what was going on, because by this time it's the 25th. I called the irs, waited on hold for 45 mins, finally got through to someone who explained to me that my money was sent to TurboTax on the 9 of February! So I had to search all over the Internet for a phone number for them, because most don't work. I finally found one and was on the phone with someone for over an hour for her to just end up giving me a number to their "bank" they use that does the deposits, which is a company I have never heard of and had no idea would end up with my money. So I called this "bank" and they said I had to verify my account by uploading mine and my husband's drivers license and it would take 7 business days for them to verify the account. Then after that it would take 2 to 3 days for them to send a check. Then I have to wait for my check to get to Illinois from California. At this point, I was livid. No one contacted me to say there was a problem! They've just been "holding" my money for no good reason. I hung up the phone and did what they said. Here we are on the 7th day, and the account is still not verified. I called this morning and they're telling me to wait a few more days. Why does THIS COMPANY HAVE MY MONEY? I was supposed to have this money in hand a month ago and now who knows when or if I'll even get it. I have a family to support. I need MY money. All in all, I will NEVER EVER use TurboTax again. And if there is even so much as one penny missing from my refund, I will get my lawyer involved.
I have used TurboTax for years and have been generally satisfied with the program. However, I've never had any contact with customer service until now. This year, like all the years past I purchased what I thought was the Deluxe Fed/State program. Upon completing my federal return I learned that the CD I had installed was only the federal return and that I would have to buy the state return for another $39. To say the least I was not happy, but what could I do since I had already installed the program and finished my federal return. After buying the state program I returned to the store where I purchased the software to investigate how I ended up with only the federal return. After close scrutiny I learned that the only difference in packaging between the Deluxe Fed and Deluxe Fed/State is the word "state" in very small yellow font. Other than that, the color and design of the package is identical. To make matters worse they were displayed right next to each other on one huge display. I double checked my receipt and confirmed I paid for the program I had selected. Realizing what had happened I resigned myself to paying extra for tax services this year. However, I wanted to voice my complaint to Intuit Turbotax and so hopefully next year they would design the packaging more clearly. After a thorough search I was unable to find a way to send feedback to Turbotax regarding this issue. I found a page of hundreds of reviews with glowing reviews, but there was no way for me to submit my own. I finally submitted a question asking to "voice a complaint". After completing the form a phone number popped up. I called the number and waited for the robo call back. When I finally reached a live person I was basically told there was nothing that could be done. When I explained I wanted to make a complaint I was given the address for corporate headquarters in Mountain View, with no department or office. I have little faith that any letter I write will end up in the appropriate hands. I'm extremely irritated with Intuit Turbotax and even though it was my mistake I feel the packaging was misleading. I can't believe I am the only person this has happened to. The lack of customer service is astonishing. Intuit has lost a long time customer.
I had been using H&R Block for a the last few years without problems. This year when I was going to download the 10-40 EZ app from H&R I noticed the ratings were down to a 2 star average. I figured I'd give TurboTax a try. Boy was this product horrible. Not only was the app constantly trying to push additional features on you at the end of entering all of my w-2s I am informed you need to pay an additional fee to file. Bait and switch at its finest. On top of it all, I still haven't received my federal return and it's been nearly 3 weeks. The IRS WMR site still says it's being processed. While using H&R in the past I would receive both my fed and state returns in right around a week after filing. Horrible experience and from what I can tell I wasn't the only one. Definitely telling people about this and will never use Intuit products ever again.
If I could give this product negative stars I would. It is slow, calculations do not work properly. Data entry is confusing, error screen links do not work, constantly locks the computer requiring a restart, help screens are not helpful at all. Terminology on help screens does not match terminology on data entry screen, thus making error correction nearly impossible. Length of time to complete a return is approximately 5x longer than using tax software. Do not waste your time or money on this crap!
No tax help as advertised. I have four logged calls into them on a case number. But not once have they put me through to an actual person that will help despite being on hold for over 30 minutes twice and now 64 minutes. The last person did offer a refund but that is small consolation after putting 8 hours of work into the product and having four years of returns with TurboTax. Now need to pay a professional.
I had a problem with deleting a form. Contacting customer service is very difficult once you figure out how to even get to them. When I finally got someone to call me back, the person was totally useless. I needed to have them tell me how to delete a form in my state tax return because their online help is no help, and when I tried to delete the form by clicking the delete button, it would delete and then come right back. The person that I finally got ahold of after about an hour, didn't have a clue and then transferred me to someone I knew couldn't help me with deleting a form, in the tax or audit department. After waiting for an additional 20 minutes for someone to answer the phone, I hung up in frustration. After buying the more expensive Premier software, I now find myself having to manually fill in my state tax return because TurboTax is fairly useless as far as I'm concerned. Note - It is unbelievably difficult to get help from this organization.
First of all, it was not easy to locate a Customer Service number to speak to a live person as to why they have not sent the funds to my checking account. It turns out the IRS sent my payment over 10 days ago and they had it on hold because they had to verify additional information. They don't send notification via mail or email. I was supposed to find this out on my own because according to Kim ID** of Santa Barbara Tax Products Group, it is my responsibility to follow up. Not that I haven't been trying. Their hold time is like 25 minutes with no option of a call back. She said that this was in my agreement. I asked her where, and she didn't even know exactly. I had to wait for her to tell me where I could find that it was my responsibility. Finally she referred me to Page 4 of the agreement. Nowhere in that page does it give me detailed instructions of what I need to do to receive my refund, not even a phone number. I see why people pay over $200 to file income tax, to not deal with situations like this. Never again. I am going back to H&R Block!
Filed my taxes with TurboTax online. Made a simple mistake of putting in wrong digits for direct deposit of my refund. Now paying 130$ out of my return to have some company I never heard of to send me a mailed check of my return. Will never ever use this company again for my tax return. Thanks for showing your true colors. Never thought a digit out of place would cost me 130$... Thanks for the ripoff.
UPDATE: I received a call from a customer service representative in response to my complaint, and was issued a full credit for the online software as requested. This is appreciated. I would still recommend that Intuit revises its marketing strategy to make clear what the differences in their products are, UP FRONT so that you don't find out after going down the long path of frustration. A clear policy of upgrading and changing product would be a plus as well. It should not have gotten to this complaint level after several unpleasant calls, but I appreciate that they have resolved it to satisfaction. The download product is still excellent.
I used them for the first time to file my taxes. In the past I have used a personal tax company to file my taxes but thought I heard many people tell me TurboTax was free. Not at all free. I thought and agreed to pay $100 plus taxes for their service and I thought that was because I had a mortgage now. I thought it would be easy to do the direct deposit option (not knowing it would cost even more) but found out that there was money missing from the deposit. I called TurboTax (which they don't make easy to contact them) to see what the mistake was. They made me wait for 20 minutes, plus once I was on with a Rep they constantly put me on hold for long periods of time. Finally they said these are additional fees and taxes that added up to an additional $50+ dollars. Shouldn't you tell that to your customer at the beginning, instead of behind their back? If you want to throw away your tax refund use this terrible company who takes advantage of their customers!
I filed my return with TurboTax. First of all, they charged me a $34.95 bank fee which wasn't disclosed until the end of the process (after you're already invested in the whole process). But apparently, I transposed two numbers for my direct deposit bank account. I called the IRS and they said it can take up to 3 weeks. So I thought the bank was holding those funds (because it had been longer than 3 weeks). The bank could verify that it was an invalid bank account number and that they returned the funds to Tax Products Group (AKA TurboTax) the day after it was supposed to hit my account. So they've been holding my money all this time, even though it was returned to them immediately. Then, TurboTax is saying it'll take another 3-6 weeks to process a check and they're going to charge me another $150 because "THEY" have to issue the check. Screw this. I'm so pissed. I already gave TurboTax almost $200 for my return. Now they're going to charge me additional money and hold my refund longer. I should have just mailed it in.
I used Intuit - TurboTax online to E-File this year instead of HR-Block. Out of curiosity I also did a mock entry with HR-Block online service. The results were staggering!! TurboTax upgraded my service from FREE by demand to a service that was $91 compared to HR-Block's $57 and my total returns (Federal & State) were $600 + less using Turbo. Luckily, I'll go back to HR-Block next year and regain my losses. Turbo's blow & co$t you dearly.
I've been using TurboTax software for years. I usually purchase at the big warehouse store. This year I went online through the TurboTax website. I only needed the deluxe version because I own a home and take a few simple deductions. All throughout the process of filing, the software pushes Audit defense and other products continually. When I reached the filing stage they hit me with the fee for the software needed to file the federal, a separate fee access software for the state and then after all that, they hit me with an additional fee to file it electronically because there was a refund. Which by the way is the software they push to sell you on during the whole process. I tried to just print out the forms so I could mail them in for FREE. Nope, can't do it. They want their fees! Very disappointed in what this product has become. I used to recommend them to everyone to save money but for this price on a simple return, I'd rather pay H&R Block at my local Walmart. Goodbye TurboTax.
For the past numerous years I have been using Turbotax online and being charged for it. I thought it was because I had deductions. Come to find out they have been using the EZ form and not any of my deductions for my taxes and charging me a fee. I am now trying to get my taxes amended, what a pain that is. Needless to say I will not be using them next year.
2015 was the first time I filed on the internet. I've always done it on paper before. Turbo boldly promotes a free edition of federal and state filing so I tried it. My taxes are simple. No dependents no deductions just the standard deduction. It took about an hour and fifteen minutes to complete it. Throughout the time they would suggest I upgrade to a deluxe edition, which I declined and always chose the free edition. At the end they said I had to upgrade to view and print my completed taxes. They were misleading and lied and screwed me over. They should be fined for false advertising. I ended up doing my taxes on paper and again lost faith in some of our businesses. If youre looking for a free edition to file don't trust TurboTax.
I am a small Chapter S Corporation and I have been using TurboTax for several years, happy with the process... up until this year that is. I use TurboTax Business to process my S Corp but then take the K-1 output to use as input into my personal taxes for which I use the Home & Business TurboTax. Here's the issue: I began my tax preparation at the end of January of this year, everything was going well... up until it was time to move to my state taxes and as is always the case at that point, I am prompted to purchase my state business tax forms. Upon reaching the state tax form purchase pop-up window I was told that the forms were not yet ready and I was given a future date of Feb 18th at which time they would be ready. I tried back on the 18th only to be told that the date was now the 24th... and then on the 24th I went ballistic. I tried contacting Intuit and spent a whole 3 1/2 hours on the phone with various agents trying to resolve the issue and to find out what was happening. Without those forms I cannot complete my Federal and State corporate taxes and I will be fined a $200 penalty at the federal level... I don't know what the penalty will be at the state level. One of the agents told me that the forms were available and that she suspected that the problem was with my version of the software (I bought it new at my local Best Buy). She recommended that I speak with Intuit's tech services and get them to send me a new version of the tax software. But instead of putting me through to Tech Support she threw my call back into the queue for a regular agent... and there I waited another hour just to find out that the first agent was wrong. By this time I was so angry that I was turning red. No accountability with Intuit, no integrity, only misinformation and a gross lack of concern for my situation. As of today... the day on which the state forms were supposed to be ready... again they have pushed the date out now to March 4th. I highly doubt this is accurate, based on their track record. I have no idea how to proceed. I will be hit with penalties for not having my Corp Taxes filed by March 15th. Here's my advice: DO NOT EVER USE INTUIT/TURBOTAX!
I am an extremely dissatisfied customer. I filed my taxes with TurboTax January 18th, was approved the 19th. I received an Identification Verification form from the IRS on the 12th, was verified IN PERSON at the IRS office the next day. On Where's My Refund my refund was accepted by the IRS and I was given a direct deposit date of February 24th. I was excited because I was finally out of the woods... NOT. I checked my account this morning to find that no refund was there, not because of the IRS, but because the local bank that TurboTax used has taken it upon themselves to HIJACK my refund and "hold" my money. I have called this company twice and have waited for over an hour TWICE for someone to answer the phone. I do not wish nor will I pay for this unwarranted "service". If the IRS' verification of my face and ID wasn't sufficient I don't know what is. While I was on hold I researched your company online and found COUNTLESS instances of Santa Barbara Bank holding consumers' refunds to accrue fees and interest. This is illegal and entirely unethical. I am at my wit's end with this already tedious process and if I am accessed any fees outside of my already agreed upon fee for TurboTax and fund transfer, I will move forward with litigation. I agreed to you transferring my funds to my Bank, USAA on behalf of TurboTax, but because of this and your company's awful reputation I will no longer use TurboTax because they failed to do their research. I would never agree to a local bank that I have never heard of "holding" my refund for my protection. This is extremely upsetting and I do not want anyone else to experience this horrific service. I forwarding this correspondence along with countless complaints and claims of scams located on any online search, to California's Better Business Bureau, Attorney General's Office, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, TurboTax and the IRS. I will also create a detailed complaint and post it to every complaint board I can find. I am currently trying to call your company and I have been on hold for 45 minutes already. I will utilize the time that your company is using to not answer the phone, to warn other consumers. I will make it my business to make sure that as many people as possible know not to use your "bank" for any service. You DO NOT have my permission to ''HOLD" my money. I verified my identity at 6 AM EST. Now, I regret sending my identification to such a untrustworthy company. Release my money immediately. This company is claiming to protect against fraud as commit fraud themselves. I am expecting a swift and professional resolution or I will be sure that this company regrets dearly choosing to hold my little $1,363 refund hostage.
Filed taxes with TurboTax, stated the IRS deposited my money 4 weeks ago. Called TurboTax asking why it wasn't deposited. They told me to call the IRS. I called the IRS and the IRS stated that the money has been deposited into a TurboTax bank (Santa Barbara) and that bank should deposit my refund to me... They told me to call that bank. I tried. Called 4 times with no response. WHERE IS MY MONEY? How come TurboTax didn't tell me the process in which it takes an extra 6 weeks to get my money if I ever do?
Well I have used TurboTax in the past with good results, minus the hidden fees. This year I filed my 2015 taxes and TurboTax said the IRS had accepted the taxes and all was good... NOT! I waited the 21 days and still no direct deposit. Called the IRS which was 1-800-829-1040 options 1, 2, 2, 4 and 1. After 35 mins, come to find out my taxes have been rejected / on hold and that I will be receiving a 12C tax form in the mail. Once all the documents which the IRS is requesting has been sent it will take 2 weeks to process the forms. Once the forms have been processed and approved it will take up to 6 weeks to get my money... TurboTax will not help me because I filed on-line and did not buy the CD version from the store. People read the fine print!!! TurboTax will not stand behind you if you do not purchase the CD and I would not even trust that. Now I am out 110.00 or so just so I can re-file my taxes again on my own and wait 8 weeks for my money. I cannot believe I was stupid enough to give them money at all. I will never use TurboTax again. Very unreliable...
Going on 15 years, varied financial and social situations and still no problems and no errors. We have total confidence in this system. Have your records ready and do your homework. Garbage in = garbage out. If you remember this, you're in good shape with Turbo Tax. As long as you've kept records and have all the required paperwork you'll have no problem. Live assistance is available 23/7, you can pause or stop at any time, then continue. The live and/or online support is always there. Security is intensive. As far as we know, we've never been hacked. If/when it's needed, live support is something you can count on.
Very easy to do and verified their accuracy with what I thought was the correct information. Living overseas brings up many extra tax headaches but TurboTax covered almost all of them with ease. Just plain simple language with a more personal touch. I felt secure using this software being the reputation of TurboTax. Lacking in certain forms for overseas persons but there are so many. Would be nice to have special tax software for this. There are 8.1 million of us expats overseas!
Turbo Tax continuously updates its programming to stay on top of any and all updates and/or changes to tax laws and policies. Its programming prompts the user to check for updates several times during use, to ensure the end user can take advantage of any last-minute changes. Turbo Tax offers free tax guidance and helped me when the IRS so-called customer service blew me off. The Intuit tax expert I spoke to helped me with an update that saved me thousands of dollars. No one could have asked for better. Turbo Tax offers two options... step-by-step prompts or 'do it yourself.' I normally use the prompt option, but find it quite convenient to go step-by-step to check my own work, as I can go instantly to any specific form and item number for review or correction. Turbo Tax is intuitive and very user friendly. Intuit utilizes the highest level of security algorithms available in processing all tax returns for online routing, transferring, and review. I've never encountered any problem in this area (having been with time since they first released their product). Their guarantees are ironclad and I have full faith and confidence in this regard. I was unable to answer a tax question I had and went to the IRS web page... It failed and referred me to the IRS Customer Service number. I was absolutely astounded when told by the IRS representative, "We do not have a staff person available to answer your specific question, please go to our website." It accomplished nothing to advise this person that it was their own website that told me to call them. She simply repeated her statement. Rejected and with $26K in the balance, I called Intuit Customer Service. A tax expert employed by them returned my call and in less than three minutes had me accomplish an update that came out after release of that year's Turbo Tax that I was unaware of. I was able to properly account for my charitable contribution and reap the quite generous tax refund I was entitled to! I will NEVER leave Intuit Turbo Tax!
The help files are NOT accurate because they are verbatim from the IRS books and do not address the SOFTWARE issues. I am not the only consumer who looks to their help files for help with their SOFTWARE, but they give almost no help in the software. Therefore, the software cannot be accurate because the user does not know if the software was accurately used for the specific question they didn't answer. Even the telephone technical support people have been of no help. Twice now I have paid to have H&R Block do my taxes because of insufficient help in this software's help files AND unknowledgeable technical support people. Relatively easy with the step-by-step instructions, but many of the questions give no indication that a later question/page will want you to exclude a subtotal from the earlier page. Therefore, I have had to go back, deduct the amount, then put it in the subsequent page. It seems too easy for email to be trapped or lost. There is no telephone method (even if it is automated) to get a personal ID number. TWICE, I called Intuit's technical support for SOFTWARE help. TWICE I was told I had to contact the other people for TAX SUPPORT. I told them - both times - that I KNOW the TAX information, I just need to know how to get it into your software. They BOTH insisted I call the tax support people. And BOTH TIMES, the TAX people said they cannot help me because it is a SOFTWARE support question... and I got no help, wasted two plus hours, and just paid H&R Block to do my taxes. As far as I am concerned, I merely wasted my money getting TurboTax software. Ultimately, I gave the software to my niece who filed a 1040EZ (i.e. no questions, just fill-in-the-blank) because she wanted a typed copy to send instead of handwriting it, which she was fully aware of how to do WITHOUT the software.
My daughter is a forensic accountant and I did not want to bother her with my "simple" taxes. I used TurboTax Premier and she said it was 75% to 80% accurate. She could have easily found me more deductions. Did not really go into items where I could have gotten deductions. I had to know how to calculate many things that TurboTax should have computed for me. On unusual tax items had to contact Intuit for assistance - this was a nightmare. Spoke with 3 representative until connected to someone that was able to assist me. Hope the security is good. I believe my Apple computer has good security, do not know from Intuit's end. Bought Intuit TurboTax Premier from BJ's for $55.00. My daughter is an accountant and said that for a simple tax return an accountant gets $125.00. TurboTax Premier was not totally user friendly, do not know about security. Customer service was horrendous.
Able to get a brief explanation of the tax law. I understand they have someone adding the tax briefs but they are not in-depth. It is like paying for a luxury car but only getting Honda. There two modes where they guide you or manual. You review what you want and the software chimes in where needed. I have used this software for years and feel it has gotten more complicated over the years. They have had some security breaks but who has not. Security of information is not high on corporate America list. I have worked for the IRS and every year during our yearly tax update, HR Block was on the watch list including other tax companies. Never once was TurboTax discussed. Having worked in the tax industry - I feel TurboTax is one of the better ones. You do have to read the tax briefs because it will allow you to file items you are not allowed.
Common schedules not available, difficult to override the system. Zero support available except in chat rooms from other clueless taxpayers. Software would be adequate if there was even rudimentary customer service. In the past Turbotax processed my refund promptly. However, this year I had to use the Taxpayer Advocate to track down my return. Still have not received it from TurboTax. Today alone I have been on three separate 45-minute holds because there is no way to reach customer service or track down the missing money. Never had good customer service, now it's non-existent. No customer service so no way to get questions answered accurately. Horrible, as far as I can tell they have no tracking software. I'm in the process of taking them to court to get my refund, which the IRS sent to Green Dot bank over a week ago.
I had some complicated investments profits and losses but when I called TurboTax customer service for help their representative walked me through the various entries, and spent almost an hour on the phone with me at no additional charges. Saves me many hours trying to compute the right numbers and entering them in the correct places. The questions guide you through the information needed on the forms and vastly simplify complicated instructions. Once you initially set up an account (for free) and choose a strong password you can securely access your records year after year. I have used TurboTax exclusively for many years, since it was only available on disk, and now available online. I find that even as the tax code becomes more complex, TurboTax's software becomes easier to use.
I have no reason to think it's not accurate. I have a home business so I use the Home & Office version. I started using it 2 years ago. That year and last year they had a deal where up to $9,000 of refund could be taken in the form of an Amazon gift card for 110% of the amount. The 10% bonus far exceeded the cost of the software, so in effect they were paying me to use it. This year they no longer offer the Amazon option. Since they already had my data from last year, which minimizes data entry, and since I was used to the software, I figured it was worth paying for. Otherwise I would have explored other options. Some of their instructions on what to enter could have been clearer but all in all it was pretty clear. I haven't had any problems with security (knock on wood).
Have used TurboTax for more than 35 years except for the one year it would not load to Windows version I had. Have never experienced an error on either mine or any family member's return. The value has dropped as they cut the number of e-filings allowed while continuing to raise the price, on the premier version. Ease of use is good, but questions not always easily answered when it comes to rental property and IRAs. Stocks have not presented unusual problems. Always check encryption lock prior to transmission. The rest I must print out and ask family members to snail mail, so have experienced no security issue. Reconsider limits on the number of times e-files can be used. Not all families are limited to three filers.
Difficult to know exactly where the problems occurred because little is visible on the computations. TurboTax had me paying far more tax than H&R Block and compared to previous years. TurboTax reduced the features for 2014 while call the product the same and pricing it the same as previous years. It isn't hard to use. The results are just wrong! Read where TurboTax had been hacked. We had used it in previous years and then suffered ID problems. Someone had already gotten a refund using one of our SSNs. TurboTax sent an email promising a $25 refund if we purchase the 2014 product. We did. They denied our refund when we tried to get it.
I have never found a problem that they had not fixed and never (well lets not jinx it) :-)). It is overpriced. Each year the same product lacks less features causing the user to buy the higher priced version (Deluxe --> Premium for example). Having the ability to have the corporation input the data instead of me hand entering it is a very big plus. Navigate could be a lot better, but it is doable. Never had a problem that I am aware of to affect me. I do wished that Intuit had not purchased Tax Edge and then folded most of it into TT. Tax Edge had done very well with their software. Most of TT is from Tax Edge.
Sometimes confusing where some info should go. Costs to file. Pretty good for taxes. Seems fine. Like using but very, very upset about how to pay for state filing. Very sneaky to charge $39.99 to pay for efile from refund. What is this?? I have to pay for efiling? I tried to use credit card but continuously got error that the site was unavailable so I have to call. I called and it took 25 minutes to get through, then I have to give serial numbers and get codes and back for forth for another 10 minutes JUST TO PAY! Really is this worth it!? Left a very bad feeling about trickery by Turbotax.
Ease of use, simple questions. Cheap, affordable. Everything's laid out for you. Never had any problems with security. Secure but Intuit are greedy underhanding slimeballs for making you pay for something you didn't ask for. They advertise free but without your consent or knowing stick you with 40 dollar charge for audit alert membership with another business that you didn't not ask for or want. But you had no choice if you wanted to file your taxes electronically or start over. Just another greedy company who don't care for their customers just their investors.
Contains all pertinent forms and schedules. Correctly asked for and applied LEO retirement exemption. Compares favorably with tax services. Simply answer questions. A little bit cumbersome to return to a specific form or line, though. Returns securely and successfully transmitted. A major flaw in last year's business return software was the inability to electronically file a State return as required by State Law. TurboTax did not disclose this prior to my purchasing the software and did not provide this service until the 11th hour, 59th minute of the return being due.
It does not know your specific situations and it cannot ask questions you have only in a format of form numbers. Saves time, does give information regarding errors and just points out what you owe and not what they owe you. Easy for anyone who understands the languages available. Very good and it does not matter where you log on from any device. It remembers only certain specifications of your prior year return. You need to research your specific needs in order to get the help you need.
I can't make sense why I paid almost $6,000.00 in taxes (including property taxes) and only get a return of $1,600.00 including my State tax! The SSL (Secure Socket Layer) protects the information herein. Some of the instructions can be confusing, for example, I could not find a block where I could enter information about the Form 1095-B.
They download my investment information directly from Vanguard. The cost is a fraction of what I used to pay an accountant to use the same software. They auto fill all the information from the previous year so it saves a lot of time. They have added more safety steps in the process to prevent the problem they had last year. I have been using them for ten years and my CPA used them prior to that and I have never had an issue.
TurboTax has issues in 2016 with allowing you to use a Mac computer to run the program. It would not take payment for the state e-filing "because we were using a Mac computer"! The first time I called, I was put on hold for 2 hours and 20 minutes and was transferred a total of 4 times. Finally got through and got a code to enter. Then I called for my second filing for my daughter's taxes and they tried to have me pay more than the $19.99 fee because they didn't have the correct code. Put on hold again, person helping me was extremely rude - (Vanita), said I could pay the higher amount or she would put me on hold to see if she could find someone that knew the right code. No one ever returned to the call. I will never use TurboTax again.
Be careful when paying Intuit for the TurboTax service. When you are ready to file notice that the MAX Assist & Defend option is the default setting and if you miss that and then click the next button to pay you will be charged an additional fee of $59.99. My total was $184.05 for the Home and Business plus the state version. In five seconds, I realized I made a mistake but to no avail, Intuit had my money and appeals did not work and were a waste of time. This is the Intuit policy: "Once you've confirmed and paid for the service, we are unable to offer a refund." The payment step is one of two places in the entire software package that cannot be corrected. For most people MAX Assist & Defend is not needed and a waste of money. Intuit got an extra $60 from me but in the process but lost my trust and my willingness to recommend their service. I have used the TurboTax service since 1994 when Intuit acquired Parsons Technology for $64 million.
I have been a TurboTax user for years and have always been pleased. Easy features, pulls prior year info over, etc. Well this year I had many deductions so purchased the upgraded additions, offered the option to deduct it from my return, bonus easy enough! Then at time of filing that was an additional charge for this service. OK, anything not to put my credit card info online. Well here is where the trauma/drama begins. TurboTax uses a 3rd party and made the mistake of not reading every word of their disclosure. When my info from last year pulled over, it dropped the last 3 digits off my account number. As of today 2/23/2016 Santa Barbara Tax Preparer Group has had my refund for over two weeks and will not release it. After uploaded them my drivers license twice, verifying they have it they are now requesting I fax my drivers license. I have found hundreds of other having the same issues.
I've been using TurboTax for many years. I've never had an issue until now. This is my first year having them take the fees out of my refund. What a mistake! I went through the whole process of doing my Federal and State. Get all the way through the process and it tells me I can't E-file my state and I have to mail it in. Then I have to wait 6 wks for a refund! I don't want to wait 6 weeks and after spending a lot of time late at night on a Friday night, I was tired and just figured I'd contact them Monday when they are open. No biggie right? So, come to find out, the issue is TurboTax didn't get the business code on the 1040 right. My Federal shouldn't even been submitted seeing as that right there raises my chances of getting audited. It was a simple fix BUT there was no way for me to fix this. It wouldn't let me change the code on the State taxes either! So, forget it, I just went on my state's website and redid my state taxes with the proper code. E-file accepted! FOR FREE! Now TurboTax should refund my state fees 34.99! They absolutely refuse since I submitted everything. With any NORMAL company we are allowed to cancel our order and receive a refund if the product is not what we wanted. NOT THEM! If I used PayPal or a credit card I would've gotten a refund but again TurboTax refused and then the customer service rep was completely argumentative. Then the supposed President calls me and she was just as ignorant and argumentative. So that's fine. I will make sure I NEVER use this company for anything ever again. Neither will my husband or my 2 children. They chose to lose 4 customers over a lousy 34.99. I also put a post on Facebook and there's another 400 people that saw my post. Not to mention the people they told! What a horrible money hungry company!
I have used TurboTax several times before. Thus far this year, our return has been rejected 8 - you see that, 8 times. First it was the wrong PIN for me. Funny... I wrote it down as it showed up on the screen. Then it was my husband's PIN they said was wrong. Next, they said since I put my name first instead of his they couldn't take it since last year his name was first. (WTH?) Then they said it had been accepted and since it was accepted with my name first they couldn't fix it. I spent half an hour last night with a rep and she ended up telling me to wait till this morning "to let the system catch up". Well, no change today. I'm still on hold since the customer service rep can't figure out what's going on. Yeah, I could do her job as well as she does for all the help I've been given so far. I've wasted $67 and now it looks like I'm going to have to file via snail mail and wait the 6-12 weeks I didn't want to wait this year since we need the money we're getting back. What a crock. I will never patronize TurboTax again. They take your money quickly enough but if there's a problem you're out of luck. I wouldn't recommend them to anyone!
Filed my 2015 return. Yesterday 3 weeks later I receive a letter from the IRS saying that they needed form 2651 which should have been sent when I filed. I called TurboTax yesterday. After 2 hours on the phone they sent me to another group (Tax Analyst). This morning I get this from them "I am sorry but I am not sure what the issue is. Accuracy Guarantee claims are for when and if you receive a letter from the IRS in which you were audited and incurred penalties/or interest charges. Have you received such a letter that shows penalties incurred?" In the email there is no contact info to help me get this resolved. So I had to start at square 1 again. Called again. Told them that the customer service from yesterday sent me to another group with a new number and they closed out my issue. After all was said and done. The new customer service agent was able to get me my forms easily. My concern with Turbo Tax is that their software is not sending out the needed forms to the IRS. They should have sent the 6251 form in my case due to the chance of me having to pay AMT tax. Turbo Tax software did not. Then when informing their customer service of the glitch they did nothing to resolve the problem, just helped me get the forms they should have sent in the first place.
Like other posts I've seen, I feel swindled by the Intuit packaging gimmicks. I bought a bundled version of Turbotax Deluxe and Quicken 2016. I don't have complicated taxes. I bought the deluxe version because it supposed to come with State taxes. I was extremely disappointed to discover that the bundled Deluxe version I bought does NOT include State tax preparation. I have download that and pay an extra $40. I must say, it is a very well played Bait & Switch tactic with the name and packaging. You have to look at the boxes and descriptions very closely to see the switch between the regular and the bundled version. Maybe next year I'll just download the forms and do everything by hand again.
Filed my taxes with TT as I have done for the last 12 years (without incident). Received an email from TT stating, "Your refund is on its way. You will see your direct deposit within the next business day". 4 days later = NOTHING. Contact the IRS whom states my refund has been funded (3 days ago). Contacted SBTPG based on the information in the email from TT. I was routed to 3 different 800 #'s via an automated system. To finally get my call dropped 3 times and then to sit on hold for over 2.5 hours with no one ever picking up the call. Went online to TT to see who SBTPG was and if others had issues with this organization. I found a link to the SBTPG website in which I logged in providing my SS#, refund amount and filing status. It then prompts a pop up message that says "Due to suspicious activity your account has been put on hold. Fax a copy of your driver's license/passport and we will review your documents within 7 business day". Whaaat? My "account"? I don't even know who these people are and you want me to fax what? Where? So, I contacted TT this AM for the agent to tell me she had no idea whom SBTPG was and this appeared to be very suspicious as they do not show my account being ever being put on hold. After almost an hour and her supervisor stepping in they tell me this appears to be the Santa Barbara bank. They have nothing to do with this issue and that I need to try and contact them really? "Isn't this your vendor," I ask. They reply, "yes." "So, ME (your customer) has to contact YOUR vendor to find out why my refund hasn't been deposited as YOU stated it would be?" She then proceeds to tell me that since my refund is so large there are controls to verify identities to prevent fraudulent claims. Hmmmmm. So the ONLY fraudulent activity in my mind at this point is the fact that the IRS funded my refund 4 days ago (as of today). The TT vendor SBTPG has my refund and now for potentially another 7 business days as they "verify my identity"? This from a customer that has used TT for 12 years, depositing my refunds into the same bank account? And, why wasn't this verification done prior to the IRS funding my refund. Who's making money here? Can you say - FRAUD!!! Very disappointed with TT as they just lost a very faithful customer.
I have been using TurboTax for a number of years. This year I did my return using their Deluxe version. I completed both returns without any issues and filed both state and federal without any apparent problems other than constantly being bombarded for upgrades that I did not need. Both returns were accepted promptly. I received my stated refund in about 10 days. I kept checking on my federal return and after 4 weeks was finally notified that my federal refund check was being mailed to me next week. What the Heck - I had completed my return requesting Direct Deposit which I got on my state return. I printed a hard copy of my Federal Return and there "x"s through all account and routing numbers. After a little research I discovered this was a big problem with TurboTax in 2014 and I guess it carried over. Several calls to Customer Service failed to resolve the issue. They were rude, incompetent and a total waste of time (They deserve less than 1 star). At this point it would have been quicker to file a paper return through snail mail. I will be using someone other than TurboTax next year!
We are not sure what happened because tax support absolutely refused to help us or answer any of our questions, but we received an alarming email from TurboTax stating that our account had been accessed from a computer in California. It went on to say... "If this doesn't sound right please contact us." That's exactly what we did, but the man must not have understood, but I can't speak for his mind, but he didn't respond the way someone who understood would. He just kept trying to sell us a security package. My husband said "No thanks. You guys texted us so what's the problem?" The man became irate and hung up the phone! Needless to say this highly alarmed me because for all I know he could be the one trying to steal our taxes! So I called back and he also got rude with me. I told him he has to tell us who accessed our account because that's his job, and he told me to shut the ** up! I told him I'm calling the FTC, but it's late Friday and now I'm just stuck wondering if someone stole my money! Completely unprofessional and incompetent! Is it even legal for a business to do that when it comes to the IRS? This is a sensitive area to be playing with people’s money!!!
My wife and I did our 2014 taxes with them last year and it work out so we decided to do 2015 as well. We used their website and as we finished up we noted the price which was supposed to be free. It started at 34.99 which we were ok with and then they add another 36.99 for state tax filing. At that point we just decided to pay it and wanted it to come out of refund. Then they were trying to auto tack on another 39.99 for "TurboTax Premium Bundle Services With Refund Transfer"! Total became $111 and some change... We found out that was the transfer fee for paying with the refund. We unchecked that box and instead decided to pay with a debit card. It wasn't on the summary but we ended up getting charged for it anyway. I called and was on hold about 20 or more minutes. After speaking to level 1, I finally got a supervisor and he outright refused to refund it saying it was our mistake. He refused to let me speak to their advisors. If I wanted to pay that extra fee I most certainly would have used the refund to pay it. What an awful experience with their terrible services. I will not use them in the future.
I purchased Intuit Turbo Tax Premier Disc edition and installed it on my Apple Mac with the latest operating system. Turbo Tax Premier presented problems with my state filing. I was unable to file my federal taxes and had the rejected multiple times because Intuit recognizes a five digit electronic filing pin code and IRS sent me a six digit IP Pin code. Even upon my obtaining a five digit code my federal forms were rejected for electronic filing. I got an assist number from Turbo Tax and phoned many times providing my information with no return calls. When I spoke with a representative about my problems with state filing they were courteous, but not helpful. If my daughter were not an accountant and able to correct the problems and have me file by mail because Turbo Tax would not enable me to file electronically, my problem would not have been resolved. IRS is aware of the problem and advised me that Turbo Tax should have been able to assist me.
After using TurboTax for a number of years and preparing the return, as usual, I discovered that because my entire 2015 income came from Social Security, no federal or state filing is required. TurboTax still billed me $29.99 for doing nothing. After trying several phone numbers, all of which either no longer respond, or are disconnected, I eventually reached a Tech support representative. He promised I would receive a refund and it would appear on my bank statement. This never happened. After using my online bank statement, I was able to find a Customer Support number. I was told they would call me back, which never happened. Whether I need to ever do a future filing, TurboTax will never again get my business.
I filed using the free file 2015 edition of Intuit TurboTax for my taxes this year. It is essentially just a portal to try and sell you on their other products. It is an extremely drawn out process with constant attempts to sell you on the "upgrades". The worst part was when I tried to access my previous returns it would not even let me pay to get the plus edition. The help center was awful and kept running me in circles to the same options which it would subsequently not let me choose. Do yourself a favor and use one of the other various free tax services. Tax Slayer allowed me to access my previous returns at no cost and hassle free.
I have been using Turbo Tax free addition for at least 15 years without any problems until last year. Our tax situation has been the exact same for the last 10-12 years. They tried to stick it to me last year with their fees at the end, but I called and got them waved. I've seen at least 50 Ads on TV the last few weeks from Turbo Tax claiming to file for free, and we mean "0". Well folks you better hold on to your wallet because like a fool I started my return online 2 days ago and they have already tried to hose me out of 69.98 for an upgrade to Deluxe edition and for E-file. I DON'T THINK SO!! I would rather pay a local tax guy 500.00 before I will give these crooks one red cent. People save yourself some time, aggravation and money and find another place to get you taxes done. I'm done with Intuit my bank account. Peace out.
Tim customer Service was very rude to me. He could not download the product on my desktop because he said I have 3 accounts. I asked can you please help me and consolidated this accounts or create a new one so I can have my desktop downloaded? He refused. I asked for his supervisor's name. He said is Arlene but she was gone for the day. I called 1-888-777-3066 at 6:20. Was on the phone for 20 minutes and my issue was not resolved. I ended up paying $15.00 to have express ship to me. TurboTax should reimburse the extra $15 I spend because of their inefficiency to help me with a desktop download. I am very upset. I've been a faithful TurboTax Customer since I can remember well, I am going to your competitor next year. Thanks for nothing. I am not adding a receipt because my credit card got charged twice for the same transaction and it all happened over the phone. I paid 159 twice for a 2013 business TurboTax software. I DEMAND A REIMBURSEMENT.
After using TurboTax for 18 or more years with no issues, I now find myself very unhappy about trying to print my returns offline to have hard copies for my records. It seems there is a riff between Apple and Intuit regarding protected library print codes beginning back in 2014 as stated by a Forbes article in a Google search. Is anyone else having problems printing hard copy returns using Turbo Deluxe from their Mac? It has become a real headache for myself and family for we need copies for mailing in returns and other reasons. I no longer feel Turbo is right for me after being happy for all these years. I hope a fix can be done before I switch.
TurboTax: When I log into your website, all I want to do is buy and download your software for 2015. Why are you making it so hard to BUY your software? I don't want to start it online.
I've been filing tax returns via TurboTax online services for over 10 years. I file my own and help 7-10 others every year. This year, my 22 year-old niece filed for the first time. Brand new account created with her email, etc. Near the end of the filing, the system deleted the entire return. She redid the entire return and filed successfully. She deposited the refund into her mother's savings account. Her mother logged into TurboTax today to file, and her information was deleted. A completely separate account - now contains her daughter's return. Two accounts, both link to her daughter's return. TurboTax blamed the user until they had to admit otherwise. 2 hrs on the phone. Zero answers. Never again. I've heard more excuses and absolutely no accountability. They have a serious programming or data linking error.
I filed my taxes with TurboTax because it said I could file free Federal and State. I always do a 1040EZ but it claimed I needed the full 1040 so it wasn't free. First they charged me for the filing federal (29.99), then another $36.99 for the State taxes and $34.99 to take the first 2 fees out of the Federal Return and pass through their bank. In the end, they filed a 1040EZ! What a Rip-Off! You lost me as a customer!
This was the first year my husband and I filed jointly on together. My husband has been a frequent TurboTax user and has never had any complaints until this year. We filled out our taxes on January 20th, 2016 and everything went through smoothly, up until we went past our 21-day waiting period for our taxes. Everything was cut and dry, nothing too fancy. We had to call the IRS to find out what was going on with our taxes. After waiting a week and a half for a mailed letter from them it stated that we never typed in a 1095-A form. Now I was on Obamacare Marketplace insurance for a couple months when I left work and my husband had his own insurance paid through his company (getting a family plan through his work would have been too much to pay into). TurboTax never asked him ANY information regarding MY health insurances that I may have had or carried. Now the letter from the IRS states that we have to fill out our own premium tax credit form and send it back with the changed information on the 1040 (they want you to do your own calculations). Well long story short, besides having to wait even longer for our taxes, we now have lost out on some money we thought we were getting because TurboTax never asked us any of this information. We will be taking our services elsewhere from now on.
I have been a customer of TurboTax Online for 20 years. For the last two years I have used their partnership with Amazon to receive a 10% bonus on my federal tax refund by applying it directly to an Amazon gift card. This year I was planning to do the same and could not find the option. It wasn't until after I clicked through the credit card payment process that I discovered it was no longer offered. I did not use TurboTax to file my taxes and instead used H&R Block as they are now offering the 10% Amazon bonus. Not only would TurboTax not refund my money, the manager I spoke to was incredibly rude and dismissive. I will never return.
All the advertising I have seen says free State and Federal. Well, Hello!!! Until you go into the site you have no idea that there are many costs. Once you start the return you realize that there are many exceptions and you have been conned. Turbo should cease and desist with their con job lies. The charges are there and they are high!!!
I paid for Turbo Tax Deluxe Edition, filed Federal Taxes and could not file State taxes, the desktop program does not even have information on how to file state by mail, you can only do one state tax return, there are glitches and updates all the time. The desktop app does not synchronize with the website. If you were looking at the convenience of looking up your status or continue your tax input from mobile devices, not really an option as you will have a duplicate file. Long story short, I called for some basic questions on my taxes. The rep is definitely not a tax expert and did not even know what I was talking about, she was not a tech expert either because she couldn't help me solve the technical problems with the program. As I was with her on the phone for over an hour, I got really frustrated and began to distrust the company and all their business practices. Basically, what you can do with them having to pay, most other companies do it for free. If you can, avoid. After she kept pushing for up-selling me other "states" offering a 20% discount, I actually asked for a refund instead being that the product did not work for me as intended or described. After I was on hold for another 5 minutes, she came back to say she could refund 20% of the original price. They can keep their twenty percent. They will need it when they start losing all their customers. Just check the consumer affairs review website and read the complaints of people. This company does not even have the intention to help.
When the personal questions were asked, I checked self-employed. When I started answering questions concerning my business I received a response saying my cost would be more. Again, when I filled in my information my cost rose. I will probably not continue using this site and go to TAXACT with no cost. I do see that many complaints do involve self-employed business issues.
I have used TurboTax since they came out with it. I would say for 15 to twenty years now. I went to file my taxes this year and was charged for the premium service. They charged me 40 dollars for something I didn't ask for and didn't want. There was no way to get out of it. Pay it or don't file. How low can these people go to get that extra penny out of us? Then they wonder why a guy like Donald Trump is winning. People are tired of getting ripped off. This is the last year for me. I'd rather go back to the old way or pay someone else to do it for me. Shame on you Intuit. (Greedy, greedy, greedy.)
I am a customer of TurboTax Premier for 7 years. This year I noticed that Turbo Tax did not alert me on a deduction I should have taken every year. I tried to enter it this year and the calculations are off or not calculated at all. Since the two first representatives could not help me, I was transferred for the second time and I have been waiting for 1:30 min, after waiting 40 min for the first person to answer. It is ridiculous that being such a big company they treat customers in this manner. I asked the last representative if someone could call me instead of have me waiting and she said no. I also asked, "in case get disconnected, can I get a direct line phone number?" She said no. I would have to call back and start all over again. I have been on the line for 2 hours and 32 min. Still no answer.
I have used TurboTax - the web version - to e-file for approximately 4 or 5 years. Normally, it was just an overpriced way to e-file and itemize deductions. But I stuck with it because it was a one-stop shop with all of my info already there. However, as my taxes got more complex, TurboTax became impossible to deal with. The system makes mistakes, charges you upwards of $155 for e-filing (Federal and two states) only to advise that the Federal return -- and, subsequently, state returns -- cannot be e-filed and will have to be amended. Once amended, they are ineligible for e-file. Yet, the high charge remains... 7 unsuccessful attempts to contact someone who can help. One very long conversation with an incompetent rep who kept asking what browsers I was using and then kept transferring me somewhere where no one picked up. And... I am left with 40+ printed out pages that I have to sort through, figure out what goes where, pay for postage and then wait 6-12 weeks to have them processed. For nearly $155. Absolutely will never ever use them.
I created an account two weeks ago then logged off. Now I can't get back in. I tried creating a new password and now I am locked out of my account. I called their customer number and got a robot who was not reading the information I was putting in. I finally got it to transfer me to a human and they said it would be an hour wait time. Someone is supposed to call me back. This has been going on for three days and I need to finish this up and get on with my life.
I have filed with TurboTax for now 9 years since I started filing in 07. This year they charged me twice for the deluxe edition. Okay I will pay it this time, not next year because I wasn't aware of the extra charge this year. So I filed on 1/27/16 and was accepted 30 minutes later. I was given January 28 - Feb 17 for a time frame. No big deal, usually get my refunds within 2 weeks. Well the only thing I did differently this year was file using TT Deluxe Edition as compared to the Free Edition. Now here it is Feb 11 (15 days) and the next batch for the 2/16 Direct Deposit Date came out AND I DIDN'T EVEN MAKE THAT. First time I ever file using the Deluxe Edition with TurboTax and magically I get randomly selected for Review. WTH? Except for a change of jobs and address, nothing was any different than the previous years other than filing method. And calling IRS or Customer Support with Intuit is like bashing my head through a wall, realizing it hurts and then doing it again. Neither one of them is helpful in the slightest. Won't tell me if I have to ID. Verify nothing.
We have been using TurboTax Deluxe (CD or online download) since the 90s and have been very happy with the product until this year. This year we purchased the CD format and have been very unhappy. The updates had to be done manually and we had to file our state tax using the state site because TurboTax would not download the forms. We paid for state returns and did not receive the product so we are very dissatisfied. We will give the software another try next year because we have had no problems in the past. Hopefully it will go back to being a product we can trust.
Some evil dumbass was able to obtain my e-mail address and hack into my turbo-tax and file. I just can't trust that this won't happen again especially since I am one of the many people affected.
I have always used TurboTax free edition. This year I decided I would pay the 29.99 to file to support them. I filled in all the forms answered all the stupid questions and finally came time to efile. Before I could efile they wanted me to agree to pay an additional 34.99 to set up an account in my name. Nowhere did it say I would be charged this fee to pay the 30 dollars from my tax return. When I chose the cancel it said it would erase all my info and I would have to start over from the beginning. I had just spent an hour on my taxes and didn't want to start over. If they had put on the pay with your return about the 34.99 I wouldn't have been upset and probably would have still chose that option, but the fact that nothing is said until the end after you are all done is kinda scandalous if you ask me. Like they were hiding the fee because they wanted to trap people into paying it or starting over from scratch. This is just poor business. I used to tell everyone I know to use their service. Not anymore. I will tell everyone I know to go elsewhere next year as well as myself. I have used them since 2007 but not anymore. Time to find someone else to use.
Called because unable to download state software and was on hold for over an hour and the assistant picked up phone and told me to hold once again and then after 25 min hung up on me. Their own message on their software said to call this number for resolution and still have no resolution.
I have used Turbotax for YEARS. This year they have changed it. I have always used the Standard version as a self-employed person. Now, they make you buy the Home Office version for DOUBLE the money. I have called the supposed "support line" after an hour of speaking to people with very poor communication skills, using all the customer service clichés of "Sorry for the Inconvenience." They could explain nothing. When I said I would but a different product their comment was buy the standard, and if you have to upgrade it will ask you and you can pay the difference at the time.
TurboTax says state filing is $19.95, but when I got to the final e-filing stage they tacked on a $34.95 service charge. When I tried to back that out, they locked me into the e-filing and now I'm on hold for 75 minutes waiting for the secret to releasing my tax information so I can manually file. I'm switching to a company that doesn't try to trick me after the fact. I'll never use them again.
I paid for a version of their software that included CPA and Tax Support. When I contacted customer service, twice, I got disconnected twice. There is no direct number to CPA support. They make you contact the main number and when you are transferred, you are disconnected. I think this is intentional. TurboTax makes it as difficult as possible to fulfill their advertised obligation.
Every year we choose to send hard copies to the state because they always charge to electronically submit taxes. Turbo Tax can't seem to keep up with states because they have no way for you to electronically enter your information for direct deposit if you manually submit your taxes. In addition, it seemed impossible to get a hold of anyone at TurboTax to discuss what to do to keep the state from automatically generating a check!
I had a 1099-MISC. They took 28% off my 1099 when it should only be 15.3 and once clearing the information I tried again and they took 38% off on top of making you agree to pay $35 to even be able to do a 1099. They became money hungry over the past yr!
I started doing my taxes with Turbo Tax free edition, but wasn't able to finish without upgrading. I am a truck driver and had some deductions, so I had to go with the deluxe version in order to actually deduct my expenses. The price for the deluxe version was $34.99, so I decided to check out H&R, which was only $9.99 and gave me the exact same tax refund. H&R was very user friendly and didn't ask some of the stupid questions that turbo tax asks.
BEWARE!!! This tax option is easy to use but tries to DOUBLE THEIR FEE at the end without you noticing. It tells you the cost is $34.99, and then All of a SUDDEN!!!... You're being charged $70. It's $34.99 for the taxes and then another $34.99 for TurboTax to OPEN an ACCOUNT to deduct your payment from? You've got to be KIDDING ME! I've used TurboTax before and never got charged this fee... They tried to sneak it in there this year and I think that's pretty Crappy and SHADY!! Especially to all the loyal customers out there. ** TurboTax... PS you can avoid this fee if you pay by credit card. It only charges you this if you choose to deduct it from your refund. Have used TurboTax for many years without issue... until they tried to steal an extra $34.99 from me this year. At the end, after filing, I was asked to post a review and wrote honestly about what I thought. MY REVIEW WAS BLOCKED!!! They wouldn't post it for "inappropriate content" even though no curse words, etc, were used. I guess you can only review them if you say good things... Take about DISHONEST and BIASED to the MAX!!!
I had 2 W-2s and entered both. Took all my information, however when I thought I was at the point to e-file I only saw one W-2 information and amount. I tried reaching TurboTax, waited 4 hours and now I contacted another Professional tax preparation service and they say this is common with TurboTax and have to wait once again to amend my taxes. I don't get how the software was working. I followed all the steps and entered all correctly. I feel this is a way for TurboTax to get people to pay for the FREE service they offer... NEVER AGAIN will I use or refer anyone to TURBOTAX. Horrible experience...
I filled in my Federal and State Tax using turbo tax 2015 free addition. I was careful NEVER to accept any of the turbo tax sneaky upgrades. It was a simple form and I owed no taxes, but when it came to filing my taxes... TurboTax demanded that I pay for $71.98 for e-filing my return and there was no way to get out of it! I called and 45 minutes later I got a return call from a young lady named Megan. She stated that I must have upgraded the product when I filled in the form and the only way I could get the free form was to clear out all the info I entered and start over. I thanked her and cleared all my data!! Headed elsewhere to do my taxes! DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY ON TURBOTAX! PERIOD!
I finally reached a reasonable customer service representative who allowed me back into my account. But it should not have been this difficult, especially for a loyal long term customer.
In 2015, I got a notice that I owed the IRS more than $1,000 for the tax year 2013. I had filed with TurboTax. Although they have the information to get into my 401K and say they can pull all necessary information out of it, they did not. I had to get help from my account manager in order to file an amended return and pay the tax and penalties. TurboTax did not help with that payment. This year, I decided to try again but as soon as I got started, I could see that they had my 2014 federal and state refund information wrong. I had to dig out last year's returns and correct that information. Very untrustworthy for the price I would say.
I redid the return. It was short and easy to do. The new return worked correctly so the problem may have been a corrupted file due to some other problem. Maybe they are not as creepy as I thought.
First of all when I filed my husband & my 2015 taxes TurboTax stated it was free, until it came time to E-file, then Turbotax made me pay $34.99. Even though I had no extra forms to file TurboTax site would not let me file without paying. Secondly I was helping my daughter's boyfriend file his 2015 EZ form. TurboTax filing was free up until I went to E-file then it wanted $34.99, it would not let him file, I called Intuit/Turbotax and the representative said it shouldn't be charging, but couldn't do anything to help. So he logged off, went to TaxAct and filed his taxes for free, same info. TurboTax is unfair and should not be allowed to rip people off.
First off when you get your W2s they already have your refund amount... for state and federal. If you have more than 1 W2 add all state withheld tax amount to know exactly what you are getting, then add all state tax amount to know exactly what you are getting. Mailing them would be lot better than filing with Turbotax! I tried TurboTax all up until it said process... because they were trying to take at least 1400 of my money. Which is fraud because they claim it's a free service, but it's not. Don't use them ever! Again get your W2s from a local library for free! And fill them out. It's simple addition, and box checking. Mailing them in will take a little longer than a 72hr turn around, but at least you know the state will give you all your money you worked for!!!
Could have used H&R Block for free and gotten $117 more back. Instead, TurboTax charged me $34.99 to file a 1099 Misc and another $36.99 to file state taxes. After paying all of these fees, they calculated my return to be $117 less than H&R Block calculated it to be. I called to complain about this as they have a "maximum refund guaranteed" policy and they said they would refund me my state tax filing fee but have yet to do so.
I've spent over five hours on the phone on hold trying to get my money back. Rather than doing the right thing TurboTax beats people up with their long hold times till people just give up. I still have not gotten my money back from these scumbags.
The first year I used TurboTax was good, it was free like it advertises to be. I just filed my tax with them again and I can tell you I will look at other options next year. 34.99 to use TurboTax then another 34.99 to have YOUR tax money direct deposited or receive the credit card. What a ripoff. I'm DONE!
Downloaded TurboTax for 2015. Started inputting information, the program froze. Had to end task to get out of it. Reopened and it had saved some of the information I had input but not all. Did this three times then tried to contact customer support. This was the largest problem. I eventually talked to someone, explained the problem and they promptly put me on hold. I waited on hold ten minutes then tried to call back in. Each time was told by automated system that the wait time was 35 minutes and they would call me back. We'll see. I believe I will ask for a refund and use a different service.
I have used TurboTax in the past, when it was good. Now it's just a headache! They try and get you to upgrade at every chance they get! And when I try to contact support for these fees that I did not agree to they just keep you on hold then hang up on you! So very frustrating. STAY FAR AWAY FROM TURBOTAX!!!
Hidden fees, they are not telling you what you are going to pay until you hit submit, then most of the information is misleading. Had to get answers. It's expensive. I would not recommend anyone to use it. Too complicated. The value is not worth well. It needs to be cheaper for everyone to afford. It's not easy to follow, instruction are unclear. It take too long to prepare. Most of the information is usually missing, If you can't understand something there is no support. You have to pay extra for support. I was worried about security to my information. I was not sure if they are the only one have access to my information since it's online. You have no guarantee.
Very accurate. I'm not a tax preparer but I would imagine most inaccuracies are due to incorrect user input. It's very easy to use and understand. For the convenience of not having to deal with a cpa, the software was well worth the money. It's also a comprehensive product that made me feel good about the price I paid. Very easy to use. Clear prompts and it won't let you continue if there are errors or missing information. Very easy to use. User-friendly interface. I am unaware of the security of the software I used. I don't remember if it promoted a particular level or type of security. I suppose I assumed my info was safe because it was a local program.
I believe at this point it's pretty accurate; I guess I'll never know unless I take my taxes to get double checked. I believe it to be pretty accurate though. Cheaper than an accountant; however it started out as saying it is free and by the end of it I was paying $75 so that was a negative, but like I said- it's still cheaper. Asked easy questions to guide you; you can use the short list if you have nothing to itemize and/or use a longer list of deductions if your taxes are more complicated. Seems to be very secure; I have not had any issues thus far. I forgot my password and it was easy to retrieve it, but it would be hard if someone else would have tried.
Never had an issue with this product. Always been able to find out answers through its software. Makes sure when I check my account if it was accepted or not. If not helps me with the issues of why not accepted. Great value. For what these tax preparers charge this is the next best thing. I used to pay about $150 to $200 for a preparation. With this it's only one amount. Very easy to use. The questions have little side notes to make you understand what they are asking of you. Also never had a problem with the software. Never had an issue of my information being unguarded. I have been using it for the past 9 years and always safe. Never been let down. My information is secure.
Updates keep coming even after you already filed your taxes. Too hard to change items after you get to final step. Limited the amount of uses for program. They got money hungry and I for one won't be using this program again. Last year they cut back on how many uses and I had to do it the old fashion way. I only do my family's taxes. My daughter and son's and of course mine and my wife's. I really don't know about the security of this program (tax preparer). I have not been hacked because of this product at least.
I rate this in the middle because I really don't know how accurate this is. We, the consumers, do not have access to the forms and instructions to do this ourselves. If the forms were still out there, I would be filing the EZ form. My federal and state tax returns were filed for free, so this is definitely a great value. This preparer is so easy to use. You just follow the instructions to fill in the numbers from the boxes on the W-2's and answer questions to get you the most you can. I haven't had any problems that I'm aware of using this preparer. I have used this preparer for the last 4 years. There is the security lock at the top of the browser. So if you trust that, it is a safe website.
I assume it is accurate since I have nothing to compare it to. I don't take my tax forms for a second opinion. I always get the refunds they state. You can't beat FREE! Free Federal and a very small fee for the State. You have an option to pay a fee (or upgrade) if you want them to represent you in case of an audit by the IRS. It walks you through everything by asking you a lot of questions. If you are not sure how to do your taxes then don't skip any of the questions and you can't go wrong. I have never had any problems. They give you a security number to sign off with that only you can read. You do have to provide your Social Security # of course but I have never had any issues with this either.
I have used it for a long time and it has never made a mistake. It is easy to use and very helpful. It is easy to file electronically using TurboTax considering how much it cost to hire a person to do your taxes. It is a steal. At least less than half the cost of a human to do it. I like the fact that no one sees any of my personal information. It leads you through each and every step, in fact it is a little too simple. Sometimes I wish it was a little more sophisticated and acted like I actually was a smart person. They even lead you through the process of setting up your security ID. Then they never sell anything of yours, including when the government asked for personal information they declined.
Easy to use, step by step guide. I have used TurboTax for over 6 years without a problem or audit. I am very please with TurboTax and recommend it to anyone who doesn't want to sit in the front of a Walmart with a clerk. Although it may seem a little expensive, the process is easy and can be done at your leisure, saving your work and coming back later. The EFT is easy and fast. The process is easy and has many helpful tips. If I have a question, I know that I can call to get the additional help I need from their support staff. The security is as strong as I would imagine. I have never felt that my financial information was at risk. I trust TurboTax and am not worried that my sensitive material will be breached.
I have never had any issues with inaccuracy of this tax preparer in the 10 or so years I have been using TurboTax. I have used many different versions over the years and they have all been accurate, at least that I know of. It's much cheaper than going to an accountant to have taxes prepared. For about $75 you can prepare your own taxes at your leisure, so it's well worth the price. TurboTax is very easy to use. It has guided step by step screens. It takes you through each one of them. If something is required, it tells you something is required. I don't have an issue with the Security of this product or the company that makes it. I believe if there were any breaches in security they would be handled appropriately.
They get me more deductions than I could get on my own filing a paper form. Very quick, very easy, and you don't need to spend hours reading a bunch of instructions! Not too happy to have to spend a minimum of $34.99 ($69.98 if you don't pay with a credit card and instead choose to have fees deducted from your refund). You don't have to spend hours reading a bunch of instructions, just click through and it will ask you about all kinds of scenarios in order to get the biggest refund possible. Not really sure I know much about the security of TurboTax. I do know it's a little annoying to try to log in but require a code be sent either to my email or phone in order to do so, but I can understand why it might be necessary.
The site required numbers that simply were not defined well enough for me to find though I entered every number on the income statements, none "worked". As I could not get past the initial requirements, after wasting time with numerous tries, I eventually gave up in desperation. Therefore, any input beyond that point would not have any veracity.
Mostly accurate, but not so on relocation moving and reimbursement from employer and making changes with an amended one. But other that, I think pretty accurate as this past year I compared to H&R Block. Didn't like how for 2014 taxes, TurboTax took out the investment part from Deluxe without telling anyone. Due to customer backlash, they later added. Wish such backlashes happened on other products. TurboTax is very easy to use, granted, I've been using it for over 18 years and I like the interface. One reason I stayed with them, despite all the controversy last year is because H&R Block isn't as easy to use. I have no comments on security other than I've never been hacked from a tax perspective, so I presume it is secure, but I just don't know so.
I really like the fact that they save all my personal information from one year to the next which saves a lot of data entry. I have never had any comebacks or audits using this tax program. I feel that this tax program is all that is advertised. I have used other tax programs and have paid a lot more including private tax preparers. This tax program walks you through the process step by step, thus it's very easy to understand and use. As I said previously, they save my personal info thus it saves on entering the data over again, like address, Soc. Sec. numbers, etc. We have never had a security issue with this tax program. If there had been an issue I am sure that we would have found out immediately.
TurboTax is very user-friendly and walks you through every step of tax return preparation. They also rate your risk of being audited. I would suggest writing your passwords and PINs on your tax return so you know where to find them for the next year. Usually the deal is you get the Federal free but have to pay for your state return. If you forget something and have to amend your return it can be costly. It's easy enough to use but it still takes time because you need to read through all of the questions to make sure you don't miss anything. If it's a simple return the program is very easy to use. I've used this product for about 8 years and haven't had any problems. Using your debit card to pay at the pump for gas is far more risky. So far I haven't had any issues filing online.
I found TurboTax to be extremely accurate, with tools provided to recheck your form before finally filing. It also has all of the forms necessary for filing at your fingertips. I found this filing option to be profoundly better than paper filing. All of the forms and options for deductions are at your fingertips. This service is quite valuable for those with limited abilities as well as the astute, for going through the complicated process of tax filing. As stated before, the site is easy to use with all of the necessary filing documents at your fingertips. When using this site you are able to save your file. There is a security code from the IRS that must be used before the filing is complete. To this date I am unaware of any security issues. However, I feel that nothing is 100% SAFE.
Never been audited so it must be ok although mine is a fairly easy return. The software does take you through a recheck of the entire return before sending which is reassuring. I think it's terribly expensive for what it costs to purchase the software every year. Some of the local companies such as H&R Block offer less expensive preparation and I'm thinking it might be worth taking the time out of my day to go there to save some money. Pretty straightforward system. You are asked a series of questions. The program directs you to additional screens where you can file information to be inserted onto different forms and worksheets. I have never had a problem that I am aware of, with TurboTax security. It is a bit bothersome they do not REQUIRE you to change your password with each tax year however.
Manipulation of the data I input, combined with software included information for both state and federal, as well as additional data the software downloads is always extremely accurate and works for results that are in my favor. I believe the price paid for this software package is very fair. I do have concern that there is a new version every year, but believe it is a small price to pay to keep your information private. If you can use a computer and understand the english language you can use this software. Obviously there are those that cannot file their own returns, but with a minimal amount of knowledge you can prepare your own return. I rarely do work on the "internet" or in the "cloud" but have not hesitated with this software. I have never had any adverse issues with the security of this package.
I tried to file my taxes online w/ TurboTax. This was my second time using this program. There was a question on my tax form I did not understand. Someone was supposed to call me about the question, but never did. I had paid for the service & lost my $149.99 that I was charged. I will never use TurboTax again. Spent the money, but never got my taxes filed. I had to go to a tax preparer to get my form corrected. Not only did I pay TurboTax, but I had to spend another $150.00 to have my tax corrected. I hate TurboTax for the reasons I mentioned above. I had to pay first. My taxes never got filed through TurboTax. They kept my money & never completed my tax return. I have no answer to the security question. I just never got my taxes filed & it still cost me $149.99. I did not receive a refund from TurboTax.
When we first used this program, we also went to a tax 'specialist' who could NOT complete our tax filings as well as TurboTax. First, we were surprised but now, it's become a necessary tax tool! Its value is in the tax write-off! 100% deductible for tax prep. Can't get any better than that! Plus, we follow the IRS's suggestions/codes, to be sure we're completing our form legally and correctly. If I could follow the program, so should anyone else! It leads you but you provide the numbers and it does the math! Great set-up! I've told all of our friends how much better this program is, and certainly, less expensive than visiting an actual tax preparer! I believe it's as secure as can be. Direct connection to the IRS and the system delivers the tax return quickly, and we normally receive our notification within two weeks!
I have never had any issues with filing. Multiple checks are done by the software to ensure that the return is error free. The software is able to pull up past tax returns and fills in a lot of the information on the current tax return. I like this feature because it minimizes user entry error. The cost of the software is a bit on the high side. For me it is more of a cost versus benefit. I would rather spend a little bit more on purchasing software than rely on myself to go through the sometimes difficult to understand tax forms on my own. The instructions are easy to understand. TurboTax takes the complexity of tax return forms and simplifies them into easy to read instructions. I have never had any issues regarding security with e-filing. The software has done a good job of ensuring that my tax information is kept confidential.
Every year something comes up where I have to contact them and figure out how to use some aspect that led to errors in my return. Every year they update the old errors and make new ones. Can handle the most difficult of tax returns. For example, I get a federal employee disability 1099-R, which for years TurboTax had to do a workaround to get it to report properly. It wanted to put the income on the wrong line of the 1040. It has a step-by-step approach, which admittedly can be a pain sometimes when you aren't sure if your situation fits within the context of the question. It does simplify the tax return, though.
I don't feel that I'm receiving the most accurate return based upon confusing definitions given for most questions that I may encounter. Such as interest in student loans, capital gains and other complicated areas tie most people using program. I don't like spending money for questionable proper tax returns. This can happen even with a CPA but at least they have their signature on documents for IRS to go after with any errors. Same with state taxes. Find the whole process very time-consuming and always log out and go back to it at later time. Eventually become aggravated and call a certified public accountant because it makes me feel better about filing and getting better tax return. I don't trust any security. Always a risk when filing online. If the IRS has already been violated by cyber hackers why and how can these programs be trusted.
Biggest drawback is once you are signed on and locked in, then you lose some portability if you want to move your information into other programs without a big migration headache, Then all of the upsells and undisclosed fees that they wait until you have put all of your info into their propriety software, JUST do the research before you sign on with any tax preparer program. If you want to change from basic 1040 to a schedule c business they rake you with fees. It is a bit much if you have never dealt with these type of rope them in then upsell for nominal fees. TurboTax works well even on a slow connection, and they have fast algorithms, that do your numbers crunching quite well. Valid suggestions included. Haven't had any breaches that I am aware of. Their servers set up a VPN tunnel when you log on. They also advertise that they run state of the art monitoring tools.
This tax preparer has been very accurate when it has come to my own personal tax preparations. Several times I have forgotten to claim certain benefits and it corrected me to make the claim. There are double checks all along the way to assist in filing correctly. Compared to companies offering tax preparation this system beats their price by at least 5 times. I buy this program every year without any regret. The ease of use of this program is very astounding. It offers two methods of calculation: For the novice it runs through the whole process page by page, prompting the user at each step. For the experienced filer, it offers the form by form calculations. I cannot definitively cover the security of this program since I have never had an issue to which I had to question the security. This alone does not give a true appraisal of its security, but it is my only experience.
They recheck for mistakes, they update every time you log on. You go through all the categories and subcategories to make sure nothing is missed or overlooked. You don't get that at a tax preparer's office. Compared to H&R block, extremely great value. Any preparer charges 150.00 and up. This is a most excellent deal at 49.99. You have to be a fool not to use it. They also ask all the right questions to get you the max amount of refund. They make it very easy, asking the right questions. They walk you through every category if you want or you can skip thru ones that don't pertain to you. You can save and go back any time to correct or fill in. That way you don't miss items. I have used them for yrs. and have never had my security compromised. Requires a password when filing and results go to your own email. I am in the comfort of my own home and not in an office where someone can hack.
Well worth the $25 for them to obtain all amounts, employer #s, fill out the forms, file electronically and store the info. Used them for the past 3 years, recommend highly & will be using them this year. Have received over $4000 that we didn't know about tax credits, over $1000 each year. Easy to navigate, good directions & their telephone assistance was prompt, thorough and professional. It's an excellent value. We wouldn't keep using them if it wasn't!!! Never had any type of security breach, and our tax refunds have always been deposited electronically into our bank account within days...
I thought this was a very accurate and easy to use program. About 6 years ago, after putting all the information into the program, I ended up owing money for Federal tax. I took the same information to a local CPA and wound up getting a good sized return. My advice if your taxes are very simple, and there are not a lot of special circumstances, the software is fine. Otherwise, it's wise to spend the extra money and use a CPA. It is worth it in the long run. It's much less expensive than a CPA. However, depending on your circumstances, you stand to receive a much better return using a CPA if you have a more complicated return. It is quite easy to use. However, I think the software misses out on a lot of deductions a human would easily recognize. If your returns are in any way complicated, use a CPA. I had no issues with security. I have not heard of anyone having any issues with the security of their information or having their social security # hacked.
Tax forms and filings were accurate but checkout at the end was a disaster. I don't think TurboTax should be able to charge additional fees to efile when their system is down and you can't call anyone without being hung up on repeatedly. I should have been able to pay for my efile with a credit or debit card but their system wasn't working again this year, so the only way to file is to pay the extra fee to allow them to take it out of my federal return. Terribly displeased with the difficulty of paying for efile. This company has to address this issue. This was the same issue last year where their system said the card wouldn't go through but when you check your bank account online, the transaction is right there! I believe that they will probably be hacked again this year since their primary concern seems to be the profit margin. When a company simply can't be bothered to fix a basic problem from last year, you know they haven't fixed their security either.
I can only assume it's accuracy as when I came to a bump in the road there was nothing or no person or number or online help to steer me to the correct answer for my purposes. If you value some measure of peace of mind I would say that devalues this product. I've not had any peace of mind since I tried it last year. I still worry that my information is out there and it's scary. I'd like to know that it is destroyed after being filed but there is nothing to say what happens to your personal information after it is filed. Again issues or questions and which direction to go can be challenging. You have to call someone, try looking for the information, make a guess about how to proceed and hope it is the right guess. I ended up calling my tax person who ended up doing my taxes. Not sure about the security, in fact the security is and remains an issue for me to this day. I didn't like that your social security number was one of the first pieces of information needed and that I couldn't go back and delete the entire thing after having fear set in.
Although I guess I don't know for sure, I've used TurboTax for at least five or six years now and I've never had any issues, audits, etc. as best as I can double-check their results, it always seems accurate to me. TurboTax is getting a little pricey these days if you need to upgrade to any of their specialty services. For me, I have to pay extra for their upgrades since I sell a lot of stock (via employee stock plan grants) throughout the year. You can't input any of your stock sale info without this level of upgrade. However, it does seem pretty thorough which is good. Still pricey in my opinion. TurboTax is really really easy!! People complain because it takes a long time, but it takes a long time because it holds your hand through every possible minute little thing and figures it all out for you. Even with confusing stock sale stuff like short-term capital gains, it does all the calculations. So, it does take a while to get your taxes done but you're more likely to do them thoroughly since TurboTax will make sure you get everything in there. TurboTax takes good security measures and I've never experienced any issues with my sensitive information not being handled appropriately. I'm confident in their security.
Any errors I have noticed has been very quickly corrected by Intuit. I have not noticed any errors in the last five years. While not a cheap program accuracy has been very good. The only problem of any significance was the program bundling and cost that was attempted last year. Stupid, stupid stupid and only when Intuit's feet were put to the fire was it corrected. The cost continues to go up while other tax revenue continues to go down. The way previous years are integrated into each year is a big value with regard to this program. But I repeat - The only problem of any significance was the program bundling and cost that was attempted last year. Stupid, stupid stupid and only when Intuit's feet were put to the fire was it corrected. The program's major problem is navigation and roll back. The buttons for back and forward using the advisor are constantly moving locations. When going back or reviewing previous contents, they may still be there and the field(s) may be blank or default to a set value. Once a selection has been determined, that value should remain the same when viewed later. I have not concerned with security. Intuit seems to always be checking their own servers and input to keep the bad guys out and the data secure.
I like them. They are very on point and they always help you along the way. If you put in the wrong information they help you to get choices of what is best for you, great. I have been doing my taxes for the past 4 years and I don't have to pay much to have it done. It does take time for you to gather all your papers. I would recommend them to everyone especially if you are doing single taxes. It is the easiest thing that you can ever do. You don't have to even think. Very secure. You get a copy of your documents electronically and it is also stored in your online account with them. Pretty safe, no issues as of yet.
I was told by a good friend about TurboTax, and I've used it ever since. It seems to be so easy if you have an easy return. That is no complications, just put down your info from W2 School and you're good. But if it's a little more then you run into trouble. For example I took out some money from my 401K, and it was not so easy. I did all the required steps and there were a hiccup. The money from 401K was somehow not listed and I ended up owning that tax. And I was told not to use them with that money, but I did. And I paid the price. As I said it's great for just putting in your information. But any extras you might want to go to a professional. Because this was an automated system, so follow the instructions. And wait and wait. Sometimes you might have to start over but it is very simple. Very easy, there is really easy step-by-step instructions. There might be a waiting period, but overall easy. As long as you follow simple directions, you're good. The security to my knowledge was good. I didn't feel like any of my information was being compromised. And this was a very real concern for me. With all the identity theft going on, you need to be sure. I did my research, and TurboTax made me feel secure.
Easy easy easy. How much can I say - it's accurate.
Seemed accurate. I wouldn't know for sure because I did not have an outside professional prepare my taxes, so I had nothing to compare it to. Seemed to be good value for the money. Much cheaper than going to a professional company/professional tax person. Definitely would use again. This program was pretty simple to use. Pretty straight-forward to use and definitely seemed geared toward the average citizen to be able to use. I think it was safe but I would have no way of knowing for sure. Nothing is truly extremely secure anymore these days, especially if it is online.
No mistakes to date by using this program. Very accurate in calculations. No returns have been returned to me saying there were errors in filing. Very easy to follow the program. Does all calculations for you. No paperwork required to complete your tax preparation. Highly recommend using. If you can read, you can complete the filing. Very easy to follow. Just follow each step in order and it will guide you to complete your filing. Have not heard of anyone being hacked into using this program. It states that it is a secure program to use and I believe it be that. Recommend it.
Very quick and easy. I have been using them for years without a problem. It is always stress free and I have never encountered any problems. I have no idea what you mean by value unless you are speaking of the price. It is definitely worth every penny for the deluxe version and is very accurate. It is so easy to use and it saves all your information from the previous year. If nothing or very little has changed then it is a breeze to do them. They are extremely secure and use all methods necessary to protect one's identity and information. I have had no problems with security in the past.
TurboTax online guarantees accuracy. I have never had an audit or any contact from IRS with concerns about any entries to any of my tax returns. I have not paid a fee for use of the TurboTax online tax preparation software. I've been using it for free since 2004 and the value is awesome! I've been using it for free since 2004 and it is very easy to use. Just enter the data and TurboTax does all of the calculating and makes suggestions. I've been using TURBOTAX ONLINE for free since 2004 and I've never had any security problems. I feel safe using the TurboTax online tax preparation software.
I have never had the IRS ask any questions about my returns prepared using their online program-- I value their product immensely for they provided peace of mind. This year, I am very grateful they chose to go completely free file, state and federal, as I am on a fixed income, and I will use them for 2015. They let the consumer go back and forth to ensure items do not get missed or skipped. They let you save and come back. I especially like their final review process. I have zero concerns thus far about the product security. I do read to discover whose companies have data breaches regularly to stay aware of risk.
2 of the last 3 years the IRS found errors and I had to pay extra with penalties. I got no back up from TurboTax. Evidently, if you don't buy their service, you can expect nothing. I could have done as well myself if I wanted to get into trouble. Why bother with TurboTax? As it turned out, they made the same mistake in the same area for years. It was easy to use all right! But it was wrong information. If you try to bring it to their attention, you get nothing back and they make no attempt to change it. The security seemed to be okay. I wish that they were as accurate with their content as they are with security.
My returns are simple and I expect the results to be accurate. I don't know how accurate this software would be for a more complicated tax return. The price for a simple return utilizing the standard deduction for a single taxpayer with no dependents is very reasonable. For a simple tax return utilizing the standard deduction, this tax preparation software is very easy to use. Help screens are readily available when needed. I've used TurboTax to file my tax returns for several years, and have not been notified of any security breaches. Wish I could say the same of my employer.
Have been using TurboTax for several years without any issues. As you go down through your return, TurboTax checks behind everything that you do for complete accuracy. Best way to get a good price on TurboTax is file early with offers that they give. Usually happens around early February, otherwise they can be on the pricey side. Very easy to use. Guides you through all areas and offers suggestions that you might have overlooked. No issues with security. Trust TurboTax. Have been with them for several years.
About the same as almost every other tax preparation assistance. I always look to find the lowest price and usually can find at least a $10.00 discount. I think I'd prefer to do my own taxes rather than spend what amounts to a bit more than 10% of my annual refund. I'm going to look into the possibility this year. Sometimes confusion, particularly navigating through previously completed sections after logging out and then in again to continue completion. I guess no one has hacked my return info as I've always gotten my refund check without any problem. I think the log in process is a bit weak when compared to a more secure site.
Easy to navigate, review questions, and all data is held for the following year's tax preparation. Any discrepancies are flagged so that the preparer can re-check. Software tailored to individual needs, from basic quick file to the more complex 1040 with attachments. The software guides a preparer through all the steps. Pretty much the same answer I've given before: easy to navigate, the software contains necessary forms for filing a complex 1040 and that's it! I don't think anything is secure anymore. Since we have to file the thing what's the difference? The government is going to find out the answers anyway, if they don't know already.
Up to date on the latest changes to the tax code. Fully explained, including the consequences of the new laws. All IRS forms are explained in detail. We use the Home and Business edition, and pay about $65. It's far less expensive than the services of a tax preparer, and well worth the cost. If you follow the very detailed instructions, you shouldn't have a problem. After all, these are government forms, so they can be a bit tricky. Take your time and you'll be fine. Turbo Tax has been around for quite a while, and its reputation is spotless. As much as can be expected, it's secure software. We've used it for years with no issues whatsoever.
I have used Turbotax for years and while not happy to see all the complaints, glad to see that I am not alone in being unhappy with this year's version of Turbotax. Very hard to use - couldn't even input our mortgage interest and there was no way I was going to be on hold for an hour! Am seriously considering switching to another software program like other reviewers. You used to be able use this program so much easier - it's not like we have a bunch of stocks, etc., however, I actually used Turbotax back about 8 years ago, and it worked great even for the more difficult return (Schedule A, C etc.). Shame!
We have used Turbo for the last 9 years without problems. This year is certainly worse. For Deductions & Credits/Estimates and Other Taxes Paid, the software told us we should use State and Income Tax for $5,461. However, the software is using only State Income for $1,035. After 4 calls and 6 hours waiting, the last call was disconnected AGAIN. We have gotten nowhere with Turbo Tax.
I've been with TurboTax for over 5 years. Unable to complete my taxes. Talked to customer service and the young lady that tried to help did her best. It was the IT dept she was chatting with didn't have a clue what to do. Will be using H & R Block now!
I have used TurboTax three years in a row. I have has issues each year but nothing like this. I moved from one state to another. I had a couple weird w2s. After I paid $110 to have my taxes done, "O wait we cannot e-file". Now I'm paying an accountant to redo my taxes. WASTE OF MONEY. Don't bother to call customer service, they couldn't help a eskimo make ice. Very low training and knowledge. Will not be using TurboTax again.
Never again, they charged me 106.00 for what I don't know because I never got to itemize my return. It kept taking me round and round. Same thing. No progress. Nothing counted - dental bills, gas, repairs. I delivered food in 2015. I thought something surely. Nope. Also my deduction from work was 1700. How in the world did I only get 1277. I got 545 every two weeks. I would get 265 out of that two week pay period. I'm still in debt. Thought this would help me at least for my dental bill 2000. Emailed, asked questions, even signed up to get a call back from customer service, never got that call. I would have been better off just going to the H&R Block. Screw this program. These guys are scam.
I started the TurboTax software with the intent to use their advertised $0 $0 $0 deal. Free federal, free state, zero to file. I started the return like usual but as soon as I hit 401K and pension income they tell me I need to upgrade to the deluxe version for $34.99. So I accept. By the time I got to the end of the return they tell me I have to upgrade to Premium for $54.99 and State will cost me $34.99 and that I can take the cost out of my federal fund. At that time, there was no "extra fee" warning about another $35 if you choose to pay the cost of your tax software with your refund. When I got to the end and they showed me my balance, I erased it all and processed my entire return with H&R Block's free return software with no added fees whatsoever. No more TurboTax for me.
I have been doing our own taxes for about 5 years using TurboTax and last year we received a letter letting us know that for the last 3 years our refund was incorrect and we have to pay it all back. TurboTax has put us in an awful predicament because we are a 1 income household now. It will take us forever to pay back the thousands we are required to pay back. Also all those commercials you are seeing now regarding file your taxes for free is NOT TRUE! Only a teen making minimum wage gets them done for free and when using the $34.99 program you get another $34.99 tagged on top for some 2nd or 3rd party processing fee and you don't see it coming till it's too late. Needles to say I will NEVER use TurboTax again. I should probably be suing them. If anyone here has had a similar experience I would to hear about it.
After starting the free version of TurboTax it said I needed to file a 1040 and as a result I had to purchase the Deluxe version. After doing this and completing the taxes for federal and two states, it wanted to charge me $37 to file each state after paying $35 for the Deluxe version. In addition, it would not let me print off the state returns to mail in. After two calls to TurboTax it was confirmed that this is part of the scam. I will now have to complete the state returns on paper and send them in on my own. The final part of the insult was that based on my income the initial recommendation to purchase the Deluxe version was wrong, but after doing so it will not allow you to use the free version. The state returns are now being held hostage by TurboTax. This is not like previous years where I purchased TurboTax and electronically filed my fed return and mailed in the states. I will never use TurboTax again and recommend you don't either.
Attempting to file VT state tax was a disaster - for no reason, TurboTax turned my $1097 state refund into a $3097 refund and that set off all kinds of warning/error messages. Went back and slowly entered info and SLAM - same error occurred. Won't use TurboTax again - a big waste of my time, a simple wage earner with one W-2.
I have used TurboTax for years with no problems. This year, for the first time, I had to call for support. I was on hold for 75 minutes before they were able to take the call. The representative repeatedly put me on hold while she researched my question (each time asking me to repeat my question). She said the answer was finally coming through to her and to hold for just another minute. Sixty minutes later she had not come back, but the call was not disconnected. I'm quite sure she decided not to work the call because she couldn't come up with the answer, so put it on hold and went to the next call. I am extremely offended and will never again purchase TurboTax. I will also do all I can to recommend that others do not purchase it.
TurboTax just ripped us off. We paid $34.99 for our taxes to be done & we lost an additional $34.99 in a refund processing fee. Beware people, don't let them take the $34.99 out of your tax refund. They will double charge you! They claim it's because a third party bank processes the refund but the way their disclosure is set up when you submit your return, it appears that you're agreeing to have just their $34.99 taken out of your refund. USE A CREDIT CARD!
This is the first year I filed my own taxes. I filed them 13 days ago and while reading online I read that the IRS wouldn't direct deposit into an account if your name isn't on there (which I should have known). Anyways, I called the customer service number for TurboTax and the gentleman I was connected to was one of the worst customer service people I've ever tried to deal with. He was very rude and hung up on me after maybe 3 min on the phone when I was just asking him what would happen to my refund. I think when someone is working in "customer service" they should be willing to help people. I also think TurboTax should be monitoring the people they have working there because I'm sure I'm not the only one who catches his terrible attitude today. It also says that calls are recorded for quality assurance so they should go back and listen to this recording!
I, too, have used TT for many years, paying for the deluxe edition. However, can no longer access previous years returns. After I had successfully filed my taxes, and paid the fee, I get an email from Turbo Tax stating that it looks like I had a duplicate account. I also forgot username/password, and filed under a different email address. Went to try to merge, and guess what? They are unable to merge. So I AGAIN paid for their "Plus" service. Called immediately. After a phone conversation with Turbo Tax that lasted 1 hour, I checked my bank. Instead of refunding the $29.99, THEY CHARGED ME TWO MORE TIMES! I immediately called them back. Had to wait and receive a return call. Again. I explained the situation. Again. I was asked to hold and she would be right back. I was disconnected. I called back. Again. Had to wait and receive a return call. After 45 minutes, still no return call. I will be calling my bank and reporting the errors. I will never use this service again. I highly recommend finding another way to do taxes. TurboTax is incompetent and shouldn't be allowed to continue.
I've used TurboTax for years and overall it is a good tax program that is easy to use. One change this year was the requirement (apparently Intuit's, not the government) for the user to input their state ID info- for most, this will be their driver license number, and then the issue date and expiration date. What this does is place this personal ID info into Intuit's databases, which can then be breached or hacked, exposing this personal ID data. This has caused me to reject the e-file version and go with mailing the forms. That's not a hardship for me since I get little to no return- I do not loan the government money interest free. If this requirement returns for 2016, I will avoid the software altogether.
After I have prepared our taxes online, I saved the file on TurboTax's website and quit to finish in another day. When I came back a week after, My login info has been compromised. After verifying my identity, I was able to get it and found out that the same return I prepared and saved has been e-filed by the hacker/hackers and banking routing/checking numbers were changed to a pre-paid card from American Express Centurion bank. March 9th was when the return was filed. Discovered it the night of March 12th. Return was "Accepted" by IRS. Called IRS the morning of March 13th to notify them that the return they received DID NOT come from me. Agent on phone said "return would be flag". Called American Express in Utah and informed them of fraud and Heidi from fraud department blocked the account. Tracking return thru IRS app. Return got approved March 15th and refund was STILL sent on March 18th. Called American Express again and Heidi advised me that the refund was rejected the same day it came in. Filed my return thru mail and after seeking help from Taxpayers Advocate, I still have no refund 10 months after we got hacked and looks no hope of getting it thru IRS. IRS recommending filing a suit against the hacker (how can you file a suit to someone you don't even know who or where), and/or Turbotax. Phoned TurboTax recently and voicing out my complaint that they could have stopped the hackers from getting the money since I had informed them of such illegal activity and the TurboTax's representatives response was, "we are not allowed to intervene if there was a fraud being committed"! Seriously???
I filed my state return with TurboTax. There was a false issue with tax credit from coming from another state. I tried to fix it but the page was hard bolded and could not be amended. I spoke to at least 7 TurboTax employees who could not fix this problem. I am disgusted with TurboTax's inability to fix a glitch in their software and the fact that I spent 5 hours working on this. In addition, TurboTax has over 30 minutes wait time to receive a call and when they do they don't know their own software. Why is TurboTax still in business? I saw 1400 complaints about them online.
Also have used TurboTax for years with no problem until (apparently) 2013 version. Entered all 1099's correctly, triple-checked. 2 yrs later got IRS bill for over $2k for incorrect pension tax calculation by software and 2013 had no worksheet I could go back to to check calculation. Was unable to locate any phone no. for TurboTax to call them. Learned this year that Intuit software freely available on a larger site, Personal Capital, which wants to persuade you to invest with them, operated by the owner of Intuit. Buyer Beware!
I was having trouble logging into my account because I forgot my password. I called tech support for help. First I was called back within 5 mins. Second Megan the young lady who called me back was awesome!! She was pleasant, patient and helpful every step of the way!! It was the first time I got help over the phone without the tech making me feel like I was an idiot!! If you do have a problem with TurboTax, call tech support and ask for Megan!! She is great!
TurboTax makes decent software program but the supervisors in Customer Service are amazingly incompetent. For the second year in row I have spent hours and days on the phone trying to fix a TurboTax problem that should take five minutes. This year, TurboTax has inexplicably locked me out of my own account and no one there can figure out why or how to fix it! Yes, amazing but true. By necessity, I will try a competitor's product. If you use TurboTax, pray everything works well and you don't have to pick up the telephone. You will be lost to a byzantine and bizarre world of incompetence.
I have used TurboTax for about 20 years, been quite happy... until I bought the 2014 Deluxe Version (that I have used for at least the last 15 years!). Intuit pulled so many features that I could not do a Schedule C for stocks, or Schedule E for at-home (very) small business... Seriously??? The software is forcing me to upgrade for those features. I've been had and considering other options. Why after 15 years (or longer) would they make such huge changes in one year without any warnings? And seriously, they are going to continue calling the version "Deluxe"? Would appreciate hearing from someone from Intuit quickly or I'm gone.
Since 2005 I have used TurboTax for filing my taxes. But back in 2015 when we filed our return the system clicked and information was frozen for a few minutes. We were able to continue and filed our tax return having the fees deducted from our refund. But what I am upset about is under the refund page of TurboTax was a message regarding our refund. When we clicked on it the amount was about $2,100 more than we had received. I tried to contact TurboTax after the IRS said that was what their records showed but was unsuccessful. About a month or so ago I was able to speak with someone at TurboTax and they said I needed to file an amended return. But they have already loaded software for the new tax season. How could this have happened that we did not receive our complete refund? I feel a little worried about trying to go after this because I don't want the IRS coming after us for fraud. Other people that used the service also in their forum stated they had this same issue. Just want what is owed to us, nothing more.
First, I paid for their Deluxe product, when filling my 2013 taxes in 2014. One of the options is access to prior years returns when paying for Deluxe. Well they factored in an inaccurate deduction costing me $800, which I found out via notice from the IRS in 2015. I've hired a tax attorney to help resolve this issue, and they need a copy of my 2013 return. So I logged into my Turbotax account thinking I could get a copy of my 2013 return. Well, it's locked, and they will not provide it unless you pay, and file your current years tax return with them. WHY DID I PAY FOR DELUXE IN THE FIRST PLACE?! And now not get the benefits of it. They advertise no hidden fees. This is false advertising.
I filed Oct. 12, 2015, after filing an extension in April. I filed online, paid 204.00, and find out today that my taxes were not filed, my return copy that they have is corrupted, and they want to pretend it is my fault. I have copies of my return and paperwork, and will have to send the IRS a copy. It was the fault of Turbo Tax, but they will not refund my payment. Never again.
I have used TurboTax for filing my US tax online on 14th April 2014 and TurboTax has deducted the online tax filing fee USD32 on 6th June 2014. But so far not received refund. Can I get some support to get my USD1685 back?
I received an email from TurboTax today which stated that my social security number and bank information would be shared with others... And that I cannot opt out of that. How is this legal? Customers are at higher risk of identity theft. They did a fine job of my taxes, but I am reconsidering whether to use their service again. The policy makes it clear that if you are no longer their customer, they continue to share your info. Scary!
Processing taxes through TurboTax.com is a breeze only if you have straightforward taxes to file, without any extra information required. From the summer of 2012 to 2013 both of my ailing parents passed away, and I was laid off from my job in between. My sister and her husband tried to put me on their health insurance, but we were denied. The time period after that literally flew by as a blur of legal matters, and finding a new job to start over. I found temp work but didn't have health care until Fall 2014. I had to explain this on my taxes, and get an approval certificate, in order to avoid a penalty fee. I submitted the application and everything went through easily. Except for the fact that they listed the wrong approval year information on the certificate!!! And the correct information was listed ALL over my application. I now have to get this corrected to submit it with my taxes this year! I called the health care marketplace the TurboTax website had sent me to for the application, they confirmed that they were not the correct resource. But they did tell me it's mandatory that I get this fixed. I tried to locate a number on the TurboTax website, but got nowhere. I called the health care marketplace again, and they confirmed I had to contact TurboTax. So I tried their website again, and I am STILL going in circles! It has a false button that says to click for Human Help, when you click the button it only leads you to the community response board and the button is grayed out so the Call Us hyperlink does not work. No matter what question I typed in, all I got was community solutions suggested. This year I am just going to pay to have my taxes done right the first time. This is absolutely ridiculous that they don't have a service center considering this is dealing with taxes!
I need to revise the tax, but I need to talk to someone. TurboTax does not have anyone (except a computer) which does not understand non-native accent. I am disappointed and will look for another product for this year.
I received a notice from the IRS about an error for my 2013 tax year. I have to pay $400 in interest and penalties. Confirmed that it was not my error and found that TurboTax calculated an overpayment incorrectly. Submitted the form to TurboTax for reimbursement of the interest and penalties but Turbotax rejected it. Their explanation is incorrect, but I can't get through to them to review it again. When I call, they have you enter a number so they can call back. I found each time the phone never rings, just goes to voice mail so I never get the opportunity to talk to someone. I think TurboTax is hoping for me to just go away. Terrible service. If they just acknowledged the error and give me my interest and penalties then I would continue to use their services but I now I will never use them again. I will continue to try and get through.
Major issues with software ref. healthcare coverage. Customer Service-tech support said it was my error inputting information. Also told by deluxe edition that no underpayment penalty was owed. Got the bill plus interest today. Customer service-tax expert said it was my error inputting information. Everything is the consumer's error.
I was so disappointed that the 2014 Deluxe Version (that I have used since 1996) had so many features pulled that I could not do a Schedule C for stocks and Schedule E for at-home business! I only got, "You have to upgrade for those features..." Why after 20 years would they change a product so drastically?? Every other software ADDS features over time! I will be watching their 2015 product very closely.
Contacted Turbo Tax for assistance to use upgraded version just purchased online. They replied at 6:10 that they would call me. Three hours later no call. Did taxes the old fashioned way - by myself without their help and finished. Would like refund for purchase of upgrade. Caused me a lot of aggravation.
It got even worse as I finished up in an endless loop. I was able to contact TurboTax and wasted nearly another half hour explaining the problem to the customer service rep and being put on hold and then being asked for the same info again and then the process repeated. I remarked that I've already read that to you twice before, why do you want it again? The response being that she needed to write it down. This rep seemed to know nothing about the software she was supposed to be helping on. I was finally able to get through to another rep who understood what the problem was within the first minute and made suggestions to resolve it. These suggestions did not resolve the basic problem, but the overpayment did show as an amount to be refunded, but the 1040X problem remained. However, I am increasing the star rating because of the attitude of the second customer service rep who I believed made a sincere attempt to help and was knowledgeable and professional.
I was was trying to figure out why our tax bill has been so high even after our second child, and it turns out that TT has so many bugs! It zeroed out my youngest child as a dependent, did not give us the PMI deduction and miscalculated the Sales Tax!!! We have been using TT since 2012 and now I will have to pay a real CPA to figure out what we should have paid and what we should have been refunded. NEVER USE TURBO TAX!
As though TurboTax should help you thru the steps of entering correct information, they failed to recognize me taking a IRA distribution and adding it to my income. If this is a step by step process, they surely missed. I called to complain after my 3660.00 audit by the IRS. Thank you very much TurboTax.
We have used several different electronic tax services through years and found that Intuit TurboTax offers nothing special. And while it offers no advantages they will not let you get copies of previous years tax returns without purchasing a new service. It is very deceptive business practice. Go with an honest company that does not trick you!
I've used Turbo Tax for years. Every year it gets more difficult to navigate. I still recommend it but it's very difficult to adapt to the changes every year that make it less user friendly. Don't know what they're thinking making the changes they do. They don't make any more money by making it user unfriendly.
I have used TurboTax for years for sometimes very complicated returns. I needed to retrieve my 2014 federal page one for insurance reasons. I paid to have my return in their 'Vault', in case I needed it in the future. Well, I'm locked out, TT has not helped me one bit, and the only thing I can do now is pay another $29+ fee to MAYBE get my 2014 federal 1040. The only 1040 I can click on is my 2013 and that one re-routes me to a payment screen. Frustrating. Never using them again.
I have been using TurboTax for decades and have always bought about a $59 dollar Homeowners Deluxe version. I did notice that the Deluxe version I bought was a little less expensive but I didn't notice that Capital gains/losses was no longer included, nor did I notice that a State download was not included. Shame on me but I just wasn't paying attention! While doing my taxes, I felt I had no choice but to upgrade to Premier for a fee of $30 to claim my small Capital gain and then discovered I had to download the State for $40 which I never imagined that it wasn't included in the Deluxe Homeowners version. I'm a 76 year old retiree and my return is not complicated. Needless to say I am not happy that I had to spend an additional $70 to complete my income taxes. I hope that you have a product next year that meets my needs at a reasonable price. I won't make the same mistake again. Thank you for listening.
I used TurboTax to file for my 2014 taxes in January this year. Apparently even though they automatically uploaded by W-2's from my company's payroll system, they miscalculated my withholding, so instead of the $2300 refund I have been waiting 6 months for, I was hit with a $400 charge from the state of NJ - including a late fee. I will not use TurboTax again.
During the latest forced "upgrade" nothing worked. After the usual hours on the phone with Intuit I decided to give up and use a new AMERICAN credit card processing company. You know, the ones where they speak English and pay US taxes. There is a reason Intuit gets such horrible reviews! When something works why not just leave it alone? This company has gotten my last dollar.
I received a tax deficiency notice from the State of Colorado. Turns out that some of the supporting schedules prepared by TurboTax (for example 104CR) were not e-Filed by Intuit, even though Intuit eFile told me my return was accepted by the State. The schedules not filed by eFile were prepared and I can print them. How could e-File miss filing two of the schedules required by my State return??? I want a refund of the e-File fee. I've now wasted nearly 3 hours answering State DOR letters and filing a protest. Intuit's lack of accessible customer service and the inability of their chat agents to understand even the simplest of problems, marks Intuit as a consumer unfriendly company. They suck.
TT confirmed that the e-file went thru and I then found over a month later, when I noticed that my checking account was not debited, that the file was NOT received. THAT COST ME 5% A MONTH of the tax payment. For sure I will NOT use such a crappy product again, and there is no way to actually contact them w/o difficulty to let Intuit what I think of this. THIS COST ME MONEY!!! And yes I have a paper receipt saying it went thru, doubters.
Bought Intuit's 2014 Turbo tax software to file my taxes and I was unfortunate to be victim of identity theft. Spoke with the customer service folks several times to resolve the issue and they gave me the free credit bureau service and was asked to give them a copy of my receipt for $69.54 to get the refund for the software. Sent them the copy of the receipt back in April and again 2 more times to the same email ID, and they still can't figure out even after 8 weeks why I have not got the check or even acknowledge the receipt of my email. They asked me to resend the email with the receipt to them today after 8 weeks. What?!? And on top of that the customer service folks hang up after putting us on hold and this happened several times. Doesn't look like they want to resolve issues. A big company like this should be getting their act together and make a software that actually works right!! I switched from H&R software to this company thinking it was better, but by the look of it I think it's dangerous to be using their software for fear of being hacked! I want my $69.54 back and quick. Help! Thanks.
This my opinion based on my experience. I filed over three months ago and I still have not received my return nor any letters by mail or email. I checked online and no records were found of my filing. I've tried calling and it's impossible!!! How in the world am I supposed to find out what's going on if the IRS can't tell me themselves!?!
I recently got audited by the State from taxes filed back in 2011. I have been using turbo tax for several years and this was the first. After receiving the letter, which stated I owe them 600$, which included fees accumulated since 2011, naturally I was upset and confused! I wasn't given any info on why and me not being savvy in this area I called Turbo Tax since they "guarantee" accuracy, have free audit protection and say you can get help 24 hr a day. Well... After calling day in and day out and not being able to get through to TT and not getting any real help online to questions I had I had to go to H&R Block for help since I had a deadline to pay my 600$. H&R Block amended my taxes, although I still owed the State, which was more $$ out of my pocket. H&R said that my wages on one of my W2's wasn't calculated in my state income tax. If I recall correctly, information is supposed to carry over from Federal so in my opinion there was some sort of glitch. Finally, after 3 MONTHS of calling and getting the right person to talk to and look at my previous taxes she told me to file the accuracy guarantee claim for reimbursement, which I did. However, she also gave me the incorrect info and I told me if TT was wrong I would get fully reimbursed and if their calculation was right I would still get reimbursed fees I had. From the get go I had a feeling they were going to say they weren't wrong, bc when have you really had it that easy, but they also don't reimburse you for anything when they said they calculated right. Moving forward, they said "I" checked a box saying exclude my income from state. Lmao. First, the box they screen shot for me I have never seen in all the years I have used TT, has anyone else? And if it is there, I'm sure I didn't check it or like I said maybe there was a glitch bc there was another boxed checked under it that they didn't explain what it was. So all in all with this rant, I'll most likely continue to owe the state if this box exists and has carried over all these years and TT doesn't guarantee anything or even provide the assistance you need to figure it out. I always that wow, TT is easy, no hassles, it's guided well after years of thinking my friends were paranoid I should have went to their tax consultant. I will never recommend TT or use them again. Good Luck to anyone that's audited, it's beyond anxiety provoking
Turbo Tax eliminated some forms on the premier edition for 2014. I needed to purchase the update which I did for $31.88, order #**. I applied for a $25.00 refund that they were offering on 3/22/15 and was told that I had to wait until my 2014 taxes were filed. I did file them but did not receive my refund until after the 4/20/15 date and now am told that this offer ended. How can I get reimbursed for the update purchased?
One week in May 2015 I got two letters from the IRS. One for 2013. One for 2014. In 2013 I used TurboTax as I have for many years in the past. I input all of my 1099s, W-2s and every other document I had to input as evidenced by it being on the schedule as a taxable event. The mistake ended up with me getting a letter May from the IRS I owe $4,797. In 2014 the same thing. The information was properly and TurboTax failed to calculate the proper amount of my refund in my favor. So I had to make arrangements with the IRS for 2013 to pay the $4,797 and amend my taxes to indicate the proper amount of my refund for 2014. What bothers me most is that the TurboTax program is not working properly. Placing the information in does not mean it will be calculated properly. TurboTax offered to pay any penalties and interest which is only $169. WOW. I am beyond disappointed.
I have used TurboTax for many years. Back in 2001, I used TaxCut for a couple of years, but TurboTax has been my mainstay. After this year, I will be looking for a new program, and I would advise anyone reading this to do the same. I purchased the Deluxe as usual, and about halfway through, discovered that I needed to upgrade to the Premier for an additional amount. A week after I purchased the upgrade, they decided to give the upgrade free. Since I had already purchased the upgrade, I tried contacting the company for a refund on my additional investment, and hit a stone wall. The emails were never answered and the person I spoke with said they would reimburse me $25.00 after I filed. I, of course, did not qualify for the $25.00 when it came time to collect. I had some 1099s from companies operating in the State of Utah. The last three numbers of producer's account number were different from what TurboTax wanted. They are correct but TurboTax would not recognize them. The only answer TurboTax had was I would have to print them and send in the forms myself even though I had purchased a state e-file. If the company can't even stay abreast of correct account numbering and fails including the necessary forms in the software, then I feel it is time to invest in someone else's product.
I just got a notice from IRS, we owe over $10,000. I don't call that a little error. To top it off TurboTax computed my taxes the same way this year. I found out my retirement disability is taxable income. As soon as I put in the disability code, my income went to nontaxable. I totally thought Turbotax was right. I will never use them again. Now I have paid an attorney, so more money.
Filed my taxes through TurboTax online and my routing and account numbers mysteriously changed from the numbers that I typed, and my state and federal refund went to this bogus account. In conversations with TurboTax they claim that they don't see a problem on their part and are puzzled as to happened.
I have used Turbo Tax to file my taxes as well as filing for my family members and have had few issues with the service. However, this year had a very different issue. I chose e-file and I thought I was done, I was wrong. An email followed shortly after saying my taxes had been rejected by the IRS. The email indicated that it would help me "fix errors". After several attempts to correct any errors I called Turbo Tax. The time I spent on hold was unacceptable. Even worse, the phone was answered by someone who assured me they would help me. He was unprofessional, clearly speaking from a script, he asked me to spell my basic name several times, it seemed like he had no typing skills. He finally took my error code and said I would need to be on hold for (an experienced) supervisor. Again I was on hold f-o-r-e-v-e-r, over an hour! More attempts to file, more "supervisors". No one knew what the problem was! With one comment my friend was able to tell me "Oh, someone took your identity number." She was right! Unbelievable! This happened to thousands of people yet Turbo Tax was unaware of the very common error code! By implying that I could "fix my errors" I wasted days trying to do so! My identity had been stolen and the IRS issued a fraud alert on my SS number! The quality of Turbo Tax agents is questionable! I trusted my personal information with someone perhaps working from home! If they are unable to identify a common error how can they be trusted with complicated issues? I value my time and do not appreciate the amount of time I spent on the phone on hold! I am frustrated with their lack of experience! They need to invest in training their employees as well as get more for phone support.
I received a social security 1099 for a large negative amount which TurboTax had an input form for, but they did not use it for a credit or deduction. It is very clear from IRS regulations (IRS 915) that taxpayers who have paid in more than they received can receive a credit or deduction. However, TurboTax completely missed it. It took me a day to clean it up. They did give me a refund for the cost of TurboTax, but this did not cover the aggravation and the effort involved. Clearly, one of the major purposes of a tax preparation program is to maximize deductions. They totally messed up on this one.
I submitted my taxes thru turbotax and paid the $144.98 to do so, but when I submitted them they were rejected and I had to print my taxes and submit them by taking them to their proper building myself.
TurboTax was deducted from my federal taxes. Now they took more out of my bank account. I want the 29.00 plus the 35.00 fee insufficient funds fee. I only ok them to take money off my federal taxes. I want my 70.00 back in my bank account now. That's my bill money.
I filed my taxes with Turbo but I guess they did not take my info to the IRS.. They want more money to complete my tax return which I did when I filed on April 13, 2014. I can't believe that they are still in business.. I will never deal with them again.. WHY would this so-called company ask for more money before we can complete the information that I gave to them? I thought it was very odd that they are not out to help those that cannot afford to pay someone to help us file. Turbo told me that my tax was completed and I expected a check. WHY did they do this and I am sure that I am not the only person who has wanted and been honest.. When I saw them on my computer, Turbo wanted another 39 dollars.. I already did that.. If I did not, I could not complete my taxes nor would they let me.. This is a scam and I want to know WHAT the BBB will do about this crooks trying to rip off a person who wants and needs their refund as soon as they can get it.. This company brings tears to my eyes. I counted on seeing that maybe I could take a trip to see my kids but NO WAY NOW!! Yes, maybe I will get a third job and bring on more stress in my life. I am a divorced single woman trying to work and keep a roof over my head like so many others in this country of ours.. What do I do now? Hire an account to do my late taxes. I am in such a bad way. AND now can't even catch up with my rent!!! THANK YOU TURBO for you being so dishonest.. Or maybe now, my check will be in the MAIL but does not seem that way.. YOU don't even have a TEL # to call and that says something about YOU.. YES, THE BBB will take care of this scam...
I, too, am unhappy to find out the refund Intuit offered for their tax program that was changed and not obvious was only offered for a very short time after filing your tax. There was no notification of the time limit and it was extremely unrealistic for most people to file. I also found mistakes but could not verify if they were the fault of TurboTax or the download from the contributing bank. Fortunately, I caught them before filing.
I tried TurboTax this year. I signed up for their "free" federal return. I found out that they couldn't do my taxes as I have 1099's, so I canceled. I have been charged a monthly fee since February for something I have not used. Now I'm fighting with my bank for fees and NSF charges because I cannot get turboripoff to stop charging my account. What a bunch of frauds. They should be prosecuted.
I filed with TurboTax January 26th 2015. I received a notice from the IRS that my money would be in my account by Feb. 5th. If I did not receive it by the 9th, to contact my bank. I did and they said they never received it. I tried contacting IRS, to no avail, so I contacted TurboTax March 26th. I was informed they could not deliver it to the bank. They claim the bank refused it. Never did they contact me , telling me this. They said the funds were returned to the IRS. I called the IRS and they said they never received it but would activate a tracer. After 8 weeks, I got a letter today (May 19) that it was with TurboTax. I called them and they state it is with a special arm of the IRS. I asked to speak to a manager and was told they would call me back. An hour has passed and no call! I will never do business with these people again and I encourage others to do the same.
Filed mine and my son's MN State Taxes and both of us paid the $19.95 each and filed March 11, 2015. And here it is, May 17, 2015 and we still have not received our returns. Very disappointed in this. We pay for the TurboTax Deluxe and then have to pay for another state on top of the free state due to we have to file in 2 states and then pay $19.95 each to e-file. So I feel TurboTax Intuit gets good money from us each year and we didn't get what we paid for.
TurboTax offered $25 rebate for those that had to buy a more expensive product than the previous year. It was to overcome the customer backlash that evolved. They did not fix things and fall flat on their face. The promise is bogus! I was not allowed to get my $25 refund "until my taxes were filed." Now I find out that the offer expired 5 days after tax filing date. This is unacceptable! TurboTax screwed up in marketing and received a backlash from loyal customers. They need to do what is right and refund as promised! There are alternatives to TurboTax.
In 2010 I e-filed for free with TurboTax from IRS website for FY 2009. TT offered to prepare my state taxes and I clicked, "yes." I file Head of Household with the IRS. In 2009 I received a full EIC and additional child tax credit as well as my federal taxes paid returned. When my state tax was prepared, TT said I owed the state $474. What???? I was mad at the state of Iowa and did not file my state taxes... Of course the state of Iowa tracked me down and I prepared my own state IND return. I discovered that in FY 2009 TT did not pull the line of taxes paid from W2 nor was I asked the amount paid in state taxes. I paid over $500 and was due a refund from the state. TurboTax did my taxes WRONG!!!! How many tax payers in the state of Iowa overpaid their taxes and now there is NOTHING that can be done... TurboTax got away with it... as usual.
After e-filing and going back to correct an error I made. I noticed the amount of the refund had changed to a lesser amount. The error I had to correct had nothing to do with changing amounts. I had to correct my SS #. I took pictures of the original amount. I know if the IRS had changed the amount they would have sent a letter explaining the change. I am also concerned now about the amount I was penalized for not having insurance. But I have photos for the refund amount changing with no explanation. They also charged my son a ridiculous price for filing and he was using the free app he made under 13000. As far as consequences, not sure except there's no way to reach TurboTax or Intuit about the matter. I just don't like being ripped off no matter what the amount. They steal a small amount from a lot of people, it adds up. I am an honest person and it makes me feel very foolish, angry and to not be able to get answers very frustrating.
Ok, just got home today and opened two letters from NYS tax department. One says my tax payment of 515.00 was returned because it was the wrong amount. I owed 517.89, not 515.00. The second says I now owe a fee for BEING LATE!!! Thank you TurboTax AND thank you New York State. You both should keep each other company because no one else will...
I've just realized that there is no space to report withheld taxes on mandatory withdrawals of IRA funds. I'm an old person. I fill out what TurboTax asks for, and file, electronically. Supposedly, all is checked, and okay. I've had $800. withheld, to help with my tax amount. I've tried the amend route, but the instructions led me nowhere. I'm absolutely sure I've overpaid, for several years, without realizing… until now. Totally ticked. No help from TurboTax, because talking with someone is not an option.
Purchased their TurboTax online to file my personal & federal taxes. The online program would not let me download nor e-file my tax forms. The whole reason I PAID for the service was so that I could do it online. I ended up having to manually do my taxes and mail. I WILL NEVER USE ANY TURBOTAX PRODUCT AGAIN! Be warned.
Submitted an extension on April 15th using TurboTax, and received verification email that the Federal and State had accepted my extension and also verified by TurboTax. After completing my tax returns on April 25th, paid TurboTax fee of $204, and was ready to submit online. My attempts to electronically file were declined, stating my tax ID was already associated with a tax filing previously submitted. Found an 800 phone # on TurboTax that would provide my tax filing status. When I called and entered my social security #, the recording stated the returns had already been 'received' on April 2nd, and the refund would be received on or before April 23rd. To add insult to injury, TurboTax asked for payment of $204 - again - in order to print my returns. Good News - IRS spotted the suspicious filing and declined the fraudulent return. I still must address identity theft via filing a police report, contacting banks and credit agencies, etc.
I filed my state returns in January. It has been 3 months and no refund has been issued. I just found out it is only TurboTax clients who are affected because intuit allowed hackers to get people's information. There was also no follow up with my federal taxes. They say they will let you know when it is approved and when a refund was issued. I got my federal refund months ago and TurboTax still says they are only at the accepted stage. I understand that it is a free service, but if they cannot protect their clients or hold up to their promises, then they are worthless. I definitely will not be using them again next year.
Avoid Intuit and certainly TurboTax at any cost. Forced to purchase an upgrade for $25 with understanding that this would be refunded after tax was submitted. Not only was this so called upgrade later provided for free, these clowns would not honor their promise for returning the $25. When we tried to submit the garbage needed for processing the refund, our request was denied because the cutoff date was "4/20/2015" - 5 days after the tax submittal date. We called to protest and they told us to pound sand! Never again. Suggest you find a cheaper honest alternative!!
You know, I love the idea of this service. I've used it in the past and loved it. BUT, over the last two years, I have an such incredibly bad experiences. I'm sure I will never use this service again. Last year, their program FLAT OUT lost my return TWICE! That's right. I actually had to re-enter it 2x. The customer service process throughout was beyond abysmal. I got the sense that no one knew anything about how the program worked, anything about Canadian tax law, or about what the company's policies and procedures were. This year... This year has been even worse.. For some strange reason it was claiming that I was trying to claim the Overseas Employment Tax Credit. No explanation as to why. I wasn't. I never checked anything off. TOOK OVER 10 HOURS dealing with customer service, DAYS in between one person telling me one piece of advice (after which I'd quickly follow up), and the next person following up with me with a completely different set of instructions. I actually started my return in the beginning of April. Now it's almost the deadline. There is still no resolution. AND NOW there is a new error - saying I'm at risk of an audit for claiming my medical expenses. No one knows anything at customer service. They are SO FIRED.
This concerns TurboTax Deluxe (Intuit): I bought this software in December (have gotten this version every year for 10 years). When I began doing our taxes in late January, a nasty surprise awaited me--A corporate decision was made to delete Schedule C from this package, so I had to upgrade to Premier for c. $42, which I did. Shortly after, the CEO sent an apology email to customers saying they'd made a mistake with that decision and would offer a $25 rebate to anyone who had bought the upgrade, after they had filed their taxes. About a week later, I get an e-mail saying that upgrade would now be offered for free. Fast forward...Filed our taxes in late March and went to their website where I could supposedly apply for the rebate. It didn't work for some reason--said I was ineligible (even though I have an e-mail receipt for the upgrade purchase). So it said if there was a problem, to call a "dedicated" toll-free number, which I did. But because it was a few days before April 15th, apparently this phone number "dedicated" to those with rebate problems, was the same one where people were calling with last-minute filing questions. No reps could help with any other issue; the recording said to call back after April 15th. However, there was one hitch--you had to apply for the rebate before midnight on April 20th. Of course, my printed reminder of this deadline got buried under work papers and I just found it today on April 23rd. I just called the toll free number again, and they are "sorry but they cannot do anything as the rebate deadline has passed." This is a total scam. I am really disgusted with the lack of customer service by TurboTax and Intuit and will consider using another form of software if they do not make this situation right. Addendum: My receipt shows the "Home and Business" upgrade but I had to upgrade in the middle of figuring out my taxes and when I needed to use Schedule C, this is what the software said to upgrade to. (I thought it was Premier). Also, when I tried to apply for the rebate online it asked for the last four of my SS number. At first, I gave mine and that didn't work. Then, because my husband was listed first on the form as taxpayer, I tried his SS#; that did not work either, and I got the attached response.
Preparing my tax return and program said I needed to update to premier due to a schedule being changed. They said since this was not previously required that the $39.99 update would be "free" this time, so I updated. When I completed my return it added the upgrade fee to my tax return. When I contacted them they said had I paid by credit card they would have credited my card. But, because I had deducted from my return I was out of luck. They couldn't send me a check. NOWHERE WAS I TOLD WHAT MY PAYMENT OPTIONS WERE. It took 4 calls and each time I was told it would be 4 to 6 weeks for a refund only to be told the last time there would not be a refund. I had documentations of payments being issued which turned out to be lies by every TurboTax associate I spoke with. I will never ever use TurboTax again.
TurboTax locked me out of my account and I have spent 2-1/2 hours on hold. Finally got through and was told my account was now unlocked but guess what? No, it is not unlocked and I have been waiting for a call back for 40 minutes now after being told there was a 5 minute waiting time. I will never use this service again.
After thinking I had filed electronically, and receiving "verification" from TurboTax that the IRS accepted my return, I come to find out the IRS has no record of my return! Calling TurboTax was a complete waste of time, as they just told me to call the IRS. Absolutely terrible customer service. The IRS number they gave me has zero options to talk to a human. Thanks TurboTax!
Used TurboTax since 90's. Installed Deluxe in Apr, online updated, had to upgrade to Premier for $30 (was infuriated). Tried to get $25 refund online, was rejected, had to call Intuit; again was incensed. Intuit not very proactive! Very unhappy!
I have used TurboTax for 4 yrs. This year after I spent about 1 hr answering (??), at the end I had to pay premium because my school tuition (I didn't last yr) and it charged me $30 for direct deposit. I spent almost $100 to do my own taxes. Never again!
I did my taxes on my iPhone. When I got to the end where you pick options to pay, I paid using iTunes. In the end I got an error message and have not been able to get logged back in. I did finally get to talk to a person but she was no help. I had asked her if my taxes were filed or not and her response was this. "Well, getting an error message should have be your first clue that they had not been filed, your funds are on hold for 5-7 days and then they will be returned to you". When I asked why my money had been taken at all, she tried to tell me that it hadn't been taken. I informed her that I had talked with the bank and Apple and they both said that the payment had been taken. Now two weeks later, my $100+ dollars has not been returned and I can not get a hold of anyone at turbo tax. So, they not only provide bad service, they are thieves also. If this changes in the near future, I will update it.
This year's Turbotax is way way beyond crap. It is a waste of time. I'm on hold now... I've been on hold for almost 4 hours now trying to get this software to work. I called last week and was given a case number **. The person said that gave me that number said, "Call on Monday and give tech that number and they will be able to fix the software". It is Monday now... When I gave that number to the first person that I talked to, she told me that there was no info connected with that number and that even though I waited for an hour (site said 15 minutes), she had to transfer me to someone else and it would take 5 minutes. I gave up after an hour and tried again. This time I put in the info, for the right person to call me that can fix the issues with case number **. My problem is that I cannot uncheck a box on the software. I searched online and I guess there are many people with the same problem. With my time on hold now, I am seeking sites to post my issues with turbo tax. Maybe I can save someone hours and hours of wasted time next year by buying any other tax software other than turbo tax... My phone is beeping now, the battery is going out.
Required upgrade from last year, process to refund within the program didn't happen. Multiple attempts to contact and submit information for the refund have been unsuccessful and have used turbotax for the last 6 years. Basic bait and switch operation!
This year I sold my residence (issue 1) and, for the 6th year straight had to file with foreign earnings and taxes (issue 2). Turbotax returned errors when there weren't (preventing e-filing) and wouldn't populate other necessary fields. I had help requests in for several weeks with no response. I have now filed for an extension and am looking for other software to do my return. I have used TT for 15+ years and have watched quality worsen every year...no more, never again.
My taxes were rejected 4 times, mainly because the Feds do not tell a citizen WHY the returns are being rejected. We don't know where to look for the problem. IT SHOULD BE A LAW THAT THE TAX PEOPLE CAN NOT REJECT A RETURN UNLESS THEY TELL THE CITIZEN WHERE THE PROBLEM LIES. I spent two hours with a very polite, patient, and knowledgeable tax pro. She and I did a lot of guesswork to no avail, refiling only to be rejected again. Finally, I voiced a problem with answering their questions about the W-2 boxes. She immediately saw the problem! I am retired and filling out a W-2. :( How stupid of me. My bad. The TurboTax software was not able to find the error because it did not simply look at my work status as RETIRED and then ask me why I am not using a 1099-R. Insufficient error checking, in my opinion. I had no problem getting the "free" filing from them and was told up front that I would. The TurboTax software was otherwise basically easy to use, but I will let a tax man do my returns from now on. It took too long to go with the e-file method, and I feel that a one-on-one session with a human will ultimately be faster and more accurate, using his/her expert skills to prevent any of my ignorant answers.
TurboTax took my money for my state form, then the website wouldn't send it electronically. There was "something wrong" with my federal form and when I would click to "fix it" it just said I would have to file by mail. When I clicked to "file by mail", it just took me back to the page that said there was "something wrong". So, I could neither file electronically or print the form. Basically screwed out of 31 bucks and wasted a whole evening! Then I had to take all my stuff the next day to H&R Block - decent people, thank God. Of course there is no way to contact TurboTax to complain either. These are thieves that know their stuff.
I logged into TurboTax on April 14th to finally do my taxes only to discover that someone had filed taxes under my name in late December or early January. I called in and spoke to security who blamed MY apple computer which has never had a virus (she assumed I had a PC) and then said there was no way anyone could access TurboTax without my e-mail. And then she said that someone changed the e-mail address inside the account. Then she gave me information on what to do to report it to the IRS and they closed the case. I called back the next day on the 15th to get the e-mail address that was used and they refused to give it to me. I asked for auditing assistance if the IRS contacts me, or any sort of assistance, and they said NO. I then got off and focused on getting my taxes done. So today on April 17, I tried to log back in and now TurboTax deleted my entire account! I am on hold right now to speak to their security team. I read article after article that TurboTax has been compromised and has affected thousands of users. I also believe that TurboTax is leaving their customers out to hang on this. I personally know of 4 people that this affected in my little town and I'm an introvert! My teenager's social security number was also on the form which means that her number was compromised and she hasn't even used her number for anything really! What a way to start her life with identity fraud! It makes me feel as if someone within TurboTax must've filed false claims and now they are covering up their tracks! I do not believe that this was a foreign gang who hacked their site! I believe TurboTax has ruined a lot of people with this and as someone who used them for the last 3 years, I have to say that I am incredibly disappointed in their response and I highly, highly, highly recommend that you go into a an actual tax preparer going forward! Do not, I repeat, DO NOT use an online tax service like TurboTax! Avoid online tax preparation services like the plague. Yes, it's cheaper. Yes, it's convenient. But realize that there's a reason it's cheaper.
I have used TurboTax for many years - the online version. Never had a problem until this year while trying to file my 2014 tax year information. I could not get online -- I tried my new computer and they gave me many codes to use, which always expired within seconds. Trying to find a live body is "a task". What happened? After so many years - where is the quality of service they used to have? I am really now afraid to input my data and I now have to find a new source. What a letdown.
I want to begin by saying that over the years I haven't had any issues. 2014 I filed and when it prompted for payment of 150.75 I entered my debit card and got a red lettered error message stating that the transaction was denied by my financial institution. I tried again 2 more times figuring that perhaps I typed the numbers incorrectly. I was then prompted and had no other choice but to take the 2nd option of paying 29.99 more to have the payment taken directly from my return. Next day all transaction were put through on my debit card. I called the bank. The bank needed only a fax or email from Turbo tax to remove the fraudulent charges. I spent the entire day on the phone getting the run around from turbo tax and it's 2 days later the 3 extra charges of 150.75 are still on my account. Turbo Tax felt that within a week it would be resolved. I know they could have resolved it that day but refused. They wasted more money paying tech support than just sending a fax or email. Very poor customer service. I was transferred around..put on hold all day long till about 4pm. No resolution and my auto draft payments in my accounts will be returned adding bank fees. Get with it Turbo Tax.
I just attempted to file, for the first time, with TurboTax. What a disaster!!!! TurboTax couldn't seem to grasp that I am a salaried employee who gets performance bonuses via a pre-tax HSA contribution, and via a pre-tax SEP-IRA contribution. It wanted me to file as an independent contractor, which is wrong. Then it gave me only a $100 deduction, for a $4,200 pre-tax HSA contribution, and a deduction of only 1/3 of my pre-tax SEP-IRA contribution. One entry, that should have taken 5 minutes, took almost 5 hours! Maybe this website works for very basic tax returns, but nothing more. I wound up filing for an extension, & paying an outrageously wrong tax bill, so that I could hire a live person to re-do. Apparently the "Customer Support" consists of reading other people's reviews, no LIVE person. Then when I tried to print my unfiled return, to show an accountant, they tried to charge me $54.99!!! The link I clicked on was for a FREE Federal return!!! Never again!!! (And no you can't apply here, this wonderful job is all mine! LOL!)
Completed my taxes and got to the part to "e-file". Since I was filing a state return, I had to pay ($24.95). This is where the problem arose. You have to log into the Intuit online store (which I've done in the past for my previous returns). I could not do it this time due to Java issues with script (according to intuit). Apparently they thought that there be issues, as there was a link for help if you could not log in to their store. So I called the number, it's automated and not set up specifically for this problem. After a few minutes of trying to get to the store, I finally resorted to the "press 0 a bunch of times" to get to a person to route me to the proper location. Hardly. After being on hold for a while, I get another automated message that they will call me back so I don't have to wait on line. Sounds good. So I hang up, e-file my federal return on line (it's free), and wait for the return call. After an hour, I figured my return call was lost so I printed out the state form, packaged it up and was headed for the Post Office to send it when literally seconds before I walked out the door, I got the return call. Seems all calls go to general support, so I had to wait for people wanting technical and filing info. All I needed was to pay and get a code to insert in the software. She was nice and explained that they were having problems and were trying to fix it (on the 15th). Needless to say I mailed it at the Post Office. Actually, the Post Office was closed by this time, but I used one of the automated machines in the lobby which printed out the postage label, which included the time/date (prior to midnight). So, why were they still trying to fix Java problems on the 15th, and more important, why not a dedicated line to call to pay and get an "submittal" code (take 1-2 minutes per call)?
Buyer beware: TurboTax Federal Free Edition charged me $31.79 to file my state tax but due to tech errors which I tried to call and fix (they were unable to) my state tax did not get filed. They still charged me and would not give me a refund. They said the charge is for preparing the state form and it didn't matter that I could not file it. Terrible program and their customer service is not well informed. H&R Block online software was so much better and free. I will never use TurboTax again.
We have been TurboTax customers for many years. I am extremely disappointed at the tactic used this year. After keying information and hours of working on our return, I was told by the system we had to upgrade to a $109 Home & Business program! Plus pay $39 for each state return we filed. I will NOT use TurboTax next year. Also, return could not be reviewed without keying in payment information first. I will research H&R Block software programs next year. Had I known of these TurboTax changes prior to starting my return, I would not have used TurboTax.
I signed in w/o acct... SD I had acct. Then I signed in, code process. Did not shut down browser. Went to email 6 different times, got code. Went back to page, said every time code expired... no way. Then I tried saying forgot password etc. Put in name, dob, SSN, etc. said no match 6 times. Sign in again... no acct. I wasted 4 hours and did not get to file. I am simply disgusted. I followed all instructions on help info. Won't do this again.
At the end of the whole "free" process, they will basically make you decide if you just wasted the last few (or more) hours of your life entering info into their system and want to start from scratch, or pay for their "deluxe" package and have them file. Will never use them again.
I have used TurboTax for years with no issue, because I never needed customer service before. I will NEVER use them again. One simple issue and no one can help. I've been on the phone for 45 minutes and have been transferred but no one has the answer. They don't know why I don't have the option to delete my return and start over again. How is this even possible? How can such a large company NOT HAVE ENOUGH KNOWLEDGEABLE REPRESENTATIVES at TAX TIME???
I went to sign into the TurboTax website, got my password and ended up not being able to sign in AFTER having verified the correct password. It gets pretty frustrating when the system locks me out AND I CANNOT SPEAK WITH A LIVE PERSON TO GET MY ANSWERS.
They change the account number from my bank account number and put their account number and took my entire tax which was sent out to them February 9th. And I just found out April 15th but they have taken my entire tax and now they're telling me they sent it back to IRS which is not true.
100% of my 1099R NY Withholding is being calculated (by Turbo Tax) to be 100% refundable. TurboTax Error Message says "when E-Filing, 1099R withholding amount cannot equal refund amount." Error must be fixed before E-Filing. I'm at a full stop without a hint as to how to fix this problem. Program is no help. Tried to contact TurboTax for help without success. NY State requires an E-File...it's the law.
Because TurboTax advertised a free online tax experience, I spent 2 hours filling out all the forms. I am 81, retired, and have less than $12,000 a year in income. At the very end I was told I would have to pay $54.95 for their federal service and an addition $30.00 for the state service, all because I got a $350.00 distribution from an IRA. That is not an unusual or complicated tax issue. They were hoping that I would not want to have wasted my time and would pay up but they misjudged me. I used H&R Block online which provided a free federal return and a minimal charge for the state. It was faster and much more user friendly. All companies have the right to charge what they want for their service but telling you it is free and then changing the rules at the end of the transaction is not right. Intuit should consider bring in some people to review their ethics and business practices keeping in mind the fact that the country can survive quite well without them.
Trying to process simple federal and Michigan tax returns. I spent 10 hours total of which an Intuit rep was on the phone with me for 3 hours yesterday. Though gracious and polite, she had to leave for advice several times. Downloaded a new 2014 over the internet since the disc I bought wouldn't allow me to file and when that also failed offered not to charge me for the downloads. It's showing two "script errors" which no one is able to correct and you cannot correct these on your own and cannot file a tax return. She said that they were have problems with the system going up and down. That is not the case is one checks out what the script errors actually are. They refer back to 2013 returns either in my system or in their systems. Now I also paid the credit card fee I will have to get back since I am unable to process the Michigan return, Yes, they took, the money, BEFORE it got "filed". Now I am on my way to Costco to return this obviously defective product. No offers from Intuit on case #**. Great, huh?
I have 2 complaints. I fought through, but I had to use workarounds to do it. I filed for my deceased parents. The program said I did not need to file Form 1310. BUT there are no instructions on how to sign the 1040. I put "deceased" plus their DOD and signed my name on each signature line. I have my fingers crossed that the return is not rejected. Also you cannot add a Third Party Designatee without going into forms mode and entering the info on a worksheet. I also filed their state return. The form signature lines were filled in correctly. Bizarre! Investment income - OMG where do I start. I had to purchase the Premium upgrade for $30 for $64 in income. I filled in the interview and only page 2 of Form 8949 printed. I had to go to the IRS site to print page 1.
Website is misleading. I opted to pay for my state filing using my tax refund. An additional service, TurboTax Plus was tacked on. I repeatedly (nearly an hour) tried to remove this extra 30.00 fee. From searching the site for answers I saw that other users had had the same issue. Customer support provided instructions, but they did not work -- there is no "Removal link." The website is designed to trap customers. Some users had suggested paying by credit card rather than by refund as a way to remove this tacked on bonus service. I tried this. It did not work. All that happened was that I was charged for my state filing AND the TurboTax Plus before I even got close to transmitting my taxes. Very shady company. Extremely offensive company.
Should have been free Federal tax filing and $40 for State. Claimed I needed special forms & charged me $40 for Federal. Then they claimed my debit card was not recognized - brand new card - and charged me $40 more to take fees directly from my federal tax refund.
We have filed using TurboTax for several years. This year we filed the first day allowed. My wife's SSN had already been used. We were told by IRS to call back if it wasn't in our account by April. We called back and were told it could still be another 6 months. We were hoping to use the refund for a early summer vacation. Now it looks like we won't be able to at all this year.
I was overcharged while using them! They do not clearly state that they are charging you for certain services. When I called to confront them, they said it was not their fault. I tried to tell them they should clearly state that they will charge for the service. This is the 2nd year they have done this. I would NEVER suggest TurboTax to anyone ever. Worst experience ever. They deserve no stars.
I used TurboTax software for tax year 2013. The software added my social security paid to my wife's social security paid and then subtracted the $7049 the IRS says is the maximum social security amount and said the subtracted amount was what I overpaid. Obviously this is not correct because it's calculated individually not together. Now I have a $3610 tax bill thanks to TurboTax.
I purchased TurboTax Deluxe 2014 dvd. The cover states "Federal Returns & Federal E-File plus State Returns". When I completed my Penna State return and went to file I had to pay an additional $24.99. to complete. Based on the cover I assumed the e-file was included. Since all my data had already been entered and it was (April 13th my fault there) TT seems to nickel and dime you after buy their software. This is the last time for them. I switch to H&R Block software going forward.
I don't mind the cost but the software bugs and endless loops are ridiculous!!!
This software promises free federal e-file and 1 free state e-file, by the time I wrestled through my complex return it was 4/14. I went to file and it demanded a fee to file my state return. Apparently the fine print says you must file by 2/16 to get a no charge state e-file, it cost me 22.00 and it cost an additional 20.02 to pay my federal bill with a credit card, I can understand a fee for credit processing. These guys should be in the payday loan business, they charged me 2.5% then effectively added 50% to what I thought I paid for the product. I will not use them again. 10 years solid - I am done. They are thieves and liars.
Turbo tax would not accept my visa during the filing process and said the info was entered wrong 3 times, well.... it wasn't entered wrong and on the 4th time it worked. And it turns out they charged my visa 4 times at a total of $579.92!!! I am awaiting response from turbo tax about if/when they will refund my money. Meanwhile I will be going down to my bank to file fraud since I have no money to buy anything right now due to the charges, not even gas. Thanks turbo tax.. what a ** joke... Although I must say I did like turbo tax right up to that point. I like their system, and their software was very helpful. But their money taking process is beyond worthless. I better getting my money back!!! That's all I have to say.
I was very careful not to get the TurboTax PLUS fee, but somehow I got it anyway and was charged near $60 to do my taxes. I'm a student and do not make much money, so this is a substantial amount for me. If I would have known I would have been charged that much there is no way I would have used this service. Also, I called customer service and they told me that there was no way to get it refunded even though I was not receiving any of the perks that came with the PLUS account. All because hidden somewhere I clicked a button apparently that wasn't well labeled. I do not like being taken advantage of and have heard that many people are having problems with TurboTax feeing them extra this year. Not impressed at all.
Intuit charges you $55 for the Deluxe edition. The Deluxe edition, not living up to it's name, does not include state tax preparation. So they charge another $40 for the State: California edition. Then, out of nowhere, the receipt for your payment includes "Refund Processing Service and TurboTax Premium Service". Total bill $134.97. I could have had an accountant at HR Block prepare it for me for less than that! Last time, Turbo Tax! I have cross-checked your returns with shareware sites and gotten the same results. Next year, that is where I will be.
I've waited hours and hours for an representing to answer very important questions concerning my taxes and got hung up numerous times. Mind you, I'm paying for this service, very unprofessional. Will not use ever again. Very unhappy customer.
I have been a TurboTax user for years. This year when I tried to file I was not given an option to print my state return and file by mail. Why would I spend $39.99 to get a $12 refund? It is very hard to navigate and was not that way in past years. When purchased it claimed free federal and state e-file. It also stated I could file up to five returns. I was not able to. If I was then it was not as easy to locate and use as before. I will not be using Turbo tax next year.
Been using TT for couple years. The fact that they string you along, making you input all your info only to tell you at the end that in order to use all your data, you gotta upgrade or start from scratch. Unethical in my opinion, and misleading!!!
It only took a decade for Turbo Tax to lose me as a positive advocate and user. For over ten years, I had peace of mind knowing the latest tax laws were incorporated into the process, I could readily access any form; and with a click of a button, I could instantly submit my tax returns electronically. That was until today, when I discovered my tax return was rejected because it had already been submitted by someone else back in December. So Turbo Tax charged me to access and print off all of my documents, and says no data been compromised. Having to drive in traffic to buy a case of paper and extra ink, in order to print off hundreds of pages of documents, mail them, wait 6-8 weeks for processing, and add another 180 days to sort out the identity theft; just isn't worth the hassle. Next year, even if Turbo Tax gets their act together, I'll be using anything but Turbo Tax to process my tax return. Way to go Turbo Tax!
Turbo Tax Intuit wasted my time, was inaccurate and confusing, and kept adding fees. Completely Unsatisfied.
My son filed his Fed 2014 (for free) and the State with Turbo Tax and they charged him $60.00 for filing the state form even though it was rejected twice by the state. $60.00?!?!?!! for filing state, when you take into consideration that my son could have used TaxAct which would have been a lot cheaper! Turbo tax should disclose the state filing fees up front so that customers will know up front what their 'outrageous' fees are so that they may make a decision about 'declining' or accepting that insane, unethical, outrageous fee!! AS FOR ME I WOULD 'NEVER' RECOMMEND TURBO TAX TO ANYONE--NO REFERRALS. THEY ARE DISHONEST AND THEIR FEES ARE UNREASONABLE!! DON'T USE TURBO TAX UNLESS YOU LIKE BEING TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF!!
I filed my 2013 taxes last year using TurboTax Deluxe. This year I had to use TurboTax Premier. In an e-mail dated February 5, 2015 from the General Manager, they have a $25 cash back program. When applying for the rebate, I was denied because they needed to verify my eligibility. There is no real customer support only FAQs. I did a post on my account and was given a number to call. I called the number only to be transferred to 4 different people with the total call lasting ONE HOUR AND 50 MINUTES so far. Every time I was transferred I was assured I was being transferred to someone who could assist me. I feel as though they make you wait and transfer you every employee they have hope that you'll get disgusted and give up. This program seems like a SCAM! I will not be using TurboTax ever because of its false promises and terrible customer service.
I have used Turbo Tax for many years, no problems. I always file a pretty basic EZ1040 as I have very few deductions. This year Turbo Tax jumped the shark it seems. This is the first year I decided I would try Efile (I have always previously mailed hard copies). I bought the Home/Business Turbo Tax disc at Costco for $39.99. When I got to the efiling section Turbo Tax wants to charge me $24 for a Calif Efile PLUS another $39 to deduct that $24 from my refund (which is only $101.00 btw). So using TT for a return is basically $104.00 now? Really? I backed out and printed my returns again and will hard copy file again this year. And next year I will NOT be buying Turbo Tax again.
I have used TurboTax for many years to prepare our taxes. I will never use TurboTax again and certainly not recommend TurboTax to anyone! I tried to file my 2014 Federal and State tax return and it looks like someone already did it for me and enjoying my refund! TurboTax doesn't offer any assistance with this. Now I'm trying to get help through the IRS... that should be quick!
Unable to efile state taxes. Senior citizens in states where taxes are paid on gross income as opposed to net income are usually required to file state tax forms when federal is not required. This year, TurboTax will not efile state if federal has not been filed requiring everything to be sent hard copy.
TurboTax charged me to perform an E-File of my IL. State tax return. But then after making the payment I was informed that I had to do it by mail. Why wasn't the final check performed BEFORE payment was required? I want my money back! When I looked for contact information all I got was FAQ answers. I have been using TurboTax for five years. After this I am going to look for a different way to do my taxes next year.
I've used TurboTax for many years and had been very happy with them. After completing my returns, and paying the $24.99 to e-file my state taxes, I get the message that my transmission did not go through and that I may have lost internet connection (I did not). I did the troubleshooting on the TurboTax website and followed all the instructions, including putting Internet Explorer back on my computer. Finally, after hours of trying to e-file my taxes, I find out that since I have an older version of XP and Internet Explorer, I cannot e-file from my very functional, but older desktop computer because I do not have a newer version of Windows and Explorer. So now I am not only out the $24.99 I paid to e-file my state taxes, but I also no longer qualify for the additional Amazon 10% refund bonus, plus I have to print everything out and mail all the supporting documentation.
This year I was able to do my taxes quicker than previous years. However, in previous years, I was never forced to pay for both Federal and State taxes. I was given the option to print out my state and manually send. I also was forced by answering a certain question to upgrade to the more expensive Deluxe version. I was hoping to do free this year since I had so little work this year. HUGE disappointment with this company. I was always proud of being able to do them myself with the help of the software. But the last few years, the company has gotten, well, GREEDY! I cannot recommend them to anyone, with good conscience.
I was quite angry with Turbo Tax because I was charged for filing my federal taxes when I wanted to just do the free option for federal and I never accepted any of their offers to upgrade and pay for filing. I wrote about this on my Twitter account as well, and surprisingly a customer service rep responded almost immediately. By the next day, they told me that they were issuing me a refund for the amount that I was mistakenly charged. I was very impressed with their customer service and would recommend them to others after seeing how they dealt with my complaint.
For nearly 20 years I have done my taxes the same way -- go to Walmart, buy TurboTax Deluxe, fill out, file, done. This year I did the same but when I get to part "fill out" TurboTax tells me it will cost an additional $59.95. So I take it back to Walmart and tell them I want my money back. They tell me they can't give me my money back because I open the package. So now I am stuck with a short form that cost me $64.00. How can these two giants get away with this fraud? What cost me $54 last year will cost $124 this year. For those who can do math, that is over a 100% increase. THIEVES!!!
Bad enough that they charge 39.95 for an extra state tax program, but then to charge 24 to e-file is a bit of a ripoff. The software should include everything at that 39.95 price.
Bought Turbo Tax Basic every year for the last 6 years. This year it won't itemize my deductions unless I spend an additional $40 to upgrade to the deluxe version. I hate these kinds of bait and switches. Last time I buy Turbo Tax.
Turbo tax changed the input. I just filed and I read my printout and where there was supposed to be a # in added .00 to it. Which makes my input be 800 turned out to be 80000.00. Can’t get it back. Wow. Let’s see what happens from here.
Was helping my daughter file her taxes and used TurboTax after they claimed it would be free if her AGI was less than $31K, which it was. They ended up charging me $59.95 to file her taxes and force you to upgrade to premium packages at the very end after you spend a considerable amount of time entering all of the information, all under the original idea that this is going to be a free service. There is no help screen or customer service or anything you can do about this, so I reluctantly paid the fee. Also, some of the forms for unreimbursed job expenses asked that I make an edit to one of the selections. When I tried, I was unable to do so - it was an endless loop. Again, no customer service or help to rely on. I will definitely find another solution next year.
I bought TurboTax from Sam's the past three years to do my 1040. They always had the schedules to complete the form. This year I would have to pay $30 to get the one form that I needed because they changed the way they do forms. Could not return. RIP-OFF.
I filed my tax return 02/08/2015 using Turbotax, asking to put a portion of my refund into my Amazon gift account. Now over 2 months later, the money is nowhere. I did, however, received my specified refund portion into my bank account 02/18/2015. I found via the IRS refund web that all my refund was paid on the same date. So where is the rest of the refund? I made inquiries via Turbotax twice but no response, though I saw many people were asking the same question. I called Turbotax customer service, a rep asked me to wait, after a long time as she's checking into my situation, and then she told me to check my email, which I've been doing daily and found nothing. She asked me to wait again and about 10 minutes later, someone disconnected the call. So I called again, waiting for 40+ minutes but no answer, with only noisy music and ads announcements. I further filled a Turbotax survey to complain about this. I'd file formal complaints to regulators and talk to my attorney, if not get the response by the end of April. Please contact me if you have the same problem with Turbotax refunds, let's work together on it.
If any of you were smart you wouldn't use TurboTax to prepare your taxes. They hire any and everybody for their wah (work at home) call center. They don't do drug screens, or real interviews. They train you from a computer. This is why their agents are so lost when you call for info. Half the info you ask for they don't know it, but are these the individuals you want pulling up your info? All I have left to say is if you have any problems with the software and you need an agent please let them know you don't feel comfortable giving it over the phone because its not protected.
The website for TurboTax does not have an intuitive place to go to complain. This is why I'm complaining here. The only customer service option is a call from a CPA? I'm guessing the supposed Fraud is actually a ploy to hide the fact that a programmer took the values from the wrong W2 value and move it to the state tax filing. I received a letter from the state correcting the error and showing that TurboTax had a false filing I was getting a state refund according to TurboTax. I'm surprised this was not corrected during testing. They should own it and add a positive spin about the fact we are all human.
This is infuriating. First of all, they charge you around $60 to get ANY deductions (this should automatically be included). On top of that, I go through this (extremely) long process of filling out my state tax documentation and then at the end of it, after filling it all out, they say that I must pay another $40 to actually file it! The only other option is to DELETE everything I input and file it manually by going to the state's website, printing out the documentation and filling it out by hand. I am absolutely disgusted with this corrupt business. I will never use them again.
Promised 20% reduction but charged full price. Never acknowledged my complaint. See that this year the same promise - once bitten, twice shy. Lack of response main complaint.
After doing my taxes for the third year with turbo tax, for the same service it was $25.00 more and they did not specify it until I had already paid for it. I was very unsatisfied. If had known this I would have gone somewhere else. I felt like it was a scam because they should have stated this when I started my taxes. I think it's wrong and I will no longer use turbo tax again. I would not recommend turbo tax to anyone.
Just wanted to voice my displeasure with Intuit. I have used Quicken since it was first introduced and have, for the most part, used TurboTax for my taxes for many years. Between their price increase while stripping select forms with no acknowledgement, and imposing price increase in the middle of filing season deadline and you have a classic example of a business model case study regarding what not to do. Frankly, both products have their brightest days behind them. Quicken has definitely suffered with upgrades that have amounted to arranging deck chairs on a sinking ship.
I've used TurboTax for the first time. They advertised “use it for free” but when I want to efile I was asked to pay and I called them and I told them “I don't remember I subscribed to the deluxe”. I did not want to efile it with ridiculous charge. I called them and told me that she will take the payment on the phone and then I can efile it for $29.99. So she instructed me to click on download button I can't find on the online screen. I called back because I didn't get my refund yet and the lady told me that since I use TurboTax even though I didn't efile it I am still going to be charged and she said it is their policy not to refund the charge. Their advertisement is misleading. I should have just used Taxact for free.
I had gone to H&R block for my taxes. Because I had medical bills and had bought a house, I thought I could get the maximum deductions from them. She worked 45minutes on the taxes. Very few deductions and I was getting back about $50.00. She charged me $300,00. I went online to TurboTax, not knowing if I was going to improve my tax outlook. Once I had signed in and started I could see how my deductions were adding up by looking at the upper right side of the screen. It took me about 3 1/2 hours to do. It was well worth it. I was getting a large refund from federal and less to pay into state. TurboTax charged me much less for their services. They estimated when I would receive the refund, and I did receive as they had said.
The IRS wouldn't allow my taxes to be filed electronically because my DOB is wrong in their system. TurboTax briefly instructed me to mail my w2 along with my 1040. It took FOUR weeks for a reply from the IRS telling me I did not submit the correct forms therefore I have to wait ANOTHER 6-8 weeks. I won't see my refund until May when I filed in February. Thanks TurboTax!
Turbotax plus.. I have been using TurboTax for quite a few years and I must say that though I like the software, I sure HATE the manipulation of fees! If you click or fail to uncheck a button, because of their deceptive descriptions or lack of, then you get charged additional fees! All I can say IS buyer beware!!! After this year, I may not utilize the service again.
Last evening I was on the phone with TurboTax for over an hour trying to figure out why my 2013 business expense are not coming across in the transfer to begin my 2014 return. After 1 hour I was disconnect from the rep as she was needing additional help. Now tonight I have been on the phone with them again for 2 1/2 hours, 3 representatives that dialed into my computer... NO RESOLUTION. Now they have to transfer me to tech support. I have been on hold for 45 minutes now for tech support! Are you kidding me... I could have manual typed in all of last year's information but OH WAIT. If I type in last year's information I can't file electronically per TurboTax. I have used them for the past 5 years but never again!
*WARNING* do not use Turbo Tax 2014 if you have a computer older than 2007. You will not be able to use the disc. They SCREWED up big time and I am extremely upset at their product. PS the phone customer service was horrendous and not compassionate.
I use turbo tax every year. Turbo tax 2015 won't accept or go beyond the page to add credit card for fee and tax payment. Won't accept audit defense credit card either. I'll have to print and mail my return.
Somewhere some moron at TurboTax decided "Hey, let's tell people it's free and then charge them at the end of the hours long process!" Brilliant. TurboTax used to be a great product. Reasonably priced, easy to use. Now they gouge you on every turn. God forbid you have deduction and maybe even a small side business. You will pay the maximum amount possible. You SUCK TurboTax!
Turbotax now charging an EXTRA $39.95 to fill out State forms... I cannot even bring up the State Forms without being directed to online link that asks me to pay ANOTHER $39.95 to go on???
TurboTax has violated so many laws with my tax return, I've been forced to file a lawsuit against them. My tax return was a simple 1099-MISC for a measly 4,000 dollars. When I first filed my return, TurboTax fraudulently stole $95 from me, disguising their payment method within the interface. In other words, they affirmatively represent that you are merely paying for the IRS tax return, but instead you get hit with a receipt (with NO confirmation) that you just bought the expensive deluxe TurboTax package. Their fraudulent scheme is so apparent with how quick they were to refund me that money once I complained - they know what they're doing. Next, my taxes were rejected, because I needed to claim myself as a dependent - this was a mistake of my own. However, TurboTax took the $295 that I submitted through them for the IRS, even though my taxes were rejected! When I called the IRS, they said they did not have the money. I called TurboTax and spoke with 3 different customer service reps. These are some of the most incompetent employees you will ever speak with. They sound like high school students when you speak with them. How much did you know about taxes in high school? Probably next to nothing. Their reps gave me false promises, completely incorrect help, and after speaking with the IRS, LIES. The IRS doesn't have my money, the TurboTax reps have given me wrong information consistently (one rep even telling me that even though my taxes were rejected, the IRS still has my money and TurboTax does not - this was a pathetic lie or attempt or failed attempt to sound competent). Finally, when I went to make my change, my taxes owed jumped from $295 (which I had already paid originally) to $1,100!!!! In other words their system is completely flawed. I ended up having to speak with an accountant for a pathetic $4,000 income, and they told me there is no way I should owe $1,100 dollar for a total income of $4,000. I even phones TurboTax AGAIN to ask them about this jump, and the representative told me that it makes sense that I should owe that much. Really? The federal government charges over 25% taxes for someone who is over $10,000 below the poverty line? Their representatives or complete ignoramuses! They have stolen my money on more than one occasion. TurboTax needs to be held accountable for what it has done to me. Did I mention their software arbitrarily, and unilaterally added $1,000 to my adjusted gross income? And their reps could not help me change this???? Unbelievable.
I rarely leave online reviews or comments, but was compelled to after using TurboTax to prepare my 2014 taxes. A simple W2 & 1099-R. TurboTax was about to charge me $150 total to use their service. On top of their fed & state charges, they added an additional $54.99 since applying my 1099-R made it a "complex" return. Absolute rubbish. I decided to check TaxAct before finalizing my returns with Turbo. Glad I did. Was around $40 total.
It seems that TurboTax has decided that they can make more money by hiding the fees you will be paying for their service until you get to the check-out --- AFTER you've filed. Then when you call their customer service, they tell you their fees are not hidden, but included in the permission form you completed -- you know, that long long form you scroll through without reading because you assume it's standard legalese. I will be researching a different (reliable and transparent) product next tax season.
I made a mistake on initial tax return when I amended by only changing one number by $800.00, my return went from refund of over $4000.00 to owing $162.00. Transferred to tech support and still on hold for 45 minutes.
I am/was a long time user of TurboTax. This year I had to purchase the Premier program b/c of some small investment accounts & need to report 1099B & 1099DIV info. This program was glitched up with bugs that I kept crashing when it came time to enter 1099B & 1099DIV info. My computer just had a thorough cleaning & optimization by my tech support people. My broker had provided me with .txf files for the data xfer into TT. I contacted the TT Help Line and they walked me thru de-install & re-install of the program. Ran the new program and it stated there were 100+ issues to correct on the 1099B data... a missing transaction code. The Help Line knew a lot about computers but nothing about tax code. The broker stated not all transactions needed a code & the data is correct. I verified it in reviewing the IRS online info for 1099Bs.The TT program is insistent that I enter a valid code for the 100+ transactions before it will allow e-filing & printing my returns. I am dumping this P.O.S. program. It's worthless. And every year for the past 5 Intuit has increased the prices. AND I had to pay an additional $25.00 to efile in my state and I can not do that as the program will not allow the data to be filed. They are a rip off! I can no longer trust them.
I have used Turbo Tax Online for the past 4 years. This year, the service automatically locked me into using their deluxe version, and I was unable to go back to basic. At the end of the process, my fee was 1/3 of my return, and considering that I only got back a few hundred dollars this time, I'm really angered by their deceptive tactics that robbed me of making my own choice for which service I wanted to use. My fee was double what it was last year, and my return was smaller, so I really feel cheated! This is unfair and takes advantage of people who have faithfully used their service in the past.
I have for the past 10 years used TurboTax software. This year was no different except they required me to upgrade to Premier in one input section of their software for free. It did not work so I had to call customer service. After some time they gave me a code which upgraded me to Premier. I then got into the business section and they said I needed to upgrade to Home and Business. Again this did not work so I called customer service again. They did not know or care about the problems I been having. In fact I got dropped and no one called me back. I found out later they have no way to call you back. I called again and work with a person for 3 hours. IT got involved (could not talk with them). Finally after 3 times uninstalling and installing of the software I got Home and Business. I lost my free state software and the free filing that came with the Deluxe version. I finally gave up and demanded two things. My money back from my purchase for the Deluxe software which they said I would get after pushing very hard to get it (we will see). The other was to talk with a supervisor which I never achieved. TurboTax was good at one time. I would not recommend it to anyone in the future. Sad to see these companies move away from good customer service.
Your software has a glitch and it took me about 15 hours of phone calls, entering data again, and again, and again, trying to find the best work-around. Your people were NICE and sometimes helpful...not always. Eventually we figured it out. But it shouldn't have taken 15 hours AND you should fix the software once you know the glitch exists. Glitch: When you entered a 1099-G, agricultural payments, and link it to your schedule F Farm -- there is NO place to indicate these payments are taxable. In the review the question comes up -- but the number that is typed into the review box is NOT the number that shows up on the schedule F line 4b (it does some calculation that is not relevant). The fix for me was to download the desktop version and hard-code the data. This was AFTER your help desk people told me to delete schedule F -- so I lost all the historical data relating to assets and depreciation. It was a nightmare re-keying all that info back in. I've used TurboTax for years -- but this was too big of an issue for me to overcome. I will not be a return customer. BTW -- you refunded me 100% of the cost of the software for other issues that I encountered in February (couldn't get access for no apparent reason). So there's nothing you can do for me unless you want to just give me money!!
My wife and I just completed out federal and state taxes today, 04/05/15. I can understand that "free" does not actually mean "free" however TurboTax and intuit have really pushed me over the edge this time. I can understand fee of say $35.00 but these guys continued to up the fees from $34.99 to adding $54.99!!! That was bad enough however at the very end just before filing ANOTHER FEE OF $39.99 was added!!! Almost $130.00 WHAT THE??? In order to change these additions, we would have to clear everything and start over COMPLETELY!!! Between The Health Care market place and Intuit We feel COMPLETELY VIOLATED. I will never use your extortion/tax preparation services again!!! I will vigorously advise against your services. GREED will kill us all. Thanks from two hardworking people with a small child to support.
I just did my 2014 taxes using the online version. The thieves at TurboTax forced me to upgrade to Premium only because I had investments in the stock market! Their bill after 20 & discount from my broker came to $64.99 USD!!! That was not enough for them but they added extra state taxes to it making it $70.35 USD!!! Total rip off! Next year, I am going with TaxAct.com.
I needed help in amending prior year taxes, and they put you thru the ringer trying to speak to someone who actually knows anything about taxes. They are all just repeating phrases they have been taught to say, and have no actual knowledge. Also, I was told a 'tax specialist' would call me on a particular day, but never got that call. 5 days later, a rep told me, after 35 minutes, that she could not put me thru to someone who knew anything unless I bought their audit protection. Finally, she transferred me to a specialist, but it was just a voicemail. I called back, the next specialist basically said a lot of reps don't know anything, and of course I could talk to a tax specialist, and now I am waiting on the phone 26 minutes so far. Get my drift? I imagine either they have no specialist (even though they advertise that they do) or reps are told not to pass calls thru. Either way, for what I thought was a respected company, I am feeling like I'm being scammed. BTW, my call has now gone to vm again. :(
Because TurboTax advertised a free online simple tax experience, we spent 1 to 2 hours filling out all the forms. At the very end we were told we would have to pay over 50 dollars for their service. Clearly they were hoping that we would not want to have wasted our time and would fork over the money. We did not. We went to another online service offering a free return. It was faster. In our view it was more accurate. AND they did not get to the end and demand money! We will NEVER use TurboTax again.
Issue was resolved when I finally got through to tech support. But gave the company less than 5 stars because I felt I was taken advantage of with the state return; it would have been free to file electronically on my own, but I paid the additional $25 for the California filing because I felt uneasy about disputing what was already programmed. I will not be using Turbotax again, as it generated lots of unnecessary paperwork and I can see that it is easier to file by hand on my own the federal return, and electronically the state.
For the same basic tax information and equal service requirement I was charged $20 ($34.99 vs $54.99) more this year than last. This is more than a 50% increase. After a complaint my charge was reduced by $10. I was told that next year I must pay the new rate. There will be no next year. I will use another service.
We have been using Turbo Tax ("TT") since 1998. We do have a small business requiring Sch C and investment in stocks. In the past the TT Deluxe version had always been adequate to handle our return. In 2014, we have very few stock transactions and the small business is winding down. However, when we did our return (using TT Deluxe), it forced us to upgrade to Premier when we tried to input the sale of 3 stocks; as we half-way done with the return plus our long history with TT, we obliged and paid an additional $30. We then proceeded to enter information for our small business, TT lets you enter some of the information, but half way in the process, it prompts you to upgrade to "Home & Business" for another $10! If anything, our 2014 return is much simpler than prior years. In prior years we had pages upon pages of stock sales. We had home-office deduction, depreciation ... for the small business; and we were able to do the return on the Deluxe version! But this year we are forced to upgrade upon another upgrade to complete the return. Businesses succeed in improving their products to please existing customers and attract new customers. Whoever at TT thought of this tactic to increase revenue should be fired!
I was generally pleased with TurboTax, using the product since 2008. My 2015 return was unsatisfactory. After completing the ENTIRE entry of my Fed. and State returns, the software refused to E-File the returns because of a missing dollar amount on Box 12a of two 1099R forms. I manually entered "0.00" to no avail. I WAS FORCED TO PRINT AND SNAIL MAIL THE RETURNS! This negates the greatest feature of using E-File technology and is very disappointing. I will probably prepare next year's returns in a different manner.
I was a partial year state resident in the State of Ohio. I had a full year of state income tax withheld. I am receiving a refund of over $10,000 but TurboTax would have had me pay $50 to the state of Ohio. I called them and they promised a update to correct the problem. They were supposed to follow up with a call back. They did not call back. I went online, sent a complaint via their website which promised a response. No response. I filed a dispute with my credit card company today and now have to file a state return by hand. How can you trust them with any return?
Purchased the Home & Business version and was able to do 1 return but each additional return is additional.. The wording says create as many returns as you'd like but you can only Netfile up to 20 but each of those costs $$$. No help with call in support (they don't understand the product) and the Tax Advisor chat is also terrible. Logging in the webpage said the wait would be 6 mins. This product is terrible. No service and false claims. I have been on the phone for about 3 hours with no help at all. Even the agents don't know what they are talking about.
I have been using turbo tax for years now. Never had a complain until now. Basically needed to file an extra return, and ended up paying two different types of charges for ONE extra state. They need to be more upfront about their charges, and they need to re-think their business model. $40 for just the form of an extra state just seems ridiculous, and it doesnt even include the "filing charges". Almost paid $35 extra for them to deduct the filing charges from my taxes, which also didnt make sense to me.
I purchased both Federal and State 2014 filing package. I chose the paper filing method only to find out AFTER I printed out the returns, that the New York State return explicitly states "NY STATE REQUIRES THIS RETURN TO BE FILED ONLINE." Tried unsuccessfully to go back and change the filing preferences. I spent 48 minutes, most of which was on hold only to be told by a supervisor that there was no option but to start over. Intuit did refund my money, but the time spent is invaluable.
I have used TT for over 6 years and this year was a nightmare especially with the state portion. I am a tax preparer and use TT yearly to prepare my client's taxes and some clients did not get their return on time. I have one client where I file her taxes on February 15 and she still has not gotten her refund yet. I originally bought TT Deluxe and had to purchase TT Premier which was more money, so have two programs which I only used one of them. I really would like a refund for one of my taxes bought because both of them did not work efficiently at all. I purchased two TTs but can only find one receipt. What happened this year to TT. I plan to buy H&R Block Tax software next year and hope I will get better results.
I had already done my return on H&R Block software, but because I already used my 5 efiles, I had to either mail my return or use a different program. So I knew I would have to buy the program, but wasn't sure how they were going to TRICK me into doing so. Well -- in order for them to allow me to use my "property tax" deduction, I HAD to purchase the Deluxe program! I was frustrated. I was prepared to pay - but was Not prepared to be tricked. I feel as tho others will be tricked too! Beware, for the SAME price, you can get H&R Block's program and NOT feel tricked!
Started using Turbo Tax online, and entered almost all of my info. I was waiting on some K-1s. At that time Turbo Tax said I owed Uncle Sam 592 and the state 1100. When I received the rest of my paperwork they told me I needed to upgrade of course. I went to a local tax preparer with all my info. Lo and behold I got a refund of 880 federal and owed the state 400. I will never use any online tax software EVER again. Thinking that they were actually doing my taxes correctly, the individual charged almost the same as this upgrade was going to cost. Dont use ANY of these piece of crap softwares.
Turbotax requires a customer with a Premier Version to upgrade to a Business Version in order to include a K-1 in your return. The problem with this is that the Premier Version is described as including investments. I received an investment K-1 with interest income of $5.00 and Turbotax wants $10 to upgrade. Additionally upgrading is a time wasting process whereby a computer asks for your name, phone number and email address and then hands you over to a sales rep who asks for the same. The sales rep will place you on a long hold if you complain. Their explanation for the time waster is that it is for the customer's security.
I could not get my in home office and other business expenses in Schedule C. I E-mailed TurboTax for help and was told I would have to pay an additional $79 for their customer service. This is outrageous when I had paid $99 for their software.
Repetitive frozen computer during input of information - Bought new Turbo Tax for home and rental at Costco. Updated program prior to starting. I have a fairly new HP computer. The program froze more times to count. 2/3rds through it froze completely, went into recovery and repair mode then died.
I am adding my highly negative comments about my TurboTax experience. I have been an online customer for several years but am done! At least four hours of my time today has been wasted. This includes preparing a return for my deceased father’s taxes, being unable to correct a 1310 error and resubmit it [I am informed I now must mail the return], repeatedly and unsuccessfully trying to access information for my own tax return using various approaches [loops back to my father's tax return] and time spent on the phone with customer support representatives ** [called disconnected] and ** , who after several extended holds finally told me a download also is not possible. I was directed to try search engines other than Safari. I was told my computer [the same Macbook I've used the last 4 years] is the problem. I was also informed that TurboTax does not work with Mac this year and that the issue will not be fixed until approximately April 28th. The fact that this company’s program does not support the use of Mac computers this year and TurboTax cannot have the issue resolved until nearly two weeks after the tax filing deadline is ludicrous in the extreme. Although I have been a customer for several years, I am forced to take my business elsewhere because I have a Mac, which is suddenly not usable with TurboTax. What incompetents are employed by TurboTax to allow this to occur????
Turbo Tax Deluxe software problem: I have used TurboTax for approximately 15 years. Never had to call or had a problem until this year. When TurboTax says "support" don't believe it. My wife did not get her full Required Minimum Distribution from her IRAs and 401K though some errors we made. TurboTax walked me through the form 5329, the program correctly put in the amount of RMD undistributed and provided a place to enter and explanation of why the entire distribution was not taken and what was done to correct the problem. This I entered into the TurboTax form. Everything looked fine, tax was completed and final check said 100% error-free. I printed the tax forms as though planning to mail (I always do this prior to e-filing). The explanation of why and corrections for the short distribution were not there. The program showed $0.00 tax penalty as though TurboTax made the decision for the IRS to accept my explanation. Filing the return without an explanation will surely result in a 50% penalty. I needed to find out why the program did not print this information and determined there would be not penalty. Searched ** for anyone else having this problem. None found. Enrolled as a member so that I might ask as question about the problem. This question I submitted does not go to TurboTax but is sent to a "Community Question and Answer" forum to be answered by other members/users. I knew this was software problem and needed to be answered by a technical person familiar with the programming. Called customer service (800) 358-6057. Spoke with someone but did not get her name. Explained the problem. She states she has to transfer me to "Tax support." I was on hold for an hour. Had to give up after that amount of time. Called back customer service: Spoke with ** (explained the problem) who could not find any answer to the question. Kept researching community questions, which I had already done quite extensively. She asked a lot of questions about the problem and tax program. She did a lot of research in TurboTax questions and answers but found nothing. She transferred me to "Tax Support" again. Held on hold for about 45 minutes and my phone died for lack of battery power. Called back again: Spoke with ** who looked at notes in their system as I requested. I asked for a supervisor but that requested was ignored. I asked him to transfer me to Technical Support without trying to do any research as the prior two had. He transferred me to "Tax Support" again. I was on hold for about 45 minutes, then spoke with **. ** states, "Could be a glitch." I told him, "I update the program every time I open up TurboTax and in fact had done so this morning." He did some research and could not find an answer but states that it looks like I may need the "Personal and Business" tax program and the form 5329 is not supported by the "Basic" or "Deluxe" program. I stated that did not sound right. Why would a business program deal with RMDs which is strictly a personal problem for seniors? He states it says in what he researched that these forms are not covered and he listed off a bunch. I jotted down these forms he mentioned: Form 5329, 1040NR, 4970, 5740, 5471, 5713, 5884 and 6479. This was not entire list by any means. I advised their package should state forms which are not covered prior to buying the software. Again I asked for a supervisor. After a wait of 20 to 25 minutes, he stated there was no supervisor available. He would have one call me when one became available. He gave me case number ** and a new phone number (800) 446-8848. Join me in getting TurboTax to define which forms are covered under which programs. They are trying to force me to buy Business when Business does not have anything to do with IRAs which are for individuals only.
I will not be using Tax Turbo next year. Tried to e file and would not let me due to bug in zip code field. There was a second bug too, so I decided to print and mail income tax. I never mailed the form, so I decided to try and log back in and retry to e file in case they fixed the bugs. I couldn't get past ready to download and print. It would not let me back to the interview or select a state income tax filing. I hate Tax turbo and NEVER again will I try them. I wish I would have called my credit card company the next day to try and get my money back.
Turbo Tax used to be a great product for a reasonable price. It seems that every year they get less transparent about their product requirements and prices. The free product that is supposed to accommodate anyone making less than $31,000 does not exist. My student children who each make less than $10,000/year were charged $60 and $95 respectively to file. The only way I could file for them on my account would have been to go out and purchase the CD? Who in the world does that anymore? Turbo Tax, you have become one of those predatory practice business that I will never use again. Goodbye after a decade of patronage.
I used the Deluxe, as I have every year for at least 20 years. I filled out all the required blocks and went to print. What I got were lovely forms with absolutely none of my information on them. So guess I'll fill out the blank forms by hand, with the info on my computer screen, and send that in. Ordered through Amazon, so will inform them of the problem too.
I stuck with TurboTax even after what they tried to pull with the deluxe/premier versions. What a mistake that was. I will never ever use TurboTax again. I got charged $54.98 in fees by some company I never heard of called Tax Products Group, apparently some partner of TurboTax. I consider this theft.
Got approved for refund. Was supposed to get 2_11_15. Have not received. Yet SBTPG claimed wrong route number so my bank returned it back on Feb 13. My fault now I moved from address filed. Faxed info to SBTPG. They refused it then I went to change on their website. I could not. They had it where I could not update new address or account sent it to wrong address. It was returned. On 21st of Feb, they then said they where returning to IRS. They took all the way to March 18 before they even sent it back. TurboTax wouldn't make bank give me my money. IRS said it was TurboTax who they gave money to and can't do nothing til they get money. IRS gave me TurboTax bank number and it's university national bank but when you call it's Santa Barbara Tax Product Group. They said IRS told them they could not send money. Back now I live in hotel paying $100 a day. I should be able to sue TurboTax and SBTPG cause agreement don't say anything about holding funds, and once fees was taken out I should have received money 7586 mine. Not the banks to hold it. Got to be a way to make someone give me my money. Both companies have bad reviews about the scam of getting interest on money instead of giving it to you. They held my money over thirty days before even returning it. Someone, Anybody, what can be done? Don't trust TurboTax or Santa Barbara Tax Product Group - doing white collar crimes. Government doing nothing like always. Go to them they send you to them. No one has answers.
First of all a few month ago my identity was stolen. Turbo Tax filed it, the IRS stopped it. Recent Turbo Tax sent me a bill. Nice huh? I think they have had a breach. Of course it was denied. I was put on hold for over 50 mins by security **, no apology, nothing. I was mad rightly so. He said calm down, and we are busy. Rude and also lied on the form about what our conversation was about.
I used Deluxe for 2013 last year. In processing 2014 taxes I was shocked to learn that Premier was required to process Schedule D this year. So I was forced to upgrade. I was using my desktop software but the upgrade process created an online version of Turbotax without my permission instead of upgrading my desktop version. Why? So I could be whacked $80 for Premier instead of the $30 upgrade from Deluxe - or the free upgrade as was promised. After all, the scumbags who designed this corrupt procedure need to upgrade both their yachts and private jets!! Crooks!!
I have used Turbotax for many years and this year it has been a real pain. I purchased the Deluxe addition as usual and had to return it and exchange it for Premier. A needless fifty mile round trip. It took many hours more than normal to complete my taxes and when finally approved with error check and sent to the IRS, it was rejected due to an error in the forms. It was a glitch in Turbotax that cost me an additional couple of hours to find and two additional rejections from the IRS before it was accepted. I still do not feel confident that my taxes are correct, just hope what Turbotax concluded is correct. To add insult to injury, TT offered me a $25 refund by email for the trouble they had caused. When I went to the form online and filled it out, it was rejected. Intuit should have taken a lesson from Coca-Cola. When you have a product that everyone likes and loves, DO NOT change it. I will no longer automatically purchase TT in the future. I will wait until late March to see how it preforms before using it again.
I will never file my taxes with them again. I filed last month received my money no problems at all. Yesterday March 26th 2015 I check my account close to $4,000 gone. All the transactions say TurboTax listing the amounts and call the phone number associated with it. TurboTax can't give me one reason or explanation why this has happened. Thanks to my bank for helping through the process of trying to get my money back, even they said it looks really weird. Thanks for nothing TurboTax.
I have never filed taxes online before. Didn't have to until I got Obama care insurance and has to file. Well you get to choose for them to take out the fee from your refund and you get the tax protection. But they ended up not taking it from my refund and taking it from my bank account and overdrew my bank account. Plus, I still haven't for my refund. It's been almost 2 months and the IRA won't give me any answers. So if you spend the 39.99 on where TurboTax is suppose to help, you're wasting your money because they won't and all they can say when you call about it is "sorry". My fiance uses TaxACT and has for years and he has never had this problem. People watch about giving them your bank information because they try to take the money out of your account even if you don't have it in your account. Then boom - a nice overdraft fee which is just as much as the fee for the taxes. All I can say, they are crooks and I will never use them again, and will let everyone know what they are.
I COULD NOT BELIEVE THIS WAS REALLY TurboTax that I called. I kept asking the representative if she was sure that I called TurboTax. An Unprepared, completely uninformed representative who had difficulty receiving letters and numbers (English was not her first language) and seemed very uninterested. I constantly had to make sure she was on the line. I (with no experience) had to make suggestions for her to finally find (OF ALL THINGS) MY ACCOUNT. When I asked for a manager after being on the phone with her for about 40 minutes, she refused (she wanted to do it) so OF COURSE when I asked her for her name she also refused and then like 5 minutes later without informing me she abruptly transferred my call to an automated recording. Unbelievable... please Train your call reps.
There was a different name on my acct so when the third party bank sent the money, they let it hit the account and immediately took it right back out. I have been searching for my money for over a month and I finally found it. The Bank of Santa Barbara has it and now they want blood before I can have my money. They never sent me anything saying that they had it either. If they have my money they have my other info too. My number and social for God's sake. I hate TurboTax and will never use them or recommend them again. Called the attorney general and reported them too. Now they will have to forgo a full audit. Peace out!
I have used TurboTax for several years and had been happy with it until this year. I do my taxes and one of my sons. I also did this year for a son who passed away. Mine was finally accepted and e-filed today after several rejections because of the pin #. My one son was rejected three times because of the pin # or the AGI from last year. I ended up mailing for my son who passed away also. In the end we are paying $139.97 for mine and $119.97 for my son which were ez forms that I had to mail myself. I called and spoke to someone who said that the $34.99 part of the fee was for deducting the fee from the federal income tax return. Anyway I told her I am not using TurboTax again.
I have been using TurboTax to prepare my taxes for the better part of a decade and have found the product to be more-or-less very dependable over the years. However, Intuit's corporate decision to massively change the product lineup smacks of the very worst of BAIT-AND-SWITCH tactics that any reputable organization should never participate. People, like myself, have been purchasing the Deluxe version of TurboTax for years and years. Now, because of their product changes, I find I had to additionally purchase the Premium version to get the same features I used to get in the Deluxe version. In doing so, I am out a total of about $130 in total costs for purchasing the product for the tax year of 2014 because Intuit decided to change the labeling and not really tell anyone. Not only was there confusion of the product switch, but the cost of the Premium version is almost 40% greater than the Deluxe version was last year to get the EXACT same product features as last years Deluxe version. Additionally, there were the issues I had downloading the "free" Wisconsin state tax forms. That seemed to work for some users and not for others. AND the inability to eFile my Federal return which never did work on my machine but only told me "my internet connection was down". What a JOKE!!! There is a LOT of competition for customers in this tax business Intuit competes in and they have lost my business for good. Next year H&R Block. I'll see if they treat their long-time customers any better.
I've used TurboTax Deluxe for many years and made my way thru my business and farm income and expenses, just without the additional help that Home and Business claims to give. This year I purchased Deluxe as always and got to my farm income and business expenses and I came to a screeching halt. Deluxe won't do Sch C or F anymore, it says "TurboTax Deluxe doesn't support the IRS form needed to report farm income." I'm having to download the upgrade for $40, supposedly I will be eligible for a $25 rebate but I'm not holding my breath. I'll look at other software for next year.
I did not order TurboTax Deluxe.... yet was charged for it. I was doing my brother's taxes via TurboTax into his savings account by direct deposit... never arrived. My brother contacted them, was told that I changed bank account numbers to steal his money. That's a bunch of BS. They then called and said they sent his money to someplace in Santa Barbara, Calif for them to take out the TurboTax Deluxe charge, then send it to his bank account where he lives... in Texas. Called bank... said they never got it. Still haven't found his money. Doing a ton of calling around but nothing yet.
I have been waiting on the phone for product and support for over 2 hours. I will not use the TURBOTAX service anymore. I am complaining of being billed twice. So maybe your service can call me back to deal with this problem. All around terrible service by TurboTax.
I currently work for TurboTax/teletech and I must say this is one of the worst companies I have ever worked for. They treat the employees like ** and the customers as well!! Their system tools are horrible, they hardly ever work correctly and the company did not provide us with the proper training to be able to handle customers issues when they call in which is a very bad reflection on the company. They basically have us doing a job that we are not qualified for. They say that one of our jobs is tax support, but none of us our tax support experts-- hell I do not know anything about tax forms etc. And the stupid ass little gen articles they have us look at are not very helpful either!!! This is the first and the last time I will ever work for this company. I wish I knew how shady this company was beforehand, I would have never applied for this funky job!! And as for the customers if you have not filed your taxes yet I want to warn you-- please do not use TurboTax, you will be very sorry!!!
I have been using Turbo Tax for years and never had a problem before. This year for tax year 2014, I filed online in February and the IRS sent the whole refund to Turbo tax (because I opted to pay the turbo tax fees from my refund) on the 17th of March. I received an email from the IRS say that my refund would be deposited in my bank on Friday 20 March. When my money was still not in my bank on Monday the 23rd, I called my bank and they told me that I needed to check with the IRS to find out where the money had been deposited. I could not get anyone at the IRS to give me any information over the phone and had to drive 50 miles to the nearest IRS office on Tuesday. The IRS informed me that the refund had been set to Turbo Tax since I elected to pay their fees from the refund and Turbo tax had my money. The IRS gave me the name of the bank, their phone number and the account number in which my money had been placed. I contacted the bank and they verified that they did have my money. Unfortunately there was a hold on my money and in order to get it released, they gave me a list of documents (including a new bank account, I could not use the checking account that I had used when I filed) that I must fax to them in order to get the money released. The list of documents contained some items that I didn't think I could get and I didn't want to open a new checking account. So I ask if there was any other way to get my money. I was told that they could send the money back to the IRS. I ask how long would that take for me to get my money. There response was call back in 5 or 6 weeks and they would be able to tell me when I could expect to get my money.
I signed into my acct. that I have been using for the last 5 or so years. After the sign in page, it prompted me to type in my name as a "get to know you page". I'm thinking they should have all this info on file. I'm not signing up to as new customer. Worried about the security of my info I called customer service, they put me on hold for over 15 minutes. I hung up and signed up with H&R.
I used TurboTax for the last eleven years. I have always highly recommended it to anyone. Because of my tax situation, I have always had to buy the more expensive version to include S corps, rental investments, etc., so I was prepared for that this year needing only the schedules for rental investment. Premier would handle what I needed, so I paid the $80 plus. First thing I found was the original attempt to update took forever and was unsuccessful. There was also no depreciation forms and I would have to wait on those until I received an email from TT. The real and massive problem came when every time I tried to download to complete my taxes, the download would not complete and it would totally lock up the computer. Along with that, there were the strangest messages from TT that would popup during download attempts. I was almost finished with a lengthy return and am unable to complete. Tried all afternoon to contact someone and/or get answers from the help forum with absolutely no results. This year the software and service is terrible. I am now forced to spend more money and choose another service for filing with only three weeks remaining.
I have used TT for 14 years and always used an upgraded product plus did my State return. Now that I don't need anything more than basic service they will not release my past years' taxes. They are locked up in MY VAULT that I PAID FOR. TT wants me to upgrade (pay them more) to release past years. This is outrageous behavior towards a loyal customer. I had heard this was happening but didn't believe they would treat a long time customer this way. Well believe it!!! They don't realize situations change, especially for people approaching retirement, and we don't need an upgraded product right now. I will need it 2 years from now and believe me I will not use TurboTax. So their campaign to make more money is going to backfire with many of us. Their product is way overpriced. They suck you in to do your Federal return and then want another $40 bucks to do your State return. It's a simple computing process to transfer the information over from the Federal form to the State form. If you have upgraded to a higher product this should be free or at least at a very low cost. Check out other services such as TaxAct or other online services. They do just as good a job for 1/3 the cost. The consequences for TT are the loss of my business and this post. I don't do this very often but when something is wrong it needs to be told. I would add my order number to this post but I am not paying TT to do my taxes this year even though I filled out all the forms. I needed some past years' forms and didn't complete the transaction when I discovered they were being held hostage. Yes I can have my past years' forms scanned and copied but I kept them with TT thinking I could access them whenever I wanted. And yes I paid their higher costs thinking I would get better long term service but it was a mistake.
I received a letter from TurboTax saying that I owed them $29.00. I file my taxes every year with an accountant that doesn't use TurboTax. Someone stole my identity and filed with TurboTax and they are charging me. I tried to call them 3 times and was left on hold over 40 minutes and never got to explain. I believe there is something fishy because they are charging me for something I didn't use and then they don't answer the phone.
I need to amend my 2014 return. I have been locked out of my account. Whenever I tried to sign in, the only option available was to have them send a confirmation code to my son's email. By the time he was able to forward the code to me, it had expired. This happened several times. I've posted on the help site with no response. Now I'm going to have to pay a tax professional to work off my printed return and amend my return. Goodbye, TurboTax.
The Federal return was filed. Smooth as silk, no problem, but TurboTax couldn't send all the info through to the State return. And I went crazy with forms requiring the payer's ID number that kept coming back, going around in circles. I called them to report the problem, and got an "incident number". They were supposed to call me back but never did. Anyway, I tried again this morning, and they have solved the problem with their program. Filled in numbers. Finished the return. They say no errors and IT'S MAILED!!!
I have been able to use Basic program for several years, my personal circumstances have not changes. This year I immediately recognized Basic was only for the EZ form. So I upgraded to Deluxe, Deductions and Homeowners at an increased cost. When starting to prepare filing recently (3/20/2015) I was advised by the program that I needed to upgrade further at increased costs. An email from **, General Manager refers to being able to get the required help at no additional costs. I called the number provided and received the message to visit an online site. Doing so, I could not locate the upgrade offered or available. I have become flustered and angry about all this. I fear I will have to go to a outside preparer to be able to file within the time allowed. My future use of Turbo Tax programs will definitely be affected by the response I receive from this message. Please help. (my age 78, & one finger typist)
First of all I would like to say that I have been using Turbo Tax since it has first come out and have always been very satisfied with the product. This year 2014 tax season, I had to purchase the Small Business Turbo Tax when in years past I could just use the Deluxe version. (I have a very small business and think this is ridiculous). So usually I spend $59, and this year I had to spend $99. Then to top the whole thing off when I did go to e-file, the program would not let me e-file without charging me 24.99 for my state taxes. In years past it would allow 1 state e-file for free but this year it kept saying I had to pay 24.99. I backed up and just filed my federal taxes and then I searched for a phone number for customer service for Turbo Tax (no easy task). I was informed that I had to go through the program and where it says "I am having trouble paying for this" there is a place to click on and it brings you to a page where there is a phone number to reach a Turbo Tax employee and give them a serial number then they in turn give you some kind of number that you enter into this webpage and then you are no longer charged the $24.99. Quite an ordeal!! I'm sure many people just gave up and paid the $24.99. I don't know why a company that has such faithful followers would try to screw people out of money. It has left me with a bad feeling about Turbo Tax in general. So they tried to get an extra $65 out of me this year. If they keep up like this it would make more sense to hire someone to do my taxes. Seriously, is that what they want?
Predatory pricing. They suck you into filling their forms and then impose crazy charges. They also have fine print in the initial review of pricing stating that the pricing is NOT FINAL and it can change later. WTF... Such a ripoff.
I have filed online using TurboTax for the last 3 years, all was good, happy customer. This year it will not let me file online without a pin. I tried numerous times online to get a pin -- then got my old records to verify I put the correct information. It was. I then called the toll free number, entered the information and computer said put 0 as pin. Didn't work? Guess I will print and trust the mail...... next year I plan to find another option to file my taxes. I feel I wasted $100 for this software! Not pleased!
Took me a month and half to be able to get my pin number. Wasn't able to get pin number from it until I tried using my phone. Then even though I started month and half ago still got charged 94 and some change. Then here they email me the price changed due to tax, whatever. At least when I filed with Tax Act with the deluxe version was less than half the price of TurboTax.
I have used TurboTax for 14 years. This year there was a significant increase in the price to file my taxes. I completed a rough draft of my taxes through TurboTax but did not file because I wanted to edit a few things. Within a week I received an email from Intuit TurboTax stating I needed to file by March 19 or the prices would increase further if I delayed beyond that date. Since when did an online tax service take on the pushy attitude of a cheap car salesman? (Sorry to all car sales people.) Since I had already invested a couple of hours in my tax preparation I went ahead and filed on March 19 but I will definitely be using a different tax company next year. TurboTax - you've alienated this once loyal customer!! I will NEVER recommend you again.
I have used TurboTax for at least 15 years when the program came on 3.5 disks which was before internet. This year, they decided to use a holding bank and stated that they would be charging me $39.00 fee for me letting them take the money out of my refund. Since I was getting a decent sized refund, I thought that would be OK even though I wasn't thrilled. When they figured what they were charging me for national, state, and local income taxes plus audit defense, it all came to around $150.00 for me to do all the work, mind you. Well, the blessed day came and I received my refund. The only problem was that the refund search on the IRS page told me that they were depositing the full amount into my bank account. Guess what, the amount deposited was $500 less than what should have been deposited. So, I started my 6 hour journey attempting to know what happened to my money. First call was finally answered by a guy who didn't know who he was much less anything else. I finally asked him if he was drunk or on drugs because of his long pauses and slurred speech. For some unknown reason, he told me that he was in Colorado and then it all became clear that he was stoned. After, he began to become philosophical with me. I got angry and asked him to transfer me to his supervisor. After an elongated pause, he slurred out, "Please hold". After several fumbles with the phone pad, I was disconnected. I called back two more times trying to get an answer. Both times, after much of the same as the first call, I asked each one if they were stoned. Neither one would answer the question. The second guy finally hung up and the third one started blaming me and the IRS for my problem.
Used TT for 6 years with great results. This year I decided to use online version of Home and Business. After more than 10 hours of work, always saved, on the website, I logged in last night to find that all of my data was lost. I called and talked to a rep who could only tell me over and over that I must have used a different user/password or not saved my work, none of which is true. I have to start all over again and I'm extremely hesitant because they already lost all my work once. Thinking about going and buying the disk but now reading reviews, I'm concerned that this won't work either! Maybe I'll try H&R or do the forms myself.
Someone created an account and used my SSN. Turbo Tax makes it so incredibly easy to take someone's refund. I can sum it up in this quote "But ** said he was mystified when Intuit repeatedly refused to adopt some basic policies that would make it more costly and complicated for fraudsters to abuse the company's service for tax refund fraud, such as blocking the re-use of the same Social Security number across a certain number of TurboTax accounts, or preventing the same account from filing more than a small number of tax returns."
I just got done doing my taxes with TT. At the very end, just when I saw light at the end of the tunnel, I tried to E-file my taxes to no avail, it told me I had "internet connection problems." Then I spent over 45 minutes trouble shooting, only to find out that after pushing the send button multiple times in a row out of frustration, voila it works!! Finished the federal return and just had to compete the state return info to finish. But wait!! There's a 20 dollar charge to E-file the state return. How come that wasn't revealed until almost the end? Oh, and you can't send the Federal return separately to avoid the charge, unless you're willing to blank out the state return and start over **. What a pile of garbage, shame on you Intuit! Fool me once, but not again. I recommend not e-filing either return, but sending by snail mail. Less convenient, but I don't like people and products that nickel and dime you. I spent 90 bucks and two hours of my time and they do me like this?
I meticulously completed filling out the free eFiling for Federal, $27.99 for State, double checking all the data -- ensuring that I only selected $27.99 for state filing, I entered my credit card information. After clicking "continue," the receipt pops up with an additional $29.99 'plus service' charged to my account. This is thievery. The program automatically tacked on an upgrade. This is infuriating. I stopped the process immediately and generated a ticket. Called customer service and was told the refund would be put back on my card immediately and I would receive an email confirmation within one minute. 30 minutes later...no refund, no email. Contacted customer service again and was told it would be 5 days until my refund was credited to my card. There goes lunch. They stole my money over a service I declined. My attached 'review' of my charges vs the 'receipt' of charges makes it clear. I've learned following this experience that I'm not the only one this has happened to. You cannot trust Intuit. Thank you.
I have used Turbo Tax for many years, and I was very satisfied. There was online help and simple directions all the way through. This year there is no help. I could not print my forms or file them because the system is insisting on my pension income that I enter at "simplified method, line 3," the cost basis of the pension. I have received my pension since 2005, and filed every year using Turbo Tax. This is the first time this has been asked. I have no answer, and apparently neither does Turbo Tax. NEVER AGAIN. I need help with real people.
I have used TurboTax for years but was forced to upgrade online from Basic to Deluxe in order to work on a Schedule C to report my business income. I never had problem with this in prior years. Also, I am tired of paying their processing fees. This year I sent my forms in by mail and got my return electronically deposited within 6 weeks. I remember paying $14.95 for the basic version, now I have to pay $79.95. Really!
I had three services calls that were fruitless due to incorrect information. First call was to see about importing the 2013 return into the 2014 return after I had started on it. I was told only after 1-1/2 on the phone that it wasn't possible. In addition, he as a courtesy when I inquired about saving it online offered me gratis the online version to save to a "vault". I couldn't log into this vault and made a second call (first was to **) to **. I tried and she was more knowledgeable but also she told me after an hour of having me input my information that the vault was down and to retry to save docs there in a few hours. Well I waited three days until I had the time (after spending 2-1/2 hours the first time with a lot of frustration). I was also unable to get into the 'vault' even the online support answers offered by Turbo Tax. So, I made my third and final call and reached a manager who I asked for specifically since I had been through the drill twice before. This time he explained I didn't need or understand (despite reading his own internal notes) why I had an online version. To add to my frustration he explained during this initial conversation that I could save my docs online w/o filing an online version. He also found that the first tech was wrong to have me uninstall my desktop version to get the online version and that ** was also wrong. After spending an hour (mostly me explaining to him the prior scenarios) we reinstalled the desktop and again tried to get into the vault and I got the same results. He stated I had the vault and stated if that was so how come I couldn't select my documents to save to it as ** had explained I could do. He was unable to explain why and tried to tell me that I don't need to save it online - to save it to my computer rather than the cloud. I explained that I had spent hours for that specific feature whereby he tried to tell me what was good for me - save it not only on my desktop but also another place (like Google drive etc.) He also during the beginning of the call stated that as a result of the inconvenience that he was sending me a credit for next year's returns so that I wouldn't be out any money for the time and trouble and that I was a valued customer. At the end of the call (another 1-1/2) I explained my reason for calling (unable to open the vault and now being hit with two charges to file my fed/state return was unacceptable since I was given a code to enter). He was unable to resolve that. He said that the code I was given had already been used. I said, "If that was the case how come I can't get into this vault?" So, I ended the call in more frustration than when I called. In any I will not plan on ever using TurboTax in the future and instead look at alternatives since despite using this product since around 1996 I'm done with their horrible support, lack of integrity to honor their word, and working to frustrate my experience to where I will not come back.
STOP!!!! DO NOT USE TURBO TAX. I have been using it for the last 10 years and this year is the worst. When I filed, it said I could not e-file and that I had to print it. Now that is a problem because I don't own a printer. I do everything online. So now I have to go and pay to use a computer and then pay to print at a copy shop. No way, so I called. The first guy didn't know what he was doing and then put me on hold for an hour and 40 minutes. I don't know why I stayed on the line but I did. Then he transfer me to another guy. I have been on hold for 3 hours now. All I want is my money back. I'm switching to H&R Block. The worst customer service ever and they keep asking you to upgrade so no matter what, you have to pay. It is a complete lie that it's free.
I tried to pay my taxes on the website dozens of times and could not and was told that three different cards were expired. There were numerous problems with making payment.
I filed my taxes with turbo taxes and everything went good. About a week ago I get an email from turbo tax saying my refund wasn't enough to cover the filing fees so I need to pay by credit card. My heart fell like what, I'm getting almost $4000 back - this can't be right. In the e-mail it said I could have owed student loans, child support or back taxes, so I called IRS and I was told that my taxes was still being processed and I do have a debt for $124 dollars to the department of Ed. With that being said the IRS have their own electronic filling system that I will use next year. I'm cool on turbo tax for almost scaring me out of my pants.
I have used Turbotax for many years with quite satisfactory results. I doubt I will again after paying for a return I cannot print or e-file because of a Turbotax software bug (I was a software professional before retiring years ago.) I asked for help, waited to finally get a harried-sounding "expert" on the phone who apparently hung up on me after maybe 2 or 3 seconds. I say "apparently" because I suppose there could have been some problem with phone line. I was not rude nor obscene. There was no follow-up from Turbotax. This has left me in a very desperate situation. I have tried many ways of working around the bug (something I once made my living doing) but all efforts have failed to date.
We have used Turbo Tax for a number of years, but this year, we are actually unable to use the program due to a cell being hard coded with a 9,999,999.99. There was no way to override the error. The number appeared on the Deluxe version on Schedule A line 5 of The Federal Form. It showed us getting a nice refund of over $8K (sure) when we actually owe.
Have used T Tax several years. Have even used the free edition to help disabled people file their returns. This year's product is so sorry, keeps diverting you to upgrade and if you don't upgrade then you have to start all over again even though you have the log in information. Then at the file window it wants to charge you for state e-file. Would not even print out the federal form 1040 for mail filing. I have had it with TurboTax. I have bought for personal use this year's program Home and Business but will change to another program for next year.
I have cancelled future TurboTax subscriptions because of the arbitrary changes to their tax software products without informing the consumer in advance. I spent 30 mins. scouring the TT site looking for instructions on how to cancel the subscription. There are no cancellation instructions posted. I called their helpline. After being on hold for 15 to 20 minutes it took the TT representative at least 30 minutes to find out how to cancel the subscription. An argument can be made that TT purposely makes it difficult to cancel a subscription. The reasons are obvious.
I have been using the TurboTax Software for years. I usually just print my state return and avoid the filing fee. Usually no fuss. I buy the software for my Mac. Did the same this year. Turns out this year, I need to install the software on two computers. But I can't find the activation code that came with the CD. No big deal, right? My product is registered, all I have to do is call. And yeah, I know I can download the software, but I guess it's habit to buy it when it goes on sale each year. Not the point. Anyway, I call. First, I am in queue for over an hour. Then the agent I get leaves me hanging for 15 minutes between each question. Then she tells me that the software for Mac doesn't exist. The program is only available in download, not a physical CD. This, despite the fact it is for sale at Costco, Staples, Office Depot, and Amazon will even send you a disc if you want. Also, despite the fact I am holding, in my nicely manicured finger, a disc for TurboTax (2014 tax year) that works for Mac and PC. She continues to claim that this can't be true and refuses to bump me up to a supervisor, saying I can return my nonexistent software for a refund. Huh? I finally get fed up and disconnect, and assume I will now have to sit in phone queue and do some yelling until I can get a reasonable person on the line. Also, when I did my return (the second installation is for a family member) I was forced to upgrade in order to a Schedule C. I was promised a refund. I of course, am still waiting.
I am a Turbo Tax Deluxe (TTD) user for the last 15 years and I have a major complaint about Turbo Tax Premier (TTP). Usually when I do my taxes it takes me less than 4 hours using Turbo Tax Deluxe. I am prepared with all my documentation, 1099 forms, etc. This year it took me over 15 hours and I still have to do my State taxes. Why the difference? It was due to errors in Turbo Tax Deluxe and Turbo Tax Premier. My wife ** has some Oil Stock Royalties - revenue she receives every year (1099-MISC) but they don't amount to much (< $200). I have always put them into Schedule E in TTD. This year as I started TTD and input these royalties, TTD said I needed Turbo Tax Premier (TTP) - strange since I never needed TTP before this year (???). Since the upgrade was free this year I upgraded to TTP. This has caused all kinds of problems with these small Royalties and when TTP imported what I had already input into TTD (Royalties, Interests and Dividends from my 1099's), it did not import one of my largest 1099-DIV that I had already input into TTD. The other problem is since I am now using TTP, it didn't update Schedule E correctly. This is why I upgraded to TTP! TTP also wanted to do a Schedule C (Self Employed?) which I have never needed before. TTP asked all sorts of questions about my wife being the owner of these oil wells and sending out 1099-MISC, etc. What is wrong with Turbo Tax Deluxe and Premium? Why didn't TTP import the already done Dividend 1099-DIV information from TTD when I upgraded to TTP? Why did TTP think that the 1099-MISC required a Schedule C? Turbo Tax has some MAJOR problems this year and needs to straighten these out before I will ever use this product again. My taxes are simple and I can just use the IRA forms and do the math myself. Why should I use a defective Turbo Tax? The least Turbo Tax can do is fix their products - a refund of my $42 for TTD would be a goodwill gesture. I wasted 11 hours finding and correcting Turbo Tax Premier errors. I await a response from Turbo Tax on this problem!
I used Intuit-TurboTax for many years, and each year, it has become a second rate software. Just getting started is like going through a wall? They try to simplify the detail forms and I cannot access them to print? Whomever is responsible has never asked users how to make it a simple and useful tool. Its Deductible software locks up entering data, and finally after a week, I had access? Explain that? I download my financial data from ML and it double-entered the same data of myself but not my wife's. I went back to re-read ML data is was fine. Explain that? Just trying to log into TurboTax has become nightmare. I signed in with my password and did not work? I tried the third time and accepts it???? Figure that out? This happens every time so I keep trying and the password is accepted. Something simple has become difficult. Then, we get bombarded by emails. This company has its priority up its ** . I decided I will go another route next year than to waste more of my time with TurboTax. I wish consumers will pressure this company's $$$$ to make changes in management.
One moment the program would indicate that I was owing $2000.00 instead of the $750.00, and then it would suddenly change to inform me of a refund of over a million dollars. Then it deleted present past tax programs.
I paid some dumb ass ** $130 to fix my state returns that I was having difficulty with, then he just went and redid all my taxes which was not communicated to me. Now they don't even contact you back like what the ** is wrong with you!
Used TurboTax (2014). When we got our Visa statement we were charged $20 for filing our state tax return. Really????? Goodbye TurboTax....... never again. Customer service is a joke. I hung up after being left on the phone hanging for 20 mins.
I've used TurboTax for years. Tried to login this year and their system could not recognize my email/login/password. Nothing has changed (on my side) but Turbo did not recognize my email, my user ID, password. Nothing. None of the "help" pages worked either. After about 10 hours of phone calls, on which the call was usually dropped when someone tried to transfer me to another person, I finally got access. This was MUCH much TOO difficult. And the issue was YOUR system screwed up. Two weeks later.... this all happened AGAIN. Today's dropped calls numbered 8. Finally waited up until midnight (way past my bedtime) to call and was able to get help. I really don't enjoy spending 10-15 hours trying to get a hold of a company to fix their issues with my data. This does NOT give me confidence in the security, software, or the owners. I will finish this year since I've already paid and I'm halfway through entering data.... but I WILL NEVER USE TURBO AGAIN.
Used online 'free' version. Not happy at all. Said free as you get into it. Cost more to complete and file. Also emailed approved, and refund in 2 to 6 weeks. Then 2 weeks later, denied and had to call IRS. Now have to file forms via mail. Better off just printing from IRS site and doing on my own. Nothing gained. But lost money paying for online filing.
I bought from Costco TT Deluxe and a couple of weeks later got a postcard with Costco in Washington on the front as the sender. It stated that when I started TT it would automatically upgrade me to Premier at no cost. This did not happen. I took it back to Costco for a refund. Got it. Then purchased Premier (am I stupid or what?). I installed it, and the program stated that the sales tax portion was not done yet, mid-March. When will it be done? Then it did not completely install, and I tried both uninstalling and re-installing it 4 times. Dumb again on my part. I then tried it on another computer and again got errors trying to install it. I could not find any way to get a hold of Intuit. I have used Turbo Tax for 16 years and will never use it again.
TurboTax: Final Notice - Account Debit Pending??? Email said I owe 74.99 and I never had to pay TurboTax.... going on 6 years and now I gotta pay 74 after I did my tax in Jan and it's now March 10th. Guess they won't send my taxes till they get that 74.99. Don't like TurboTax no more over it!!!
Initially, I filed my taxes at the end of January; rejected 3 times. Refiled 4 times...finally after the 4th rejection, I called. The rep I spoke with was nice, but didn't look into the error message I was receiving and told me it was an internal error and on 1/29 I would receive an email from Turbo Tax that it was okay to refile because they were fixing the issue and it would be complete by then. WELL, that was not the case and because the person I spoke with did not research my error thoroughly, on 1/29 when I went to refile (without an email from Turbo Tax notifying me it was okay to do this again). I looked at my return a little more in depth and was able to see they imported incorrect information, from 2013 tax filing... I resubmitted entirely deleting all the saved W-2 information, to finally get the filing "accepted". Now the IRS is advising me more information is needed to complete my return & now Turbo Tax has the audacity to tell me that when I filed I chose to deduct their "free" fees from my refund & they will now automatically deduct these from my bank account. HOW ABOUT being an advocate of positive customer experience and reaching out to me (all my info is in my account) to see if I missed something when I filed or if there is something we can do to fix the situation. Since they have nonexistent service, guess I'm on my own to determine what needs to be fixed so I can move on. NEVER HAD SUCH A STRESSFUL FILING EXPERIENCE
Someone using Turbo tax used my SSN in January and filed a return. I filed suspicious activity report with them, went to the police dept, filed a report, came home and called them back to see about getting my money back. I am now unable to file returns, again because someone using turbo tax used my SSN. The "customer service" person could not find my report #. I asked a simple question early on in the call about getting my money back and 40 minutes later, yes I am still on the phone. As we speak, she finally tells me, they don't do refunds... So, WHY DIDN'T SHE TELL ME THAT IN THE FIRST 5 MINUTES OF THE CONVERSATION??? Now waiting for a supervisor, on hold for way too long... This was the 6th year I used this service and it will be my last and anyone who listens will hear about my bad experience with them
I've used TurboTax since it first was released and eFiled since it was available. This year is the last for TurboTax. I got 3 different 1098 Mortgage Interest forms last year because of a refinance and Home Improvement Loan. I let TT download them from my bank. When it was time to eFile, TT told me there was a problem with my 1098's yet it wouldn't tell me what it was and when reviewing them, they were complete. Customer service, when I finally got through, told me they didn't know what was wrong either but it was probably because I had 3 forms from the same financial institution. I was told there was no way to override the error and I'd have to file by mail. Thanks for the long wait for my refund, TurboTax!
I start doing my taxes with a free version and I end up on a deluxe without having any knowledge that I was in a deluxe option. No one ever ask me if I want to switch . But when I was trying to find a phone number, I found one that end up being no longer a valid number. Then I found that if I want go back to a free version I have to delete everything I already did. What kind of service it is??? I am really disappointed!!!
Not only does TurboTax charge for their "free" Software, they just might not send all of the forms that they the IRS needs delaying any refund you might have been depending on for 6 to 8 more weeks. Beware and make sure that TurboTax forwards "all" of the forms you fill out to the IRS.
Really unbelievable. I purchased TurboTax basic as I have done for the last 7 years. I should have purchased the deluxe version as I now have a small piece of farm ground that I rent to a farmer. No other deductions related to the rental ground. Since I now have a 1099-misc. to file the program will not handle it. OK, I understand, so I have to upgrade to the deluxe version and I do. I go two pages and I am told I have to upgrade to the premier version. So my total cost was $15.89 for basic, $42.40 for the deluxe download, $31.80 for the premier download, for a total cost of $90.89. Now If the Deluxe version would have handled my simple 1099-misc. form why was I told to upgrade to the premier version? I would expect a rebate on the $31.80 since I apparently didn't need that upgrade. So I figure I will at least recoup $25.00 according to your rebate. When I go to your web site to file for it, I am told since I didn't use the deluxe version last year I did not qualify for the rebate. I didn't need the deluxe version last year, I did not own the farm ground then, I inherited it last year. So after 7 years of a great tax program, that I recommended to family and a lot of friends it has come to this. You have lost a loyal customer. There are too many other tax programs out there to be used. Why would I stay with TurboTax? The answer is I wouldn't. Thank you for the great tax program you had in the past. Sorry to see your business model take such a downturn. Perhaps you can recover, although I doubt it. Once you start losing market share, this kind of customer nightmare only increases the slippery slope down.
Simple return. No taxes payable, but employer accidentally withheld. Needed to get refund. Insisted on charging for state return when only want to file free federal return. Customer service was also difficult. Couldn't reach anybody. Ended up using other services and MD state iFile for free. Wanted to remove the data from TurboTax, but couldn't...and no support available. Horrible, horrible experience.
Messed over on the promised $25 rebate. Thought I had been scammed. Reported fraud to the FBI. Went to the turbotax support page - this time I really was scammed - let them take remote control of my computer. They underlined turbotax email (Our apologies. We're fixing things) and informed me it was false, showed me a list of IP addresses and informed me that my network was compromised. Took me 2 days and $40 additional to allay my fears (changed my network password and purchased new security software). If you remember a couple of years ago they changed their electronic submission policy. Makes you wonder why the IRS lets them cheat us. In Intuit's defense after 3 upgrades (Premium, Home and Business and a 2nd State) their software finally worked. Oh yeah, one more thing, buying an extra state cost me about the same as purchasing the "Deluxe" package which includes on free state not to mention the $31.80 I spent upgrading.
Been using TurboTax and Intuit for years always successfully. The 2014 program does not want to work no matter what. I split investment income with my spouse and indicate the percentages. It does calculate. So we have 100% of the income. I am splitting pension and filled out every box needed. It will not transpose the numbers to her return. And you cannot contact anyone. In the past you could email. Will never use TurboTax again or recommend it.
Turbo Tax 2015 gives a lot of headache this morning. First, I experience many time frozen on the screen during filing. I am so concern that I need to re-enter the data again. The worse experience is that I cannot use the EFiling. I have use Tax software for so many year. I always can file my Tax return through EFiling. This is my first time that I cannot do it this year. DON'T BUY THIS SOFTWARE.
Used the FREE software and ended up having 29.99 deducted from my return. Additionally, another 20.00 went missing and was not listed on the pay stub. I called Customer Service and went through the biggest rash of RUDE, IGNORANT AND JUST PLAIN STUPID customer service people I have ever encountered. They actually raised their voices to me! No one would answer the simple question as to the whereabouts of twenty bucks. First they said I should call my bank. My bank knew nothing and had no records of having refused a deposit due to incorrect routing information. They have NO RECORD. Called back to TT. Now the rep says it was their OWN bank that took the twenty dollars because of bad routing information. Okay, so why did they not list that 20 dollars as a deduction on my check stub? No one seems to have an answer. So, now my humble return which should have cost me NOTHING has cost me FIFTY BUCKS! They put you on hold for long periods of time, making you wonder if you may have been disconnected and then when you do speak to someone, they have no idea how to answer your question. SAVE YOURSELF THE AGGRAVATION! GO TO H & R BLOCK AND BE DONE WITH IT. THESE PEOPLE ARE CROOKS...AND NOT EVEN SMART ONES.
I used the TurboTax online system in 2010 to do my taxes, having a good experience the previous year, but Intuit had changed something in their system in handling 1099 forms and the refund they said was confirmed was nearly $5000 too much. As it takes the IRS a few years to find out these things I wound up with a $13,000 tax bill all thanks to TurboTax. From now on I am using the IRS system, regardless of the advertising or reviews. At least with them I know what I get.
I have had the opportunity of doing my taxes with turbo for the past 6 or 7 years. This year was the worst and I will never use them again! You have to spend half of your day on hold trying to speak with a customer service representative. If you are married filing separately for the first time, you will have issues! I promise you, you don't want to do this! I will never file with them again!!! They are horrible and have difficulty themselves. I had to call the IRS to get to the bottom line of everything. I want to just get a refund fee I paid turbo to file elsewhere. I'm so over the headache!!
The whole experience was awful!! I use to love turbo tax, I don't know what is going on with them. First it would not let me import my turbo tax info from 2013, therefore I needed to start from scratch. I found myself manually going over my printed tax returns from 2012 and 2013 since the 2014 program would not take any of my old information, it was frustrating and extremely time consuming. Had I known I would of just completed the traditional forms. I had no idea how limited the deluxe version was until I tried to put in additional info. Apparently the deluxe version was downgraded from 2013 and required additional money. I decided to scrap the whole process and get an accountant. When I tried to print my what I completed, turbo tax requested more money!! I wasted money and a whole lot of time!
I've used Turbo Tax for 15 years and have always been satisfied with my results. I've always used the Deluxe version except for last year 2013. Since we have a small farming business I decided to try the Home and Business version to see if it would give me any additional business deduction options. The only difference I saw was it gave me the ability to print 1099s or W2s. So this year I went back to the Deluxe version and boy was I in for a surprise; no longer did it offer Schedule C or F and I HAVE to upgrade to Home and Business. Turbo Tax offers a $25 rebate but since I did NOT use Deluxe in 2013 I don't qualify. How is that fair? What about the numerous prior years of using Deluxe doesn't that count for something? Apparently NOT.
I have filed my taxes with TurboTax for the past 5 years. This year is the first year that I have encountered any issues, but it is a huge issue. I still haven't received my refund and it's been over a month. TurboTax told me personally that it was not their error. However my fiance filed with TurboTax as well but on a later date, February 10th. Her return was given to her in about 10 days. I called the IRS for answers and they specifically told me that people who filed early with TurboTax are showing signs of fraud and or errors. So the majority of everyone who filed early might get their income tax as late as April! I understand every business can make mistakes, but TurboTax has offered me no solutions or help. They even deny that the issue is on their end. I feel like nobody wants to help the people in my situation, and I really need that money to continue paying bills on time.
I filed my tax return for my first time with these guys as 2014 was my first year at the United States, so, everything was fine and I chose the option of "Pay the services with your refund" so far so good; nevertheless, the IRS delayed my tax return for more than 21 days as is a first year filing and my status of non-citizen, so Turbo Tax just decided to send me an email saying my refund was insufficient to cover the services and they are requiring the payment. First of all, this is a lie because the refund is just delayed, not decreased; and second of all they should have told me about this decision when filing. For example "Turbotax would require the payment of the services if IRS delays your refund for more than 21 days." I'm really angry about this, also I called their customer services and basically they were so harsh to me giving no explanation nor solution.
TurboTax sent many emails advertising "free federal tax filing" service. Now they are telling me that since I chose to have audit defense service fee deducted from my refund instead of paying for it right away, that I am being charged an additional $34.99. If I had seen that fee when I chose to have audit defense fee deducted from my return I would not have agreed. The agent I was on the phone with, **, also told me that the fee information I am describing is not displayed plainly and not displayed in bold type for easy recognition. When I asked her to remove the fee she said she was not able to comply. She asked me several times what could she do to end the call positively? I responded each time by telling her to remove the fee and she continued to reject that as a solution. I requested to talk to a supervisor. She asked me if she could put me on hold? I agreed. After a lengthy hold, she came back on the line and said there were no supervisors available. I said that was unbelievable. That there are always supervisors available. She then said there were supervisors but they were all busy. She asked to put me on hold again while she attempted to get a supervisor. I agreed. Again she came back after a long time and told me still no one available. So I told her I would not be a returning customer.
I have filed with turbotax for several years now and this is the first year I will be going back to the old way. First it said it would be 19.99 to 'upgrade', but when I got to the end it was 29.99. Plus state 27.99 then when you choose the automatic bank deposit, in the fine print mind you, it was another 29.99 for bank fees. I only need the 1040 for myself and my spouse with 1 dependent. So my original refund was over 3000. I was not about to pay 90 to file a 1040 when it is normally the cost of a stamp if you do it by hand. So I canceled the whole thing and started over. When I got to the deductions part, it would not let me get my EIC or my child tax credit anymore after I had just gone though their "upgraded' version and it gave it to me there. This software is **!!! Also, it said I made nearly 10000 more than I really did. Not sure how that happened. Go elsewhere. You are already doing your own. It's not that much harder to get a piece of paper for the post office or library and send it in. Cheaper and less hassle and at least you know you did it right.
My husband and I filed our taxes married but separately this year. We paid all fees upfront to avoid money being taken from our refund. When we submitted our taxes to be filed and it was accepted from the IRS, Turbo Tax stated the amount of money we would be getting back. Once the money was automatically deposited into our account, my husband's federal was $700 LESS than what it should have been. His state refund was the exact amount TT said it would be. Neither my federal nor my state has come in yet. Why would his federal refund be less? Has this happened to anyone else?
Used this service before but this time was horrible! My taxable social security seemed high so I did the worksheet 3X on my own and they miscalculated my taxable social security by $2000! Then they added my dividends to my capital gains total as well as listing the capital gains separately. So it added quite a bit to my income which was wrong. I deleted everything and carefully did again and not only is it still wrong but the social security amount is different even though the same amounts were input! Called and after over 1 hour on hold and talking to people that are not trained and being transferred I'm going somewhere else. Think I'll just go back to H&R Block. Everyone should check their returns carefully or they will be filing returns with mistakes.
I filed for my 2014 tax return on 01/22/2015 with TurboTax. It was accepted on 01/23/2015. I opted for TurboTax to take my fees out of TurboTax. I received a response from "Where is my refund" on IRS website that my refund of $$$$$ was approved and to be direct deposited on Feb 4, 2015. On Feb 4th, 2015 Nothing was deposited into my checking account. I called IRS after a few days, they told me I had to wait 21 days before they could look into anything. I waited the 21 days, still no deposit into my checking account. Today after a few days of just getting recording on the IRS phone line, I got through to a live person at the IRS. They says IRS sent my money to a TurboTax company with University National Bank at 877-908-7728, also sbtpg.com (Santa Barbara Tax Products Group LLC). I called them, they said someone hacked into the TurboTax and changed my checking account routing number and account number on Feb 2, 2015, 2 days before my direct deposit was supposed to be deposited into my correct checking account. This should have been a big red flag with Santa Barbara Tax Products Group LLC - they should have notified me. IRS website says that if there is any problem with direct deposit, they will mail you a paper check. There should have been no way that someone can change my direct deposit information and be able to hack into TurboTax. I was told to file a police report, contact IRS, and file a report with the FTC. Santa Barbara Tax Products Group LLC says they will do an investigation, IRS will investigate. No idea how long this could take, possible 6 months or longer. This is a total nightmare. TurboTax and Santa Barbara Tax Products Group LLC were totally hacked and now I have no idea if I will ever get my tax return this year.
This is my first time using online tax services. I have never experienced something so unsatisfactory. DO NOT USE THEM! I got an email claiming the IRS rejected my taxes so I went to the website and did everything over again step by step that they stated would fix the issue....THREE TIMES NOW. I have called every customer service number listed for them. I contacted the support staff over and over again - no email no phone call....nothing. So now my personal information as well as my child's is just floating around the internet. They are the most unprofessional business I have ever seen in my life. The number the customer service gave me was a automated voice that hung up on me several times. If you enjoy being extremely frustrated and having your blood pressure raised to the maximum by all means use this degenerate company.
It is advertised as free and it's not. My taxes are as simple as they get and I have spent over an hour answering questions and I'm still unable to file. I will never use this site again.
I used an accountant for my 2013 and 2014 taxes. Prior to this, I used TurboTax. On 2/27/15, my accountant tried to file my 2014 taxes and received a notice that the filing was rejected because my taxes had already been filed. I went into my old TurboTax account and found the filed fraudulent tax form there. I immediately called TurboTax. TT took no responsibility -- said TT was just a "middleman" in the tax filing process and someone stole my social security number. The thief guessed my income and the amount of taxes I had paid. TT couldn't tell me how the thief was able to use a new email along with my name and SSN. Also, in years past, I always had to enter my previous year's AGI before I could e-file. TT is lax on their security and I will not use them again. I will now have to go through the trouble of filing my tax form by mail, a police report, filing an affidavit, calling the IRS, calling Social Security, placing credit freezes, and waiting 6-8 months for my refund.
They say it's FREE, but you have to pay $30 to get your state refund and complete your federal. Then, you can't just have a refund check mailed. If you don't have a bank account your only option is a NetSpend Visa Card with a $5 monthly charge plus exorbitant fees each time the card is used. They in effect hold your money for ransom.
If Turbotax simply asked what tax forms you have in the beginning, and let you know what service you're required to purchase based on those forms, I'd be giving them five stars. Unfortunately, I spent about 45 minutes putting in personal information and W2 information, only to discover that I was required to purchase something. Having a 1099-OID form requires me to purchase a $35 Deluxe Service. I didn't think that was too bad, and I'd already invested the time, so I agreed and continued. Once I got to filling out form 1099-B, they informed me that I would have to purchase the $55 Premier Service. By this time I was frustrated, gave up and decided to take it to H&R block, which ended up being cheaper. Again, the service would be much more honest if they would just let you know how much you're required to pay from the get-go. I'm sure it's nice if you have very simple tax information, such as W-2's only, but anything more requires you to spend money; and you're only notified about this after you've completed 75% of the other forms.
I purchased the TurboTax Premier software for 2014 under the only terms permitted on the website - that I agree to have them charge my credit card in all future years and send me a link for the next year. But I for sure do not want this - but having read the fine print, I am promised online that I can go back and amend my agreement with them to specify that I do not want the software automatically in future years. But I challenge any one to find a way on their website to change the agreement to have them stop this - it's not possible. It's a false promise in the fine print that this can be done when it can't.
This site guaranteed to accurately file my taxes. I never filed for a child care credit, THEY FILED IT FOR ME. I had to get a call from the State telling me I filed for money I did not qualify for, so now I am flagged for an AUDIT. I spent 2 hours on the phone with a rep who then said someone will call me within 48 hours. It is now 2 weeks. No one called. I tried calling back. The rep had no idea what I was talking about and said "no they will email you" then says "I know for a fact turbo tax will never send reparations for filing wrong on your behalf"!!!!!! No call, no email. I received a confirmation email about the call and them refunding me money... nothing. Now it's 28 days for my federal return and for no reason a check was issued when I always get direct deposit. The state direct deposited the federal despite them charging me for a direct deposit they had it mailed. Do not use these people. I don't know how they are allowed to run their CLEARLY FRAUDULENT BUSINESS. Filing money on people's behalf without them knowing it.
Filed online with Turbo thieves before, many stupid years on me I guess, but not since I realize once you get audited...!! Well they're long gone, took your money that you paid to get protected, "promises" only to get your almighty dollar, try calling for help...You will see that they're not even up and running till around next tax time for following year. By the time you get your letter from IRS, they shut down service, and are probably getting unemployment checks themselves...no matter. I did the leg work, figured out on my own that all that protection $$$ you give them or gave them...save you money. Do your taxes. Enough you learn how and what website to use & fear nothing if you get audited. You can figure it out self-explanatory there letter from IRS. Now I do them for 12.00 bucks, compared to paying 150.00 or more to the thieves. I see them as the phone call scammers telling you, "You won lottery but send this amount to free it up." Never again and do not recommend for anyone & yes I itemize...go long forms...own property, sch tx, so on so forth. Married...file jointly. 12 bucks. Find your site & good luck.
When contacting TurboTax about the fact that in some cases you have to provide an explanation. As there is no way to do this, I was reassessed by the CRA (almost a year later) and had to pay the tax plus interest. When contacting TurboTax help, they say that "that is ok just do it and pay the tax when you are reassessed." This involves two more letters to the CRA. One to pay the tax and one to file a T1 adjustment. This is very clumsy way to do your taxes online.
I purchase a copy of TurboTax Deluxe to later find out the schedules I have been using for years are now pulled out, added to the Premier version for more money. The address on the website is undeliverable for returns. I am done with TurboTax.
I have been using TurboTax for a few years and have never had a problem. This tax year, 2014, I entered all my information and my Federal tax went through (I owed money). Unfortunately, it would not give me a choice to e-file my NYS taxes (I was due a refund). I was charged not only for the Federal but also for the State at around $80.00. I called TurboTax in references to it preventing me from e-filing and they claimed that NYS was the problem. I called NYS and they claimed it is a software glitch from TurboTax. Today I called back TurboTax and they still do not know what the problem is and as of now have sent it to a higher security level! What a headache!!! Won't use Turbo Tax again!!!
Like many, I received an email that state filing was free this year. I have been using TurboTax for several years, so I know about their "deluxe" filing fee, and knew I'd have to pay for it. This fee does nothing besides import your last year's data into this year's return and maybe give you access to some of the more complicated forms. When you select deluxe filing, it does not tell you that you will also now have to pay the full state filing price. It's absolutely ridiculous. Their customer service just keeps saying that it does say you have to among all the angry comments...in another window. It's extremely misleading, and you don't find out you are paying until you're done with the entire return. Add onto this yearly scam artist nonsense the fact that they messed up the transmission of state returns this year, I think I will pass on using them again.
I have been using TurboTax for the past 10 years, I have no major issues. This year is all different story. I filed my tax, and select the direct deposit options, which I have done in the past, using the same Bank, and account number. After two weeks, I check with IRS portal, (Where's my refund) according to them the money was deposited, but never shown in my account. I went to the local IRS office, they said check with my software company, and the bank. I spoke with my Bank representative, they said they never received any deposit from IRS. Now it's all confusing. I hear similar story from friends and family. What's going on?
I have used this program for years, but if this had been my first experience, I'd never do it again. The customer service experience couldn't be worse. I waited forever for a call-back - over 1 week. No one seems to know how to solve the problem. After being on hold to get a confirmation number to file my state tax, I was given a number incorrectly (i.e., without the requisite dashes). The part-time staff is not well trained; they put you on hold frequently. I have never written a review - so I hope you understand that my frustration with this company/product couldn't be worse.
Finished filing in my return but Turbo kept requesting additional information on my "annuity". I never said I had an annuity. I was on hold for over three hours talking with three different agents. The third agent hung up without answering any questions. I called back and after being placed on hold again, the system hung up on me. Never again will I try to use TurboTax. Customer service is terrible and their program is obviously flawed this year. I never had problems in past years.
The computer screen gave me an incident number when I entered the questions I had for the agent. I used their 800 number and called. The system said I should enter my phone number and they would call me within 5 minutes. I waited and waited and nothing. Two days later I decided to call again. Interesting, the system had my incident number and with 10 minutes I got to speak with a real live person. Nice woman but she couldn't answer some of my questions. If they don't know, who does? Have used TurboTax forever with great results. I don't know if I want to try the competitor so I am stuck right now. Even thinking of doing it by hand and save myself a bit of money although it will take some time. Could I get feedback from anyone who has actually used TurboTax and file it successfully without too much drama. Thanks in advance to all who will respond to me.
After completing my taxes, I selected to have the $34.99 taken out of my return, but I was charged $69.98. When I called to find out why, they said it was a processing fee because I had their fee come out of my refund. Nowhere was it stated that I would be charged if I selected that option. I would not advise TurboTax to be used to do one's taxes - they have hidden fees.
For 7 years I used TurboTax to do my taxes. No problems. This year I was charged 34.99 for the Deluxe Edition, (what I requested) and another 34.99 for them to process my return into my bank. Regardless of what I said, proved or asked there was always an excuse. This additional amount was not disclosed and if it was it wasn't where a normal person would see it. In my opinion I was robbed for the additional amount. Never again.
Taxes are a pain in and of themselves. TurboTax is supposed to fix that. In the end, they give you the option of paying via credit card or from your federal refund. No charge is shown for either and it takes another 8 pages or so to get to the final filing page and after all of that, they show a $40 charge to take their fee from the federal return. I just filed because I am overworked already and don't have the patience to re-enter data from the previous pages. Do not do business with this company. Their fees are BS on their own but a fee on selecting a guaranteed payment from a third party is ridiculous. I hope this company goes under quickly.
As a twenty+ year user of the TurboTax product (personal-premium and corporate) it is time to go our separate ways. Many good businesses are driven to their knees by individuals who think they know how consumers think and will react to any potential price increase. This year's fiasco (which included charging for downloads, and then an additional charges to e-file that download ($70.00)) is an honor bestowed upon me by Intuit, to which I am not worthy. I will keep my money and find a different product. Relationships lasting almost two decades are shredded by thoughtless, money grubbing and customer alienating attitudes and practices. In today's social media driven world, bad news spreads fast, and assuming you are smarter than the consumer, even faster if there is a perceived rip-off. I wish you Intuit all the best as you seek to replace the incompetent people who put you in this position.
I have filed with TurboTax every year for the last 6 years and always was charged around $19-$30 to file my taxes with the state of Utah, and the federal version was really free. This is acceptable. For 2014 I had an additional form because I started school, and this is the only change I made in my filing. I made a conscious effort to choose "Do Not Upgrade to Plus" on each screen where I had the option, and near the end of the process I was notified that I would be charged $27.99 to file for Utah. Again, that was normal for me and I was not concerned. I chose to pay with my debit card instead of my returns, and after I'd entered in my payment information I was informed that I had been charged over $62! Wtf?! So, I check the receipt and I see that even though I EXPLICITLY chose not to upgrade, they charged me for the upgrade anyway in addition to the state filing fee. After researching their knowledge base, I find that I was charged the additional $29.99 because I had "more than the 1040A or 1040EZ forms" in my return. ** YOU GUYS! I'll file through the mail where I know exactly what I'm paying for.
I have been able to do our taxes for years with the premier edition. This year there are suddenly new limits so that I can't complete the small amount of schedule C income that we have. The program is now carefully set up to try to force you to upgrade. Pure corporate greed. No wonder TurboTax has been getting hammered everywhere for their changes. Luckily, I am more than willing to look at TaxACT or other tax software for next year. For the most expensive tax software around this is inexcusable.
IRS is holding my refund! I was told my bank numbers was transferred wrong to them. In all my years of filing I never had a refund held. I am very, very upset.
I had almost finished my 2014 taxes when my TurboTax account suddenly stopped working. In fact, the system suddenly said my account didn't exist. I have been using TurboTax for close to a decade and suddenly my account is gone. I called the week it happened and was told that they could see my account, but couldn't access it and that someone would call me back; they never did. I called a week later and was told not only that they could see the problem but that my account wasn't going to be able to be fixed and that there was nothing they could do. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told that they were all in an emergency meeting and the men on the phone didn't know how long it would be, only that they were turning everyone away. I asked when I could call back to speak to a supervisor but he didn't know. I asked that a supervisor call me back and was told that they are not doing call outs, only accepting incoming calls. His only advice to me, which I'm taking, is that I should call the IRS right away. There was no one I could speak to. There was no solution he could offer. Information online only says that there may have been a data theft and that the IRS is reporting an increased number of fraudulent returns this year. I will be calling the IRS this afternoon. I will also continue to call TurboTax in an effort to get some answers from a supervisor; they can't be in a meeting forever. If my information has been compromised it is their responsibility to report it to me and to recommend actions to address the issue. From the way the man on the phone was speaking, it seems like they know there is a problem but the customer service agents aren't allowed to bring it up or speak about it to the customers, which is a serious problem. Regardless of the outcome of this, because of the abysmal customer service I have experienced, I will never use TurboTax again.
I filed my tax refund and I got a confirmation on my tax refund, it would be direct deposited on 2-4-15 and it was not. I waited until the 2-9-15 as it stated on where’s my tax refund website before I contacted Turbotax and the rep told me I had to talk to the tax preparer who filed my tax refund and I would receive an email regarding my claim. I never got the emails from the tax preparer. I then called the IRS and the rep put a tracer on the check and found out a University National Bank had my refund check. He gave me all the information to contacts the bank and I call and spoke with a representative named Roberta. She told me my check was there sitting on a desks and she informed me my bank rejected the check because error on account. I asked for her to correct the issue and she stated she could not take that information because it was a one-time shot and she would need to get a signed release from a supervisor to send my refund check by mail and it would be a week before I would get it in the mail. She went over my personal information and address with me to be sure it was all correct and is a good address. I confirmed everything with her and she stated they would be sending it by paper check in mail and it would take a week. Two weeks went by and I did not receive my refund in the mail. I called a Turbotax again 2-23-15 and the representative did not have my info on the status of my refund. She then contacted the office I spoke with and stated Roberta was the representative that told me I was getting my check by mail but there had been a policy change sometime after I called and now the policy stated I had to log back in to my account and make the account changes. Again I logged into to my account and went through the security questions. They were old addresses from 30 years ago that I did not remember that long ago plus people from years ago, the people I remembered. However an error came out of it and it locked me out and Turbotax charged me again for failure error. So far TurboTax has charged 34.00 for filing fees, 34.00 bank processing fees, 20.00 bank rejection fee and now online account error fee 20.00 W.T.H and now the site will not let me in to change the error and so now my check is supposed to go back to this bank that is holding it and is going to be returned to the IRS and reprocessed. I still have no idea when I will get my check. This is so wrong and I feel victimized with all the attached fees. I work hard all year long and pay my taxes biweekly. This has been the worst business practice I have ever witnessed. Also to mention that they had information about me from many years ago which is very concerning because I never gave this company any security info in the past. I feel it’s very invasive for not getting the services I paid for. What I got was scammed out of 118.00 for a 1040 EZ form that I would have fully received had I mailed in by paper form. I do not recommend TurboTax to Anyone! Beware of Turbotax misleading advertising and extra fees. Never again will I use TurboTax!
Like I have for many years, I purchased TurboTax software for my annual income tax returns. Unlike other plaintiffs, I did not blindly purchase what I had in past years; I actually did review the supposed capabilities on the box prior to purchasing. TurboTax Deluxe is supposed to have all of the forms I need to complete my taxes, but TurboTax Premium includes extra guidance on investments. I didn't need extra guidance on investments; the forms themselves should be enough, so I bought Deluxe. Well guess what - the forms for investment income are not available in Deluxe, despite the promises on the packaging. Now the software is sticking me up for a $30 upgrade and the help desk says their wait is less than 3 HOURS.
This year I bought Turbo Tax deluxe as I did last year. I started processing tax using the software. Everything was alright until I hit to input my rental home. It said I have to upgrade to Premier version but upgrade is free. So I clicked to do so. It hit the problem and displayed message it having trouble to upgrade and offered a number to call. I called that number and a robot (automated voice) detected my number, asked whether I want them to call me back instead of waiting. I waited for an hour - no representative and you know the same voice periodically saying (call is important to them and someone will be available shortly). So I called from different phone and this time I accepted the offer of calling me back. After 2 hrs one gentleman called and fix the problem of upgrading. Then I entered all the information. Now I have home in Ohio so I wanted to add the state with paying extra. Payment did not work and displayed message it is having trouble to get the payment. So I thought let’s do that later as I don't owe any taxes there. I tried to finish federal and resident state. For state e-file they have 19.99 fee or 34.99 fee if I want to subtract from refund. I decided to pay 19.99 and get the job done. Again payment method did not work and displayed message it is having issue in payment. So I called again the given number and instead of waiting, I asked them to call me back. Since last Saturday I have been doing this sometimes twice a day, no call yet. I got stuck in filing tax this year. I got a feeling that intentionally they did to force the filer to 34.99, it is kind of robbing people by taking hostage. Not sure what to do at this point, I will try couple of more days to see if they got my message and solve the problem. Hopefully thousands of others reading my awful experience and keep away from this piece of junk. I think they were better before with some tolerable bugs but this time is unbearable.
Forced to upgrade online from Deluxe to Premier, then found out their $25 cash back offer does not apply to online users! Why not? We got forced to upgrade just like the CD/Download users did. Not fair at all. And forget trying to call them.
I believe that Intuit is guilty of deceptive marketing. In spite of statements that TT is for Windows and Mac, nowhere on the Intuit website or on their marketing materials does it state that Mac OS X 10.6.8 is not supported. There must be hundreds of thousands (even millions) of users like me that have purchased TurboTax 2014 on CD only to find out it won't work on our perfectly good Macs. The later version of Mac OS X required will not run on Macs currently using 10.6.8 due primarily memory limitations. Having to either buy a new computer or add expensive memory makes using TT a very expensive exercise. If I had known of this limitation, I would have not purchased TurboTax 2014 and my guess is that many thousands of other Mac users would have made the same decision. So instead of making potential customers aware of the incompatibility, Intuit led us into buying the software hoping we would write it off and not pursue a refund. I do not want to prepare my taxes online, I want to get what I paid for, TT on CD, especially when paying $75. Reading other reviews, it appears that the online version does not work on these Macs either. I have used TT for many years but the numerous reviews of up charges and bad customer service in addition to the incompatibility are causing me to strongly consider changing this year.
Turbo Tax Intuit took over $800 that's 40% of my refund. This includes bogus charges just to transmit. I've been on the phone for over 2 1/2 hours still no answer. I've use turbo tax for the last 10 years, never with this experience. I'm just very concerned there's no accountability. What am I to do? Thanks.
Impossible to contact anyone at turbo tax. I have tried for 5 days. They say "high call volume". We will call you back. Not true.
I believe turbo tax was compromised and they will not admit it. I tried to file my federal tax return for 2014 and was told that someone already filed. Turbo tax told me I filed twice, I did not. They charged me 20 bucks to refile my state taxes, but I am not able to. When I called they told me their refund system was down. I will protest with my cc company. I will never use them again.
When filing state tax my credit card could not go through. Called support and was on the phone over thirty minutes for nothing. I had to end the call by going back into the system and have them take 34.99 out of my account for the lack of knowledge through Turbo tax. I would still be on the phone if I didn't go back into the system and pay extra money. No way would I ever use this system again...
I will not use TurboTax again. Their fees were outrageous. I had to split the state taxes and one was for a lawsuit of back wages less than $150. I was charged $35.00 and still owed the other states. I was charged $35.000 for each state, and federal then right at the end, before signing the last page, another $35.00 for bank processing fees. If it's being direct deposit into my bank, why am I paying fees? Never again TurboTax with the suppose fee filing, okay!
I purchased TT Deluxe this year, as I have done for the past 10 years and needed to file the same type of return, but was forced to now pay extra to upgrade to Premier. Now I went to file my state return only to find it would now cost extra and that no state was included in my software. Turbo Tax is gouging customers and I am tired of it, so it looks like I will find a software company that cares about their customers and is fair and upfront about all their charges. GOOD BYE TURBO TAX.
I have used Turbo Tax for many years with no problems. However this year when I installed it, it made the keyboard on my laptop inoperable. Almost every key entered produced a numeric value. I waited for over a half hour three different times to get help from technical service and never was able to speak with anyone that could help. This is deplorable customer service. I followed up with a letter to their VP of customer relations. They have now contacted me but refuse to admit fault and have left me to repair my own laptop which their software corrupted. They also said they would provide a new copy of their system and as of yet I have not received it. This company used to excel at customer service but they are now pathetic. I would not recommend them to anyone.
I don't think I should have to update my OS every year. I did not have to upgrade my system last year. This year I need to buy a new computer to do my taxes? Time to print out the tax forms and do it the old fashion way. Turbo tax is not that helpful. The cost benefit analysis is 2 thumbs down for turbo tax.
I work as a teacher in MA and we do not pay Social Security but we have our own pension plan. When I was preparing our Ma tax return with the MA program, they automatically gave me a $2,000 deduction on line 11 b even though I was not entitled to it. I called Turbo tax and I wrote several emails, but no one answered me. I am a tax preparer so I caught the mistake and will not file the MA forms with them, but I am angry I paid $40.00 for the MA return and I can't use it. There was also another little mistake that I won't go into here, but they should really correct all the mistakes on their MA return and I want a refund of the $40 I paid. An irate client.
After 8 years, I will NEVER use TurboTax again. This year, TT auto populated a $1,100 State tax refund from 2013 and added it as income. I received no State refund in 2013, and, in fact, paid $900. Have been trying 3 times to receive a response from TT. I receive their auto reply stating I will receive an answer, but to date no response. Their customer is non-existent.
I purchase TT after using HR Block for the past 4 years. Before moving to HR Block I was using TT. I have had numerous issue with TT and am regretting the purchase. Issues are listed below: 1. For schedule D transactions, I was forced to upgrade to Premier from Deluxe. With HR Block, Deluxe had the schedule D capability. 2. Premier has numerous errors. I have spent 2 hours with various people with no resolution. Very poor and inefficient customer support. 3. I have interest income from CA muni bond funds. This income is exempt from FED & CA taxes. TT does not recognize that CA interest is tax exempt. 4. I have a large carryover loss on Schedule D. TT does not recognize the carryover loss for CA. This has been very frustrating for me. The problem has not been resolved and the case has been closed. Shame on TT for such poor software and even worse customer support.
Got little help trying to find my "tax timeline". No response from e-mails and didn't get a call back on an incident number.
When putting all info in... I triple checked everything. Especially my account and routing numbers. After not receiving my money, I called bank. They said to check routing numbers. I assured him I had and was positive. But, I checked. The routing number on my form that was submitted is not even close to my actual number! I'm not perfect and might have mistaken 1 number, but not all but 2 of them. Cannot contact TurboTax and they do not return my call as promised. I have no clue what to do.
I have used TurboTax (TT) for years now. In 2012, when I filed using TT and had a legal settlement, they grossly under-calculated my tax obligation. So in 2014 I got notice of back taxes owed. This year, when I used TT to file taxes, they told me I'd get a federal refund. But lo and behold, the IRS is garnishing that due to the back taxes. And I had paid the extra 20 dollars to get a direct deposit to my savings account for the refund. Their software is grossly inaccurate, causing me to pay not only back taxes BUT ALSO penalties and interest on the back taxes, plus they lie to you about your refund status and they take your money for the direct deposit fee without directly depositing the money!!! They truly suck and I will never use them again.
It's bad enough that Intuit pulls a bait and switch by renaming the products and forcing me to make two trips to Costco to get the right version. Now after many hours of frustration uninstalling and re-installing the right (more costly version) a promised call back from tech support has resulted in waiting a day and a half for a call back with no response.
I bought TurboTax Home Business... Tried to download and install and it would not run. When I tried to uninstall, it tried to do a fix which also did not work. Where does TurboTax get off selling software that does not install? It's the very least that should occur in a software program.
I filed a Missouri Tax Return and Turbo said I owed $79.00. I mailed off my check. Next thing I know, I get a check back from Missouri for $495.00. What the **.
Turbo Tax is all messed up for 2014. My hubby has a gross amount and a taxable amount. It would not take the taxable amount and put in the gross amount of his pension. I tried to change it but it still put it in. I didn't discover this until I e-filed it. I had to call the IRS to figure all this out and now how to file an amended return. It has left things off of my return. I put the right amounts in and it looked ok... Once e-filed I printed it and it was right until I checked the printed version and everything had gone back to putting the gross amount in and leaving out the taxable one. He gets retirement from the Firefighters which he retired from. We pay all our own health insurance that comes out of his check... The Fire Dept pays nothing. I have been using this for years never had a problem... You contact them and they never call you back. I won't be using them again.
I have used a TurboTax every year since 1996 without a hitch, until now. All of a sudden, the IRS will not accept our return because according to TurboTax, someone with this taxpayer ID has already filed and been accepted! We are unable to get through to the IRS by phone, don't know how to resolve this.... AND TurboTax says we have to pay more for the premier package.... did it, but still can't get our return accepted by the IRS.
I filed my own simple taxes with TT DLx, but then needed to do fairly simple classroom (college TT 1 cr course reqmts). I couldn't get into online as I attempted to sign on with the ID I had created for either of the two "fictitious" classroom examples. TT takes over everything and doesn't allow you to easily access the forms that are actually being created and updated under the covers, that are the actual data that they're using to complete the return.
My experience with your online Turbo Tax service has been a complete nightmare. I have used Turbotax.com for YEARS and have NEVER had an issue, until now. And it is all because I had to deal with your customer service. TIMELINE: 1/5/15 I started gathering my tax information and inputting it into the online application. 2/9/15 I was ready to complete and file my taxes, and was unable to log into my account because I needed to validate my account with a code. The code was being e-mailed to a VERY OLD email address that I no longer had access to. 2/9/15 - I called to speak to a representative to assist with getting into my Turbo Tax account. The rep assigned an incident number and he transferred me to a new department that was recently assembled to handle account validations. I stayed on hold for 45 MINUTES, and I spoke to another rep, who I thought was a part of the new department, and I answered all her questions and she assigned me ANOTHER incident number, that is when I realized I was never transferred. I was then placed on hold for 2 HOURS and 40 MINUTES, and NO ONE ever came back on the line to assist me. 2/10/15 I called customer service in the morning and waited TWO hours to receive a call back. When the rep got on the phone, I explained my frustrations to her about getting the run around, and I made sure she was located in the appropriate department in order to assist with my log in request. FIVE HOURS LATER, she comes up with the idea of changing my email address. It took your customer service FIVE HOURS to help me, and the solution was to change my email address so I can receive a validation code to log into my account. And the email address change took 2+ days to take effect. It took 5+ DAYS to log into my account, and access my information. 5+ DAYS!?!? What kind of assistance is that? At the end of the 5 hour call the rep offered to refund me for my 2013 and 2014 filing taxes for the hassle, wait time, and inconvenience this entire experience caused. 2/17/15 - I finally am able to log into my account, and file my taxes, when it asks for me to pay I realize the rep never gave me a service code to input, so I do not have to pay for the 2014 taxes. 2/17/15 I called customer service and it took 4 hours to receive a call back. I tried giving my old incident numbers that were closed, to the rep, so she could review the notes and assist with giving me a service code. That was I could pay Turbo Tax and file my 2014 state and federal tax returns. I explained to her what happened, and asked for a service code, or at least confirmation that I will in fact receive a refund for my 2014 if I file and pay. I wanted to make sure it was notated in the incident notes, so I did not have any issues with getting a refund. 30 minutes of back and forth, where she wants to help, but needed assistance, she says she is unable to help me because refunds/service codes are only given if there are problems using the service. She then went on to explain how I can file for free by not filing my state taxes, and home and business federal taxes with Turbo Tax, then it would be free. Which I am still confused why she would suggest that, and whether or not she even knew what I was asking for assistance with. Since I was at work and didn't have time to RE EXPLAIN the problems I encountered using your online service, and she clearly wasn't interested in reviewing the incident notes, or listening, I hung up and decided to call back at a more convenient time and location. 2/18/15 I called at 7:30am, I called at 12:00pm, I called at 4:30 pm, no call back, no call back attempts. 2/19/15 I called at 7am, I called at 9am, I submitted an online request to be contacted at 10am, I called again at 11:15am, and decided to wait on hold since Turbo Tax customer service reps do not know how to return peoples calls. As of 2/19/15 I have called a total of 8 times, using 3 different ways to contact customer service and I have still not received a call back from Turbo Tax's customer service. I do not understand what I am paying for. I cannot get a customer service rep to pick up the phone or even call me back. Your system states that I am being placed in the queue and you will return my call so I don't have to wait on hold. Why doesn't anyone call me back? All I would like to do is file my taxes. Because of this non sense it has taken TWO ADDITIONAL WEEKS just to file my taxes. TWO WEEKS of dealing with your customer service, and who knows when or if there is an end in sight.
Where to begin??? This was and is the first time using and the last time using turbo tax. Nothing but problems. It cost me a ton of money after it was suppose to be free. Turbo tax sent an email stating my taxes were accepted on the 23 of January but irs claims they were never received in there off until the 4th of February. I never received my direct deposit the day I was suppose to. I call irs and along with many others that used tt. Mines was picked for a review so now I have to wait up to 5 weeks for my refund. I should have known something was shady about tt when they claimed they can get me more back than H & R block, after many years of using the block I have never had any problems. People take the advice of the many who are commenting here DO NOT use TURBO TAX.. By the way already got word from the state tt said I was getting back 295, Well I'm getting back a big fat ZERO amount. Where are these errors coming from.
Before anyone lets themselves get as upset as I was over the TurboTax changes, I would strongly suggest that you place a call to Intuit's customer service line. Believe me, I was extremely upset over their software changes and I placed a call to Intuit intending on strongly voicing my displeasure. However, by the time the call ended, I immediately decided to remain a loyal TurboTax customer. Not only did they address my issue to my satisfaction, they took full responsibility for their error and sincerely apologized for the issue. I am retired from GE where I held a Director of Service position. I have considerable experience in customer satisfaction and am very capable of identifying the difference between a standard boiler plate apology message versus a sincere effort to "make the situation right" and Intuit truly did make it right in my case. Again, I suggest that you place a call to Intuit and you be pleasantly surprised with the results.
I have been buying Intuit products for more than 15 years (ie Quickbooks, with assisted payroll, Quicken, TurboTax Business, and Personal) and this year have discovered the issues everyone else has with TurboTax. I tried to call the 877 number, stayed on hold for more than 30 minutes, and after waiting for so long I opted to be called back. No call has ever been made. I tried to get the "free upgrade" through TurboTax since it was available on 2/17/15 but couldn't because I had to get a confirmation number from customer support, that never answered the call or never called back. I waited for 2 days with no response and now needed to move on with my taxes. Instead of waiting, I made the purchase, with the anticipation of getting at least $25 back from their website. I tried that route and found I was not eligible. Why, I don't know. I've filed electronically with them for over 15 years. I think the almighty dollar has gotten in the way of providing the end user with the ability to do the work we once were able to. For myself, someone who spends almost $4,000 a year with Intuit for their products I think it's time to begin looking at other companies and their product offerings. I hear Xero is another accounting software, and I'm sure they would love to take the market share for someone who is now taking advantage of the consumer.
Takes over 3 hours to get a human being on phone. Then the person on phone is mentally handicapped. Then takes another 45 minutes to get a supervisor. Then supervisor rude.
I filed online and went to check on my refund. The IRS reports that I never filed. I tried to get in online to find out what was going on but they said my password was incorrect and never sent anything to my email or span folder but a 6-digit number that didn't work. The 800 customer service number said it would call me back and disconnected. No calls back. I left several different numbers and monitored them all. I am going to complain to every available resource and will seek legal counsel if this is not resolved.
Have used Turbotax for many years and have referred all of my friends to use it. This year I bought the basic which I have always used and now it will not compute 1099- B taxes without upgrading to the highest priced version. I have wasted my money on the basic and now have to pay another $70.00 for the higher priced version in order to compute my form 1099-B. This seems like a rip off to me and it destroys my trust in TurboTax. How sad.
Beware there is a big mistake on the questions on the California State tax program. When you fill out the Head of Household questionnaire, they ask if the dependent made more than $3900 which is NOT the Federal deduction and if you go directly to the form it shows the correct amount of $3950. This is going to cause a LOT of problems for people who do not know the laws and maybe cause an audit or worse not allow people to get all the deductions they deserve because of the error. BEWARE.....Turbo tax needs to fix this!!!!!!!
I filled my tax return via Turbo website and initially they started with 0 fees and then all of sudden I need to upgrade or I cannot file. I did upgrade and filed it. Now I have some questions which might result in amendment but I am trying to reach to them since 2-3 days without any success. They put you on hold for hours every time. They do not even have email support where we can send email and get replies. Just making a good software cannot make you best company.
I filed my State and federal Tax using Turbo tax almost 2 weeks ago. I contacted the MA department of revenue, only to be told that they have not received my Taxes. I was also made aware that Turbo Tax has been under investigation for fraudulent activities. I have been unable to contact Turbo tax to see why they are holding my taxes.
I've used Turbo Tax for years. This year I purchased a CD. When processing taxes I discovered I needed an upgrade due to capital gains. Couldn't process upgrade via the internet. Turbo Tax program said it was my internet connection. Didn't have connectivity trouble with anything else. Program gives a phone number and an option to purchase over the phone. After being on hold for what seemed like forever, I discovered they will not let me purchase an upgrade if I don't provide my email address. They don't need that. I am not signing in online and I don't want their junk in my inbox. They actually refused the sale. WOW! I will be moving on to a new tax software.
After reading about everyone problems with TT, no wonder I had to wait an hour for no help! I think my best bet will be to use H&R next year. Another 15 year+ user bids G O O D BYE!
I filed my tax return using Turbo Tax, the customer service is the worst.. You're better off using a free service. They charge over a hundred dollars in fees for services that IRS offers for free.. If you make an error good luck fixing it. I want a full refund.
I have used TurboTax since 2006. When I went in this year, a message popped up recommending home and business. I did the whole thing and learned at the end that my fee is double what I usually pay. The only way to rectify it seems is to clear and start over! I can't see any other way around it. I cannot get an answer from the Community as TurboTax seems to control that now, and I do not see a chat option.
I was charged an extra 34.99 without ever agreeing to it. So I never submitted my efile and waited 45 minutes to be told to call back tomorrow to request a refund. The next day I waited 1 hour and 38 minutes, I was promised a confirmation email which I never received. On call number 3 and it’s over 2 hours to just get a refund I taxes I never filed.
I have to say, I am very satisfied with my experience with Turbo Tax! This year was my first year filing taxes, so I decided to file them myself, considering the fact that I only had one W2 form to report. The step to step program is great for those of us who don't know anything about taxes. It guides you through all the questions, while explaining how and when they apply to you and where you can find that information. On top of the fact that I paid absolutely no fees, it was extremely easy to use. I was so happy with my experience that I decided to do my mother's taxes with her utilizing the same, free program. My mother has a job, student loan interest that she pays, a mortgage, property taxes, work-related expenses, a dependent, and she qualifies for Earned Income Credit... With all of this in consideration, you would figure that her taxes would be a little more complicated than mine. WRONG. The program guided me through with such simple questions that I actually filed her taxes in almost the same amount of time that I did mine. The whole "maximum refund guaranteed" comes off as a little over-hyped, but to be completely honest, we were able to find more exemptions and returns with the program, and her refund was bigger than it was last year... Last year she went to a public accountant, which meant she actually had to pay the lady a nice amount of money to do them for her. Well, I did them without any charge, and actually found more than that accountant! Overall, very satisfied.
I used TurboTax Deluxe this year and got billed for home/business, and last year also.
I am really disappointed with Turbo Tax. Each year the fees to file change right when you go to efile. This year may be my last year with Turbo tax. I chose the correct status for me and it chose The Deluxe. I go through the whole process and come to find out that I am being charged more than what it would cost to buy a CD at the store not the price that was on the online site. $73.00. $36.00 each for Federal and State when one was supposed to be free? Even the online choice for Deluxe said or now says $59.99. I got in before the 16th. Then you charged me $34.99 to take it from my tax return? I was charged over a hundred dollars to file. That has never happened before and will never happen again. I will be using a different service from now on. Very disappointed.
There seems to be a bug in the Premier TurboTax software. I am unable to import rental property information from my Federal return into my CA tax return. In the online forum, a TurboTax employee has noted they are aware of the problem. You can locate the item in the forum by searching for the item's title: CA: Rental property appears to not transfer to state return, causes confusion. The problem was initially reported by another user three weeks prior to my encounter with it on 2/15. If might be helpful if they could publish an update on that same forum so those of us affected would know if the problem will or can be fixed before April 15. I did follow the link and filed a trouble ticket with them a day ago, but I really doubt if I'll hear anything from them. If I cannot get status on this issue, I will be forced to use H&R Block to do my CA return. That's a shame because I am a loyal customer and, being a computer programmer, I appreciate how difficult it must be to ensure 100% quality with a complex product like TurboTax. I would expect some bugs. A good company expects problems and should be well prepared to properly handle them. That's all most people want, just competent service if a problem arises.
I am trying to get the program to update on the schedule F so that vehicle deductions can be taken, hitting the update merely refreshed the page (see screen shot of the page). I can get no response online pertaining to my dilemma. In the past I have had no such issues with TurboTax. I've lost a day now, trying to finish my taxes. Since they won't return my call to figure out why there is a software problem, both of my college students (son and daughter) may lose $1000's in FAFSA funding. When I waste my time using a software system out of which the manufacturer has not worked the bugs, I'd like to be compensated for my time expenditure.
I was helping a friend do his 2014 taxes. I have used TurboTax for the last 6-7 years and always recommend the product to anyone who asks. However, this year I noticed every time we entered a deduction or credit his refund would get smaller. It went from $2300 to $1400. I could never get it to recalculate or refresh even after logging off and logging back in again. Finally went to H&R Block and entered the same information. He is now getting $3000. I have no clue what is going on but that is a very good way to lose your business very fast.
First of all I received an offer from my bank for a discount so I click the link and it shows the discount but when check out it charged me the full price. Tried contacting the customer service and no call after 2 hours even though it said call back time less than 30 minutes. So moving forward, I paid for deluxe download version with 5 federal and 1 free state efile. After filling my first federal and state it ask me if I want to use my free state efile, I clicked ok but at the end it was charging me after 19.99 for state and another 34.99 processing fee. Remember I already bought and paid for the software with my credit card so there's no reason for them to be charging me another extra fees. And I even choose the option for my check to be mailed just to make sure I'm not been charged direct deposit fees. Turbo tax seems like running a scam and thinking no one will notice. I'm going to be talking with my lawyer this afternoon and planning to file a civil lawsuit against them and their parent company intuit.
Turbo Tax Basic always had the basic forms, A, B,C, D etc. although they always tried to pressure you to buy the Deluxe version. Now in 2015 the "Basic" has disappeared and 1040EZ takes its place without even schedule A! What kind of tax program is that? Even the so called Deluxe form does not have D which is pretty Basic form. All this is not advertised anywhere openly. After many years of Turbo Tax I'm done, it's TaxAct for me.
Decided to do my own taxes this year and gave TurboTax a go. No accounting or finance background required. The website will walk you through the filing process and double-check your responses along the way. The website will also upload your W2 information for most well-known employers. The website will then import your Federal responses directly onto your State filing. The whole filing process for Federal and State was seamless and quick. The price was also very reasonable considering CPAs charge significantly more. There is also an audit probability check at the very end of the filing process that is very comforting. I really enjoyed doing my taxes this year and highly recommend TurboTax.
Used TurboTax to do my taxes because it said that they are fast and easy. ALSO 100% accurate (their words not mine) but that's not the case. I set direct deposit with them. They can't do it. They only tried one time to send it there since it didn't go through (and they only try one time and charge you for it if it didn't go through. B.S) but now you gotta send a bill to the Stupid ** at TurboTax or who ever (they have another company process your money or what not). If you are like me and live with someone and no bills in your name good luck but after they get your bill it will take 3 days or so to process that. Then guess what you still have to wait 4 to 6 weeks on top of that. I'm pretty pissed. It says fast, easy and 100% accurate not true. I think I should be able to get my money back from them. Lesson learned. Never use the peace of ** TurboTax more like a pinto tax. Haha. Hope this helps you guys.
Intuit Turbo Tax is calculating my taxes off my total income and not my taxable income. All the information is input correctly, so there has to be a programming bug of some kind. Very frustrating. First year in a decade I'm not using this program.
I've called Turbo Tax and checked my return...I put in my bank account information correctly, but I never received my refund. I went to the IRS and they printed out the information that they have. Apparently my money went to some strange account that I have no awareness of. I called that bank and they stated that it was part of the e-file process. They acted like I said something insane when I said that I had never received my refund. After talking to their taxpayer service, they explained that I was not the only person this had happened to. I still don't have my refund.
I entered all of my income and expenses, however I did not file because I wanted to check one other item. Received an update notice & updated. Went back to return and all schedule a & b info was gone.
For the past 3 years I have had problems with TurboTax's Schedule R. For some reason it has always been difficult to use this form. No questions asked in the interview processes pertaining to this form. The last couple of years, I have at the very least been able to find and use it. Now, I get an error message stating that it is not supported. I can't e-file with it and worst of all, can no longer print a pdf of the return with it. It took me time to research a customer support phone# which redirected me to the IRS website. I then researched more to find **. I called a phone # after receiving an incident ID# **, called it and received a recording to either press 1 for a return call or stay on the line for a rep (not realizing that 45 minutes later, still no rep). So I called back, pressed 1 and still no help after 1/2 a day.
I always use TurboTax and have never had a problem until now! Last year we imported our W2s, added all our info then the program computed our EIC, child tax and student credit. I was excited because it said we will get money back. Well guess who got audited and now has to pay back the money their system said we were entitled to. We are devastated!
I bought TurboTax Deluxe, as I always have, and found out AFTER THE FACT that I needed to upgrade to another edition. I did that... BEFORE the company made it available FREE... and it cost me $42.50. My taxes are now done and ready to mail [I have to mail it because of two necessary "overrides"]. The TurboTax refund website CANNOT verify that I am entitled to the $25.00 refund, so I just spent 2 hours 45 minutes ON HOLD waiting to speak with a warm body. Ultimately, I've spent time and $92.50 for a $25.00 refund. Something is wrong here somewhere, and I can guarantee with 100% certainty I will NEVER use TurboTax again. N-E-V-E-R.
Did you know that if you file jointly, any federal loans in default that your spouse may have can cause your entire refund to be seized by both state and federal agencies? I surely didn't. Much to my surprise, this product that is purportedly created to assist taxpayers without formal training file their taxes appropriately--by prompting the user with appropriate questioning to evaluate their best interest in regards to filing their taxes--did not mention anything to this effect during my filing process. It didn't even ask if either of us had federal or state obligations (such as loans, taxes, etc). All my refund money is gone, and certainly I hold TurboTax responsible for this. I filed the corrective forms (without the help of this product) and I will receive notice in THREE MONTHS if corrective measures will be taken by state and federal agencies. Needless to say, I am spellbound by the lack to detail and thought this company has put into this product. I can't even contact customer service to file a complaint with the actual company. I believe I should be reimbursed by this company ($2,100 in total) for defrauding me into believing they could properly and accurately assist me in filing my taxes this year.
I had several questions to speak with a Turbo tax representative about concerning 1099 forms. I spent hours on hold only to be hung up on twice when they answered the phone. No one attempted to call me back. On the third attempt I made to call (again, waited hours to receive a call back), I got in contact with someone who obviously had no idea what they were doing and I requested to speak with a supervisor. I was informed that the supervisor was busy at the present time and would have to return my phone call. Once again, I said, okay. Never received a return phone call. Next day I attempted to call again and after hours of waiting, I finally got in contact with someone who I thought might actually be able to help me. The representative stated they would send me an email confirming what we had discussed and advise me on how to proceed online (since I wasn't at a computer at that time). The representative confirmed my email address and phone number with me before hanging up the phone. Guess what... never received that email. I checked my junk mailbox, trash, etc....never received a single thing. I finally just called my credit card company and asked them to dispute the charge for me ever even purchasing turbo tax. I had such a horrendous experience with turbo tax. I swear I will never use nor recommend them to anyone in the future! Terrible service, if you can even call it that.
I paid TurboTax $19.95 to file my state returns and the state will not accept them because one, the schedules has to be filed by mail Per TurboTax policy. I cannot get a refund from them. I have been a long time TurboTax user but I will no longer use the product.
Used TurboTax for years. Well tried to e-file only to find out that a hacker has already filed and accepted with my social. I do not know if they received my refund but now I am stuck proving who I am, all because TurboTax allowed their system to be hacked. Never again!!
I have filed the last 4 years with Turbo Tax. I will say I am young and have little sense of these things. My first two years went great, one small charge for state and I got my money within 2 weeks! It went downhill last year, I told myself I would just go to some tax guy if I was going to have to pay anyways but I was impulsive and wanted the money. I filed in 2 states so I was charged twice (which I made literally 200 dollars in another state so it was like a total of 25 and I had to pay 36 but whatever). I opted to take that out of my refund. A box popped up for an additional 44.95. I denied it, but it charges me anyways and when I tried to go back and take it off it would not let me continue. I didn't want audit protection. I'm a student. Byyyye turbo tax I'm going to a human next year!
The fee kept growing. I paid almost $150.00 when I added audit protection. I noticed last year, they made a mistake and put property taxes as an extra did get. This caused me to have everything itemized and not standard deduction. What a mess. How did this happen? Now later, I will have to correct it with amendment even though I do not owe anything. Still, a mess. Yes they have changed and very sneaky. Hoping I will hear something. I filed on 4th and need our money like everyone does. They give no help on EIC supporting an adult with disability. Pass the buck. I don't know why I agreed to the fee A certificate, Second thoughts, Never again.
I worked for Jackson Hewitt for 3 yrs and did my return with them. This year, I didn't, and decided to buy TurboTax instead. I bought it at Wal-Mart, bought the deluxe because I have rental properties, sold them, in installment basis. It took me hours and hours to do it, and I finally gave up. The program won't recognize 2 different houses in same street. After I finished the first house, and get to the second house, the data I put in from the first house is popping up, I erase it and put the second house data, only to find out, it erase the data of the first house. Then I put it again, and then it's telling me to put the amount together, so I tried it that way, but I can't combine two names, they are separate houses, different people. I called tech support, online suggests to put my question online because of high volume of call. Somebody else will answer your question, which I never got an answer. I called again, talk to a machine, left a number to call, called me back after 4 hrs, I just want my money back. He said he can't refund me because I bought it in the store. Wal-Mart said, they don't refund software. So, I asked him to connect me to tech support, waited more than 30 minutes, then this lady wanted me to go turn on the computer so she can look at it, I was outside grilling, really. I told her I just want my money back, I need the address. She took my email address, saying she will email me the instruction and address to send it. I didn't get an email, but I asked her the address, she did not say any instruction on how to send it, I got the address. Will I send it to this address and Will not get my money back anyway because I missed some instructions? Never trust Intuit, if they have high volume of call, something is wrong with their program, not a user friendly.
My pension income was shown as W-2 wages and cannot correct this error. As a result for NY purposes, New York City pensions are exempted and the incorrect reflection as W-2 income results in a tax of $470.00 instead of a refund of $125. In prior years there was a way to override turbo tax errors. For 2014, there does not seem to be able to do so. Requested help from your supposed experts and have not been helped.
I've been using TT Deluxe for years. Last year, Deluxe Fed+State was one package for 49.95. This year close to double that. I know that the bottom line is dollars for such companies and that you have the upper hand for now. Next year, people will vote with their feet by tap dancing over to another more honest and reputable company. The State software had to be downloaded for an additional $42.79.
Bought their Premier and was preparing taxes and when it got to "Business Expenses," it asked for another $10.00! So I had to stop and pay the $10.00 toll. I already paid over $100.00 for this software and have used it since the 80's. I'm very disappointed in Intuit's stance on this. If anything, I would think they'd give me a $10.00 Customer Loyalty discount.
I used TurboTax to create both federal and state tax returns. I reported the correct interest income amount in the appropriate interest income box in TurboTax. The federal return properly reflects the interest income amount, however, the PA State return reflect an overstatement of 1069. I spent hours on phone with TurboTax to identify the issue. They cannot resolve and cannot explain where this additional $1069 was extracted. I did not report any other type of dividend, tax exempt or other interest income, nor is this $1069. Amount tied to any prior years reporting. TurboTax charged me $36.99 for the State filing and they cannot correct the error.
For the first time in many years, I am dissatisfied (actually angry) about Turbotax Deluxe and the required $30 extra to upgrade it. I returned my disks using the address in the "Satisfaction Guarantee" section. However, the package was returned to me because the address does NOT accept mail. It is a fake address (Greenville, SC). I went online and will try a different return address (Pleasant Prairie, WI). Maybe this will work.
After using another website for several years, I decided to try TurboTax again. Everything went smoothly until I paid my filing fee for my spouse and I. I had no option for printing a receipt. Thinking the next screen would show "ready to e-file", I was shocked to read that because of problems on my federal return, I would have to mail the return in. I selected "fix problems" but instead of re-opening my return, the next screen returned me to the state endorsement page. This went on in circles for several minutes upon which I just exited the website. I found a customer service number to call but when I dialed that number a lady answered saying this was the wrong Turbotax office to handle my problem and she gave me another number to call. That number was in "overload". So I left my home number for someone to call me. The return call came just a short while later but the young lady sounded like she was a million miles from me. I could barely hear her and told her so. She continued to talk with no improvement and I hung up. Now calling back today, I get an automatic phone system message said that I cannot make that call from my area code so TurboTax must be limiting their incoming calls to help their so-called efficiency! Hah!!
We have used Turbo Tax for many years to file our taxes electronically without a problem until this year! Our taxes are a mess! I cannot even take them elsewhere to efile them, as it says they have already been filed using Turbo Tax, however; Turbo Tax rejected them! I am not talking state taxes here folks; I am talking Federal! Now, I am a mess, a bundle of nerves, NOT HAPPY! Is my information safe, or is it being spread over the web or on The black market to defraud me? Not to mention paper filing our taxes... and waiting on the results! Waiting! Waiting!
False advertising to say the least. I have used the software for a couple years now. Every single year I am charged for this "free" software. It might be free, for anyone other than the average American who owns a home, has a couple deductions or even a home based business. The software made me update to home and business for a fee of 79.99, then charged 34.99 for state!! I did not file business taxes so I tried to drop it after waiting forever with customer service - I was informed I would have to start over again!!! After all was said and done, my "FREE" taxes came to 106.00. TurboTax is smearing others names in the mud with their false advertising and I'll never file with them again.
I began filing my 2015 tax return with TurboTax. When I opted to have the prep fees deducted from my refund, they charged me an additional $34.99 and were going to file my taxes electronically. When I removed that option and paid on the spot, they immediately brought me back to my returns and said if I didn't fix the problems at hand, I would have to file by mail. This is the same return they were willing to file electronically seconds ago as is. They have deducted the fees amassing $77.02 and I haven't yet completed my return. I am not able to talk to a customer service agent and I am not able to file my taxes electronically. I am now out of $77.02 and my taxes are yet to be filed. TurboTax starts out on the false premise that they are a free software, then midway in filing your return, they deduct money from your refund if you opt out of using the Deluxe software. State is an additional fee and having the fees deducted from your refund is an additional fee. By TurboTax is done, you would have been better off financially going to a tax expert to complete your taxes. I would encourage you to stay away from TurboTax.
I have been using Turbo Tax since 2008 and started off paying $25.99. I filled my taxes this year and ended up paying $145.00!! Are you kidding me? I do all the work and I still had to pay that much!!! They sit here and say they're free and they even put a graph up on their site comparing themselves to HR block price wise. Well it would have cost me less to go to HR block and let them do all the work!!! So never again will I use Turbo Tax!!!
Mid January 2015, I started my husband and my taxes on Turbo Tax. We didn't have all the necessary paperwork so I had to wait a few weeks to finish. Last week, Feb 5th, I met an individual who explained to me that his wife started their taxes on Turbo Tax but they too had to wait a few days for all the rest of the information to finish. When they did hit submit, they received an error back from the IRS that their return was already submitted days ago. They claim to have not done it then. They then went back into Turbo Tax to do some research, found out their refund had not been issued to their bank account as instructed, but to a Pre-Paid debit card instead. They insisted it was fraud but TT told them to contact the IRS. Well hearing this, plus TT being taken down from submitting any returns over last weekend and the fact that I listed myself first on the return, my husband decided to start all over with Tax Act. He filed the return but then got the same error, "your return was already filed." We immediately jumped on the TT site to investigate and it said our return was submitted Jan 29, 2015. We waited over an hour via computer to type to an associate who told us they hired an outside security firm that proved they were not at fault. I have now reached out to Facebook to see who else this might of happen too and so far there's quite a few from all over the United States. Same details, submitted returns to a pre-paid debit card with it not being the rightful people. I have started a rant on Facebook in which, I'm finding more and more people this has happen too.
Files taxes with Turbo Tax...e-filed. Return was processed, supposed to be deposited to my account... Found that 72.45 was taken out. Part fed agency... but the rest should have been deposited. Went to IRS. Rep said it was Turbo Tax holding up the deposit because they took their portion for doing my taxes... Like a RAL... he said. So no notice of when it will go on my card... Been calling Turbo Tax #... No answer or live person... You are on hold... Music playing... 30 min... almost hour... I'm pissed.
I have been using Turbo Tax since 1994 when it was on the large floppy discs. I chose this as my way of helping people who needed help. I did some on my computer as well as going to people's homes and helping them. I saved copies of all taxes on my hard drive, A TAX FILE from 1994 until A TAX FILE 2013 and all files are still in tact, until the ones that I need for this year. When I pull up A TAX FILE 2014, it has TWO BUSINESS RETURNS ONLY. Does anyone know how I can get these files back? I had all files both on hard drive on computer, and on a portable hard drive. I am 76.5 years old now, and I am done with Turbo Tax. This problem will probably do me in, in a hurry.
After 10+ years of using TT Basic, they decided to remove the Schedule A (itemized deductions) from the BASIC software! It now prompts me to upgrade to TT Deluxe (another $30!) They have just lost a loyal customer. I'll look into H&R Block or TaxAct. The Wall Street Journal article about the controversy. Google "TurboTax Triggers a Revolt" **.
I've been using Intuit Turbo Tax for years. I normally purchase the Deluxe to file Federal and State Taxes without any surprises. This year I did the same, purchased the Deluxe expecting to pay the normal $19.99 to file my state taxes via efile, but to my surprise a screen popped up before I could access my state portion asking to pay $39.99 which I thought was weird. They asked for my name address, etc. On this screen I did not enter my CC information. Then my refund amount showed up which was nice then it asked how I wanted to file, E-File for $19.99 or If I wanted the filing fee deducted out of my refund they'd charge $39.99. So like always I paid by Credit card the $19.99. Wow that was easy... until I looked at my account online to find out they charged me the $39.99 plus the $19.99. WHAT THE HECK! I called and of course they were busy so they kept me in the Queue and I got a call back about 4 hrs later. The girl I spoke to was nice and I told her they charged me the $39.99 on top of the $19.99. She looked at my charges and said it was correct. I said "what is the $39.99 charge for" and she said it was the access fee to file the state and the $19.99 was to E-File my return. WHAT! I told her in all the years I've been using Turbotax Deluxe I've never paid anything other than the $19.99 to efile. Long story short she said she'd refund me $15.00, and I told her I should get back the $39.99 since I paid by CC, she gave me a bunch of scenarios about why I was charged the charges. BEWARE... yes you file Free Federal and yes you can file State, they just don't mention they charge you access to the State on top of the E-Filing Fees. The Scenario she gave me was: When we purchase Turbo Tax from the store or wherever essentially we own it, and family members etc could use the disc. Now if we were to file online using their website we don't own it. So the charges for filing online would be more and we wouldn't have to pay to access the state return. Next year I will definitely look at H&R BLOCK to file my taxes. All the emails and advertising Intuit Turbo Tax tells the public is totally misleading...
Purchased the premier edition, like we have every year. Well this year Turbo Tax changed this program and didn't tell anyone. I get a 1099 and in past years this version included this. Well this year it didn't. So I called customer service and they admitted they changed the program and I would have to purchase the upgrade. What a scam. Had they mentioned that on the box I would have purchased the correct version to begin with. The customer service rep was far less than helpful and when I asked to speak with a supervisor I was told they were much too busy to speak with me. They would call me back. That was two weeks ago and I'm still waiting. Have used program over 10 years and next year I am firing Turbo Tax and will find someone who actually cares about their customers. SHAME on you Turbo Tax and your crummy customer service.
I've used TurboTax Deluxe for 12 years. They are charging more this year than ever before for their product when everyone else is lowering their price. Then they charge almost $20 for each submittal. Then they email us a halfhearted email apology - offering a $25 "please forgive us" refund so we won't leave them..... only to be informed we don't qualify. Goodbye TurboTax...... Hello Tax Cut for 2015!!
I am surprised the download version of Turbo Tax can only be downloaded onto two computers. Normally, I purchase the disk and can share it with my sisters. Will not buy the download version again. Hope this is not a practice of the company that will continue to the future.
Used to be great...now just flat out sneaky about their fees. Of course - it should not be free...but ...really bad. Go to H&R Block.
The software wasn't able to complete the transaction. The help screen gave me the number to call and required information to complete the transaction over the phone. However, the automated switchboard wasn't helpful, only time consuming. I was able to get to the automated operator where I was told that I would get one return call. Never happened, at least not yet. Not knowing when I would have my problem resolved, I filed my returns by OKing the fee being deducted from my return, which costs another $35. That's a whole other complaint. I may go back to doing it by hand and save $100.
As others have reported, this year Intuit is requiring an additional upgrade to complete a fairly standard return. For years, I've been using the Turbotax Deluxe version. It's been more expensive, but I understand that extra schedules warrant extra cost. This year, they decided that the Deluxe package wasn't sufficient, and require me to upgrade even higher up their food chain. Although they are offering a free upgrade (in an attempt to pacify their unhappy customers), their website won't support the free upgrade without speaking with a customer service rep. at their convenience (M-F 'normal' hours). Pretty inconvenient- especially since they are the ones who initiated the special handling requirement.
How does Intuit get away with advertising zero fees when I couldn't file until I paid $72!!! At least 3 previous times, it stated I couldn't file unless I upgraded to Deluxe. After an hour of my time, I had no choice but to upgrade on the 4th time or they weren't going to let me finish. THEN, I had to agree to a $37 fee to file federal/state together. But they advertised it was free. To make matters worse, I owe on federal. There is no separate fee for just filing one tax return. I couldn't print and mail the State. I want my money back!!!!!!! Intuit should get in major trouble for this fraudulent advertising and forced upgrade. I felt like my taxes were help hostage! Why am I paying taxes anyway? I work, yet every year my taxes go up and my net income goes down. Add insult to injury I had to pay fees to pay the government who in turn charges me a fee for not allowing them to earn 4% interest every two weeks. CRAZY!
Free upgrade from Deluxe to Premier on 2/7/2015 is not exactly what Intuit is advertising. The free upgrade to Premier requires you purchased Deluxe edition in 2013. TurboTax Basic handled my Capital Gains in 2013. I did purchase Deluxe in 2014 but don't qualify for the upgrade because I purchased Basic in 2013 and every year prior since 1999. Call and complain, took 2 hours for a call back and the person didn't have an answer. Intuit just lost a 15 year customer.
TurboTax Deluxe 2014 will tell you it's free to e-file both federal and state returns. Not true. At the "filing" step, to continue, you will be prompted to deduct the $19.99 filing fee either by subtracting it from a refund, OR, you can pay via credit card. If you choose the subtract from refund option, you can proceed only by agreeing to AN ADDITIONAL fee of $34.99! These 2 hidden fees exceeded what I initially paid for the TurboTax software. Beyond this misrepresentation, the link to the e-file PIN was dead (this PIN is required to file). Had to go the IRS website to get my PIN. A complete ripoff. Stay away from this fraudulent, faulty product.
This morning, Feb 7, while preparing my tax return I was having numerous problems. Last year, for the first time, I filed our return using the online version of TurboTax versus buying the CD. After numerous struggles I reached out to the support staff and talked to a lady to resolve my problems. Bottom line, someone efiled my federal tax return on February 5th using TurboTax software. The TT folks went to great lengths with me to insist that this could have happened to anybody, that the hack has nothing to do with them. I filed an affidavit with the IRS 14039, called the local police department and filed a report, filled out a report online with the FTC, and contacted the credit reporting companies to alert them to my identity theft. Nothing is showing anywhere else in my files. Only this hack of my name and social and the fact that I am unable to access my 2013 filings with TurboTax, because someone has gotten the information and blocked me from accessing it.
I've been a loyal TT user for over 15 years and over the past two years have had difficulties sorting out the correct product to use for my taxes. Not because of anything I didn't understand, but because of the convoluted way Intuit has chosen to move forward with it's products. Not only TurboTax but Quicken as well. This is the last year that I am using TurboTax. I'm moving to a more customer friendly company. Intuit as a corporation has lost my loyalty and my business forever. Never again will I use TurboTax and when I find a product that I can replace Quicken with I'm moving to that as well. Goodbye Intuit. It's been great knowing ya.
I bought the TurboTax Basic at Costco, because I complete and file my Ohio State Taxes on line from the Federal forms. The product changed from last year and the packaging it is not clear that it is only for 1040EZ/A. I thought the A indicated 1040 Schedule A. TurboTax Basic leads you through the all the deduction information (property taxes, donations, personal property for business use, etc.) and calculates the itemized deduction. It shows what the standard deduction would bring and the itemized deduction and then forces you to upgrade to Deluxe in lieu of printing Schedule A. It is a racket. They offer you a download of Deluxe for $40 more which is the same price as the CD (no product cost to them). What a joke! Be careful because there is no Schedule D without spending even more on the Premier version. I have been using this product for years upon years. They have continually raised the price and now they are forcing you do pay more for features they moved to the Deluxe version. They want to get that $50+ out of your pocket every year even though it is basically the same software product with some updated tax tables and goofy graphics. What a POS. Read the fine print on the back and save your receipt, which I did not. Otherwise, Intuit would get it returned!
I bought the locally installed TurboTax Basic 2014. This is the version I have used for many years. 1. The program is buggy. It is installed but now won't run. I click the desktop icon and nothing happens. I click on the tax file itself, still nothing. The program had problems installing as originally downloaded but cured itself long enough to let me enter some 2014 tax data. After the next program update (yes, there are many), it quit working again and is dead. I tried the TurboTax Repair / Uninstall program to repair. It ran for a while and then quit with a message there was an "unexpected error". I then ran the uninstall program; goodbye TurboTax. I am switching to Tax Act. 2. Basic TurboTax, which I paid for and have used for years, will no longer do my return. It no longer handles Schedule C or Schedule D.. That version now costs $79. Another Goodbye TurboTax.
I had a complicated return this year. Well to me it was complicated. My husband moved to Mississippi in May, I stayed back in Illinois until Jan, so we had to file two states, and federal. I suppose I can make this short. I didn't want to add audit defense, but somehow it got added $44.95. I wanted it filed, so I had to pay BOTH states and upgrade because we had a mortgage and just got married, etc. I understood that part. Then I wanted it direct deposit and fees removed from my return, another $34.95. Granted our return is 5k+. I was still upset when it was all said and done - something that shouldn't be that expensive was $188.00. I couldn't go back to remove audit defense so I sucked that up. This company advertises ILLEGALLY. I can say that for I am in the legal field. There is a class action suit here.
I have used TT for the past three years with no problem. This year has ruined it for me. IRS approved refund and it said your refund will be deposited in your bank on 1/30/2015. I kept looking in bank and nothing. This went on for days till I broke down and called IRS and TurboTax. So Turbo sends me to IRS so after hours of trying to find a live person to talk to and many tears, I finally got to the IRS. They said I'm showing that TurboTax put it in their bank to collect their fees and then should have already sent it to your bank. So he told me to call that bank and he even gave me the account number and routing number that TurboTax put it in. I called and not only were they rude but because I rounded the number off on my refund they refuse to talk to me. So then they requested me and my husband send in our ID and SS cards which we had lost years ago. So we had to drive out of our way to go apply for a SS card. The "SUPERVISOR" at this bank said a receipt showing where we applied for the SS card would be enough for them to even talk to us about why OUR money is in THEIR bank. I did what they ask so we will sit it out and see what else they come up with to keep our money. Sick to my stomach because my property taxes have to be paid by this Friday. I will never use them again. I might have to get a lawyer over me having all right information except I rounded the number off. My question is why was it sitting in their bank? They said wait 48 hours after I face my information in to call back to even talk about it. H&R block will get my business next year!
I received an email from Turbotax stating that for the first time Turbotax was absolutely free. 0 to file federal, 0 to file state, 0 to e-file. No hidden cost. I started my federal taxes, and before I had completed my income part, I received a message from Turbotax that to continue my taxes I had to purchase the deluxe Turbotax at $39.95. I deleted all of my information, and tried to contact them. No answer on customer service, and my email could not be sent.
I recently bought TurboTax Home and Business. I have been using it for about eight years. This time, the software would not load from my DVD. All I need is an internet download. I have called for support more than six times. Normal wait times are 90 min, the last time being more than 120 min. They call back, but ring only once, and even if you pick on the first ring, they hang up. You must get in the queue for another cycle. As I write, I am in another 120-min cycle, I presume. I don't want anyone at TurboTax burned at the stake. I would just like them to attempt to meet their obligation of support. I understand that this is a busy time, but certainly they could pre-diagnose and send easy problems to one line and hard problems to another.
Filed my 2014 tax in February and got an e-mail stating that both Federal and State was rejected by IRS. TT said to fix the problem the resend - I did Three times. Three time I got the same e-mail saying it was rejected. Got in contact with TT. They tell me that my SS# was used in January. I said I didn't file in January so because of a glitch I'm having to send off my taxes and file a identity thief with IRS because of something TT mistaken send off.
TurboxTax charged me three months ago for TurboTax Deluxe (which I have been using for 8 years). When I started doing my taxes I soon discovered that they wanted an extra $30 (with no advance notice) to access forms I had access before. I had to pay an extra $30 not to lose the work of my last 4 hours. I am angry as I was trapped. This is truly a deceptive practice. I had a gun against my head. Pay $30 or you lose your return!
If I could give turbo tax -5 stars I would. I filed my taxes and they forgot to process them to me in a check. Still waiting after 5 days. It was supposed to be in the mail, well it wasn't. The customer service guy was a punk, told me it was rejected cause my prepaid card. I asked to talk to supervisor, he said call back in a hr.
In filling out my tax returns for 2014 TurboTax includes options for states that do not have state taxes. The ploy that they use is "You may be eligible for more money that belongs to you. We just need a few things to find out if you're eligible for benefits from the government." I am from Florida, a state that does not have state taxes, however TurboTax has a bogus "search" for state tax returns that cannot exist to begin with. After they conclude that there are no refund for state taxes, they charge $34.99 for an absurd inquiry. For what should have been a free service as advertised, I was charged $71.98 to file my taxes after completing the lengthy questionnaire. According to my observations of complaints, TurboTax Intuit has become a predator that abuses their database of customers by upgrading them to paid plans that offer them no advantages. It is done in a very manipulative way and should be banned. I am requesting a refund and will not be using their service in the future.
I decided to use TurboTax this year because they sent me an email saying that THIS year they were allowing you to file federal and state returns for 0 dollars. So I go to the website fill in all my info and find out that I could PAY $88 in additional tax or use itemized deductions and get an approx $1300 refund. To itemize deductions you have to upgrade and this will cost an additional $34.99. Well, obviously I had no choice but to upgrade. So I upgraded only to find out that somehow I now had to pay additional money to file my state return $29.99 even though I OWED money. I decide at this point to cancel the entire filing. The website had the nerve to tell me that I couldn't cancel because I had already paid. When I checked my email I had an invoice from TurboTax saying that I had paid $0. How's that for deceptive. So I continue with the process because I basically have no other options. After filing both state and federal returns I elect to have them deduct the money from my refund. To add insult to injury, at the very last step they tell me I have to pay an additional $34.99. I have no idea why, but now my total bill for e-filing is over $106. I have used H&R Block in the past and other websites, usually the cheapest I could find, but I have NEVER been treated like this by a company. I will NEVER use them again and I just wanted to warn others so they don't get caught in the same unending cycle of deception. This company is completely OUTRAGEOUS. I have called their customer service and complained but they say I can't get any refund because at this point I haven't been charged anything. The only invoice I have shows I have been charged $0 dollars for state and federal. I am now waiting for my returns to be accepted (my federal has been but I'm waiting for my state) to see I will be issued another receipt showing the new charges. The customer representative says to call back after I receive the new receipt and request a refund but I don't have high hopes for a company that is so contemptuous of its customers. BE WARNED!! concerned citizen
I have been using the Deluxe version for well over 20 years now. TurboTax Deluxe is for very simple returns. No Schedule C, D or E. Had a virus on my computer and had to reformat the drive, lost everything and had to re-install all my software. I was not able to re-install any prior year state software and I re-installed 2014 free state for NJ but I had also paid for NY. I had to repay for NY and spent over an hour on the phone to get a refund. I paid for a download of many states over the years and cannot get them replaced. They should go back to sending out a CD after a state is downloaded and put all the forms that were in the Deluxe back in for 2015. I will be checking out H&R Block next year.
I was e-filing with Turbotax for the past three years and this year was hell to pay. I went to e-file and to my surprise someone else had already done file using my credentials. Contact Turbotax and the said do this, do that. Guess they forgot to say they were hacked. Now me being the poor single mother of three can't receive the refund that I well so needed. So it's good bye to Turbotax. Have to put it in The Lord hands now. Cause the bind I'm in is only for his grace and mercy to handle.
After 3 phone calls and being lied to, I see on news that TurboTax is unable to process MN state taxes. They told me twice "forms will be ready tomorrow". 3rd call, had to leave msg again and no call back. Took my money to file. Why not tell me the issue?
For over 20 years I have used TurboTax and for many of those years I have sworn it would be my last. I have found Intuit to be very intrusive and annoying with their marketing. It seems like they always tried to email me offers to purchase their product for more than I could buy it at Costco. Additionally, taxes are something I don't like to think about all year so I do not want them sending me offers and emails all year. I have been aware of free services for several years but did not make the change out of convenience and fear of change. On-the-other-hand, I almost had a heart attack last night after I had spent considerable time doing my taxes and I received a message that the program I was using was no longer capable of doing my very simple tax return. They were charging me 30 dollars more to upgrade to a new version. Certainly they didn't tell me that when I paid my annual 50 dollars for the same product I had always used. Once again they were trying to gouge me. Every year I felt it was a little excessive when they charged me 25-30 dollars extra to download another state's form so I could do my mother's taxes. I thought it a little excessive when I paid around 25 dollars each to file my state return and my mother's. This year's added fee was just too much. In the entire tax year (2014) I only traded one stock, one time. I bought 100 shares at a certain price and I sold 100 shares at a certain price. Not rocket science. I know when I bought it, what price I paid for it, and when I sold it. They seriously want to charge me 30 dollars for that simplistic transaction? The truth is the 30 dollars is not an issue. The issue is that they want me to download and install an entire new program for this one tiny transaction, knowing full well that if I download it I will spend an additional hour or two answering even more stupid, unrelated questions about my financial planning and investing that I have no desire or need to answer. There are years when I have had very complex tax returns and there are years like this year where they are amazingly simple. I have one income, one mortgage, no interest income, very little investment income, and very few deductions. I should be able to do this return on a cocktail napkin, but with Turbo Tax it is a very long arduous task of downloading specific versions and asking a million questions that have nothing to do with me as an individual. And now they want to make it even more detailed and complicated? TaxAct is free, as far as I know, and an article I found on Google ranked it as the second most popular tax program. Articles I read also said H&R Block is offering their program free to anyone who switches from TurboTax. I guess it is time to make the change. I refuse to pay them 30 dollars to complicate my life. They should be paying me for the distress they have already caused me. I hate returning things, but I feel I will be going back to Costco and telling them the program did not work and asking for my money back.
I have been a loyal Intuit Turbo Tax customer for many years. Like many others, I was affected by the poorly communicated software change and had to upgrade to Premier. I accepted the apology and the inconvenience in stride. I am writing for a different reason. I encountered a problem with Turbo Tax shutting down when I went to enter my credit card information to e-file my state return simultaneously with my federal return. After the fourth attempt of reentering my bank information and my 5-digit code and having the software close after telling me it needed to save a copy of my return (which it didn't do), I went online to look for help. I found that someone else had posted the same problem on Turbo Tax AnswerXchange but there was no response so I called customer support. After over 1 hour on the phone with the customer service rep consulting with technical support (case #**), I was directed to a page that showed when certain forms would be available for filing by state and told that one of the forms listed for my state wasn't available for e-filing until February 13. I was told my problem would be resolved if I waited until Feb. 13 to file because of this form. I accepted this answer but then went to my state tax website to research the form. It did not apply to my situation. I then went back into Turbo Tax and e-filed my Federal return. Once my federal return was e-filed, I went back and again attempted to file my state return. This time, the information that was entered to file my federal return was retained in my file and I was able to enter my credit card information and e-file my state return. Both returns were accepted. Clearly my problem is a software glitch that has nothing to do with a specific form. I am not the only person to encounter the problem as noted already. I am disappointed that the technical support response was to give me inaccurate information instead of acknowledging that they didn't have an answer to my problem but that it would be looked into and resolved. I would have delayed filing my state return for over a week had I not decided to try again once I separately filed my federal return. This year, a process that normally takes me a reasonable amount of time after I have all my current year documentation available, took me at least twice as long. More importantly, I expect more from a company that I have trusted for decades for the value and quality of its technology and its tax filing software. I hope that my review will encourage Intuit to identify a fix for this technical glitch so that others can avoid the frustration that I encountered this year.
Have been using TT for quite a few years. Never had an issue until this year. When I tried to install it this year (numerous times), it came up with an "oops message" each time (always after a 3 % install). Supposedly, there were 4 issues. TT "fixed" the first 3 somewhat easily; the 4th is the problem. It reads: Fix .NET Framework 4.0 Issues. When the install program gets to this, it cycles for something like 10 - 20 minutes and then sends me to a website that supposedly can fix my problem. My brother, who is somewhat of a computer geek, came by & tried to "fix" the issue for me, doing EVERYTHING the website said to do (and going to every link it had listed and doing what each link said to do). Net effect: NOTHING!!!! I tried to "fix" the issue myself using the computer' control panel. Ran the "fix" .NET program 3 times. Again, net effect: NOTHING!!! And we have the 4.5.2 version of the .NET program (well above the 4.0 listed by TT). Appears there are a lot of other folks who are having the same problem. One of those having the same problem said he was a programmer. In his question/letter to TT, his contention is that the issue is NOT with his (or everyone else's) computer but with the TT CD. I agree with his conclusion. Time to purchase the H & R Block income tax CD.
I prepared my Federal and NYS taxes and e-filed both. NYS keeps rejecting my state return due to my 414H contributions not transferring over from Federal to the NYS tax form. I spent over 1 hour on the phone to be told I have to print and mail my taxes in. I explained that if I do this, I am sending in incorrectly prepared taxes. They really recommend I send in incorrectly calculated taxes??? Support had NO OTHER solution. So, I said, "I paid for TurboTax to prepare my NYS return but it is incorrect and useless. I want a refund on that portion as there is no fix for this problem." The person, who could barley speak English, gave me a phone number to call to request a refund on the state preparation. Well wouldn't you know...I got transferred around and finally got someone that spoke English but the call was mysteriously disconnected once I started speaking. I am trying to still get someone to help me.
I have always used TurboTax. I really liked it but by time I was done filing my free federal taxes it was going to cost me about 90 dollars. I went with a different software. The federal was free and the state only cost me 13 dollars. It is a shame that it is costing so much through TurboTax now.
If you kidnap someone/hold them hostage/demand money you go to jail. TurboTax is holding my return hostage unless I upgrade to Premier to get the forms I need that are no longer included in deluxe. Then they give a pathetic excuse that they messed up and did not do enough to communicate and are sorry for the anger and frustration they MAY have caused, thinking it will make up for all our inconvenience to fix it. The $25 refund, that you also have to qualify for, does not begin to make up for the time wasted trying to retrieve it. BOY, DO THEY THINK WE'RE STUPID! They knew with the $15 discount that every TT user would purchase only to get caught in a bait and switch. I have used TT for 10 years. I don't like extortion and unscrupulously practices. I am through with TT and have switched to H&R Block. Good riddance TT. May this site be the beginning of running you out of business.
I know people who filed with HR block the same time as me, and already has their refund. Turbo Tax is slow. Won't file with them next year.
Not only did they remove Schedule C but they now charge ~ $40 for the state where they said before state was free. Time to look at H&R block for their program. Turbo Tax is now over $100 to file and H&R Block is ~$45. Better value.
I used TurboTax online to do my federal and state tax returns. The information automatically transfers onto your state form; and then you answer some questions and you are done. It stated that they were ready to be filed--and I clicked send. My state return was rejected because it was missing information--that never transferred properly. When I called to complain they said that sometimes this happens--and I would get a refund since I could no longer efile it due to the rejection. I never received any refund--and I had to print out forms and redo my state taxes.
I filed my previous years tax returns through TurboTax. Logged in to file tax returns for 2014 and was shocked seeing that the 2014 Tax return was already filed and accepted. It was filed on Jan 18 and refund processed on Jan 30th to some other bank account. My full Identity including my family has been stolen. The hacker has received $4,430 to his account. I need an answer to how and why my account was hacked. How am I going to be helped from this situation? I need proper answer. TurboTax stores people full identity details for several years and they can't let that exposed.
HIDDEN FEES!!! Very upset over the charges I paid this year in FEES. TurboTax is a joke. Told me tax fees were covered, but after I got my refund the taxes were taken out along with other hidden fees. I will not be using this tax system again. I'm sure there will be a LAWSUIT in the future. It's just a matter of time before people start seeing they are being blindsided with RIDICULOUS fees. Never again!!!
I filed my 2013 taxes using TurboTax and received a refund of ~$2,000 from the IRS. I filed my 2014 taxes using TurboTax. When I completed my forms, they pulled up this year's potential refund and a summary of previous year's filing through TurboTax. It showed that I owed $13,527 in 2013 even though my return said I was owed a refund of ~$2K and I DID receive a refund of ~$2K. I called TurboTax, spoke to a CPA who looked at my screens (both the 2013 summary and then my 2013 tax return) and agreed something was wrong with the software. I was transferred to another CPA who confirmed the same and then transferred to product support. The product support person didn't realize there was any problem and wanted to transfer me to another CPA. THE PROBLEM WAS THE SOFTWARE WAS SHOWING ME ANOTHER PERSON'S TAX SUMMARY and not any accounting problem. DO NOT USE TURBOTAX OR YOUR TAX INFO. WILL BE VIEWED BY SOME TOTAL STRANGER. I am reporting this to the FTC and every regulatory body available until TurboTax realizes that their software is broken (not their accountants). BTW, I was on the phone on hold for FOUR HOURS to have a product support idiot not realize that I was reporting a software glitch.
I use TurboTax for my clients and always select no when asked about the gift card program. However on one account an $800.00 gift card was ordered and we did not order the card. When attempting to contact TT we were advised there was a 30 min hold or we could receive a call back. I selected the call back and about an hour later my phone rings twice and then when I answer, hangs up. When I call back I am told by the automated system that my incident report had been closed but they would open another and the hold time begins again. What kind of scam is this? As if their fees and bogus upgrades aren't enough now they found a new way to STEAL our money. Off to the BBB I go...
I haven't received my upgrade notification the one that will purportedly rectify your 2014 Turbo Tax Deluxe fiasco - and I'm tired of waiting. I was one of your 20+ year Turbo Tax faithful customers, who you so crassly deceived this year. I'm ready to start preparing my 2014 tax returns, but I'm unable to enter my capital gains (because there's no way to do it this year!!! ), using your Deluxe version of Turbo Tax. My alternative, of course, is a no-brainer -- use my downloaded 2014 H&R Block software, which H&R so generously and wisely provided for FREE to your customers. If I use H&R Block this year, I'm apt to continue with them again next year. So WHERE IS THE FREE TURBO TAX DELUXE 2014 UPGRADE which you have been advertising these past few days -- which will once again include the forms that you so arrogantly eliminated from this year's version? If you're expecting me to provide you my Social Security number in order to acquire the upgrade, there's NO WAY I'm GOING TO DO THAT. If that's the case, I'll simply go with H&R Block. Having said that, its unimaginable and outrageous that Intuit even had the nerve to ask people to do that in order to get the $25 refund. I have to say, the stupidity, arrogance and incompetence of how Intuit caused and then tried to handle this situation - from start to still not finished - is astonishing and speaks volumes about your company. The first thing you should have done was issue an instant apology and then refunds. But, instead, every step of the way, you introduced more problems, further alienating your base. You've caused such ill will towards your company, not to mention the enormous amount of your customers' time that was wasted. PLEASE PROVIDE me with the 2014 DELUXE UPGRADE INSTRUCTIONS and please respond as soon as possible. Intuit makes it enormously difficult for your customers to contact you. I'm not going to try to call and waste more of my time - and it's too difficult to find out where/how to contact you online. Your customer help is a mess.
I've been using TurboTax Deluxe for many, many years. Here's the newest: not only does TurboTax Deluxe for 2014 NOT include Schedules for dividends, stock sales or rental income, BUT THE PROGRAM IMPORTS PRIOR YEAR DATA FROM 2012 INSTEAD OF 2013. Their "help" site says they're making a fix in MID-FEBRUARY! This is the last year I'm using this piece of crap.
As we all know, usually State Refunds are issued well in advance of Federal. On the 30th I submitted taxes through TurboTax...immediately Feds accepted but MD state was pending. This went on until Feb 4th until I called MD state and they said there must be an issue with TurboTax. I then called TurboTax at which time they told me that there is a problem with their software and it should be resolved the WEEK OF Feb. 7th...at which time I will have to resubmit my return. So in reality if I would have waited until they notified me, I would have been waiting approx. 2 weeks since filing and most likely received my federal refund before my state was even submitted. I have since filed my return DIRECTLY through the state of Maryland. TurboTax should have told us this from the beginning. Also I have been trying to submit this question/testimony on their website and ironically they will not allow it to go through. Also when you do a search in their questions, this problem is nowhere to be found - because if everyone knew of this problem then of course who would use their program? BUYER BEWARE OF TURBOTAX.
TurboTax overcharge for fee. First, TT advertise file with TT for free $0 (big red flag). Once I finished my 2014 tax return it displays the different fee, all on the same page. I try to choose the first one $39.99 but doesn't let me. Once I continue, it automatic charges me all three for a total of $116.00. My tax return is $169.00 minus the TT fee of $116.00 that I did not agree or finalize but was still charged. Right away I contacted TT to ask for a fee refund to explain what had happen. There is no phone #, no live person communication, only through email. This is TT reply (There is no way they can refund the 116.97 as you have filed already. Once they are filed, unfortunately there is no way to reverse it.) First time using TT and will be the last time.
Not only do they have the nerve to charge $119.00 plus tax to add a Schedule C form, but they also charged my account 3 times!!! I called customer service to have them reverse the charges and they refused stating that once the first transaction goes through, the other two will automatically be debited back to my account. However, it will take 3-5 business days! So now, my account is $265 less than it should be and I have to contact my bank to have it reversed. I'm sorry, but if I did this to one of my customers, I would do a little more than tell them "sorry" and to call their bank. Waste of time and money, stay away!
I was completing my taxes and I kept going through a loop when TurboTax said "you must buy the Deluxe Version" and I kept saying no. Only when I said "yes" to buying Deluxe (and being charge $34.99) did the program let me complete my taxes. I was charged only because I received an Alaska PFD (1099-MISC). I consider this criminal and discriminatory. I can't find any way to talk to them direct to get a refund for my $34.99. I will never use TurboTax again. I will seek out another program next year - TurboTax is guilty of false advertisement because they say in their ads, "You can file for free." Only if you don't have anything unusual. Perhaps they need the additional money for their fancy TV ads.
I have used Intuit for personal and business for over 30 years but will never use for Taxes return again. Doing my son's taxes he had a 401k payment so TurboTax said I needed to upgrade TurboTax for I believe 34.99 so I did. Then another charge for something and finally another charge for something else. In short I ended up paying 106 and change to file a simple return. I tried to get a copy of the charges so to have and try to figure out these absurd charges but at this time I can't. I could have them done for 50.00 for him but I didn't so I paid big for a 1500-dollar return. Will not make that mistake again. I definitely got turboed. Goodbye TurboTax.
I have been using the TurboTax Basic for almost 10 years. There is nothing different about this year's tax return, however, when I tried to do my taxes this year TurboTax requires me to upgrade to Premier to do the same tax return I did with the basic last year.
I have used TurboTax Deluxe for many years now without any issues. While I am not having the same issues that many others have related here regarding the forms, I have experienced software issues that did not allow me to complete the e-file process when both my state and federal forms were completed. I spent an hour on the phone with support this morning describing the error messages I was getting in the middle of their screen page (the error message was NOT in its own window), and the lady I was speaking with gave me a free download of Home & Business and said replacing the Deluxe version with it, would fix my problem. I did all that and the same error messages appeared in the new software. This evening, I spent more time on the phone with 'support' explaining the problem and the previous attempt at a fix, and the lady said, "I'll have to get you over to 'technical support' to help you with this". Subsequently, I spent over an hour on hold, and was then bumped back over to a regular support person. When I explained the situation to THAT person, he said, “I'll give you a direct number to technical support.” When I called that number, I found out that they had closed for the evening, just prior to me getting bumped back to 'regular support' (after I had just waited on hold for over an hour to talk to them). While all this may seem a bit convoluted with my explanation of it, they ARE a billion dollar software company and SHOULD have excellent customer service to keep folks coming back year after year. Even though I'm not having the same problems others here have related, I've had it with these clowns.
TurboTax loaded my 2013 tax return data and I input all of my 2014 tax information, which showed it was completing 2014 data until you submit the whole tax return and you find you have filed another 2013 tax return to the IRS. When trying to contact customer service, they are too busy and you are told they will return your phone call which is never returned. They took the money and ran leaving me with no way to rectify the problem, which the company claims they provide assistance for 24/7 for any questions or issues. Anyone can make a mistake but I at least expected some assistance after they obviously had a major bug in their software, especially since they graciously took their payment.
The issues with TurboTax, from years past, have raised their ugly heads again. Multiple e-filing rejections because of the PIN and AGI (Adjusted Gross income). Getting a new PIN from the IRS is a headache because of their byzantine phone tree. But the AGI shows incorrect because the software keeps putting in an extraneous decimal point. And it is rejected over and over again leaving no option but to file on paper.
After more than twenty years of using TurboTax Deluxe, this year the money-hungry Intuit is doing a nickel and dime of their customers. Twice during the process I have been told I need to upgrade to other version, which have cost me $40 + tax extra than what Deluxe used to cost me. I am one of the many others that are complaining about this tactic. For sure this year their revenue will go up since we the customers were side-blinded and cheated with a deceptive business approach. I just hope that everyone that got cheated this year remembers next year and shift their business to other service providers. For sure I will do so.
TurboTax Deluxe 2014 sucks. Intuit is forcing people who have been using TurboTax Deluxe to file their tax returns with Schedule D to upgrade to the Premier version for additional $30. This is ridiculous.
These people waited until people were ready to file their taxes, before springing their nasty surprise. In fact they made sure a customer would buy the product early by offering a discount, knowing that once you opened it, it could not be returned. The "fake apology" from their CEO. If they really cared about customers, they would have advised customers in June 2014 of pending changes. Instead, they waited until tax time, figuring people have no choice. They do offer a "free upgrade" but later in February, and this does not work for people with heavy travel schedules. They have eliminated form 2106 from the "deluxe" edition, without notice. Their "announcement" indicated they had eliminated forms C, D, etc., no mention of 2106. Their "Its deductible" program no longer works on the Deluxe version - I was on the phone for over 1 hour with a representative, and they could not figure out how to make it work. All in all, an incredibly dumb move from Intuit. Their CEO should have learned from the experience of Netflix. Try to screw your customers, and a large percentage will never return.
I have been using Turbo Tax for more than 20 years and have always used the Deluxe version. 2014 I purchased Deluxe Deductions & Homeowners and had to upgrade to Premier for my rental properties. Now I have to upgrade to Home & Business because I have a simple Sch C. I don't have to issue W-2's or 1099's, no assets. I spent 1 1/2 hours with customer service to try and get me the H&B upgrade, they couldn't do it or were they willing to send me a disc in the mail. They did (suppose to) credit my $30 fee for Premier. And in the process I lost my free state download. I'll try customer service another day to fix that problem. I am fairly certain that they have lost me as a customer.
I have used turbotax deluxe since 1989 and have been very happy until 2015 when they moved features out of deluxe into premier. It's not the $30 for the upgrade that is so vexing; rather it's their disregard for my time. For some reason I can't seem to upgrade the product using their online system. "The payment session has timed out" is all I get. I can't call since it's the weekend. What happened to this company?
As in past years I purchased Turbo Tax Deluxe, started entering data. When I got to "Investment Income" suddenly a message appeared that (this year) this requires an upgrade to the Premier version and an apology letter from Turbo's General manager. They made a BAD mistake! Why not, this year, just make an online update to include schedule D and warn people for next year? The number of complaints about what they have done makes me wonder if their people have any common sense!
At first I used the Deluxe edition for my simple return, as I have in the past. Then I got to the end and it wanted to charge me an Extra $35 over the cost already paid to hold the fees from my return. I decided not to go that route and go with the free edition instead. It does not let you downgrade, you have to totally delete everything and start all over. After doing that I get to the very end and noticed my return is $500 less than what it was with the paid version. I go through all the entered information making sure I did not leave anything out or forget to check a box. Nope. Is this a way to make you buy their product? If I file using the free edition I get $500 less on my return. Is this bait and switch? I have used turbo tax since 2008.
I have internet connection, have downloaded updates, finished my taxes. Now I can now file online or print submitted forms. There is no week end support. On facebook my friends are having the same problem. I have used turbotax for years, but I will not be buying next year.
Purchased Turbo Tax basic for about $14 this year as I did not have enough deductions for the more expensive version. Been using turbo tax for years, not ever a problem, with the more expensive versions. After completing the form and ready to file it, I got the notice I would have to pay another $40 just to e-file the return. I cancelled the process, threw the cd in the trash and went online to H&R block. Completed their form for free and only had to pay them $14 to e-file my return. Really turbo tax. No where on the turbo tax box say anything about the $14 not including the e-file or anything about another $40 to e-file. I was very shocked to learn I was going to have to pay $40 just to file with them. It cost them a customer of many years as I will not ever purchase or do business with them again. And be sure I shout it from the rooftops to all I know about how crooked and dishonest they are. Hope they go out of business.
Had an issue with the software at Turbotax online when filing. It informed me that a line needed to be blank but it would not delete it when I tried. I called customer support and they took me through the same steps I took, no big deal. Then, they took me through other attempts, the same ones, again and again, even though we tried them. We had a screen share and they asked me to attempt to delete or input in fields that I was unable to, again and again, even though they could see it! After an hour, I requested to speak to another person since it appeared that customer service rep was not familiar with the software. I was placed on hold and then they hung up on me after a few minutes. I have been at Turbotax for 5 years and I will not be returning next year. While on the phone, I had plenty of time to look up other options. H&R Block is cheaper as well for my use.
The marketing department for Turbo Tax must be braindead. Does Turbo Tax have any idea of how angry they are making their customers by forcing them to pay more for no additional benefit from Turbo Tax??? All of the negative publicity will impact their bottom line. Also, this is negatively impacting your own employees who are extremely frustrated and tired of dealing with irate customers.
After receiving an email from Intuit about Turbo Tax, I sent the following. I am wondering if anyone at Intuit cares about their products. In the unlikely event someone reads this, know that your company is failing its customers in more ways than Turbo Tax. This is truly unbelievable. Certainly not sure if anyone reads this, but the GM who sent this email seems to be the fall guy. Intuit has really lost its way. This email is poorly written. Not really clear about what is wrong. Is it that you are taking forms C, D, etc from your basic product?? What lunacy. Those are basic forms. Or what to do about it if you haven’t used it yet. I guess you don’t realize very few people who use these forms will have filed before the end of January. As a Turbo Tax and Quicken user since V.1. (including Quicken Bill Pay) in both cases here’s my recent experience. I found last year’s Turbo Tax to be clumsy and awkward. Something unidentifiable had changed. The process was different. By the end of the form it was hard to determine what had happened. About Quicken. You should Google quicken reviews about crashes. I have had 4 separate calls to Quicken support on the same issue. Ultimately they updated me to 2015 from 2014 (which you forced me to buy although I didn't need a new version). But I still have the same problem. If you truly search the internet you will see it is very common. Intuit is seriously losing their way. Does anyone care? Doesn’t seem so.
After submitting my state tax return through TurboTax, which was after being informed my State Tax return was correct and accurate and my agreement to pay for my state tax return, Turbo Tax decided to inform me that my state tax return could not be submitted because of a limitation they revealed later they had already been aware of. After using an only questionnaire system in asking why my state tax return was rejected, they simply told me because there were too many items under box 12 of my w-2. No further explanation was provided. I went back to TurboTax to print my return, but the only print option available clearly states, "DO NOT FILE, FORM NOT FINAL, DO NOT FILE", despite the site informing me that my State Tax Return was ready to be filed. As I write this, I'm on the phone with a representative who doesn't know what Box 12 of a W-2 is, and she is getting her supervisor. Simply put, my problem is that my State Tax return is clearly not ready. But TurboTax informed me that is was ready and went ahead to e-file a return that could not be e-filed, but then told after I agreed to pay that it could not be e-filed and only provides a printable version that clearly states that the form is not final.
I have used turbotax (and quicken) for over 20 years. Time and time again they extort $$ from their customers and this year's upgrade fee for filing a schedule d (when it was in this version of the software last year and no special notice was made in their sales material of the change) is finally the last straw. I am taking up H&R block and trying their software for free (because they know how easy it will be to steal customers like me who are tired of being screwed by Intuit). I hope it works well because I don't want to ever go back. If you are wondering what they have done in the same vein with Quicken; just look at their reviews. Every couple years they FORCE you to buy the software you already bought (quicken) just to be able to continue to use a feature that is an integral and necessary part of making the program functional (download transactions from financial institutions). I'm looking to get off this product too if anyone has any ideas.
I completed all steps to file my return. I had completed step 1 and 2 and just needed step 3 to e-file. I ran into an issue as it wouldn't let me e-file however, I was already charged 3 times. I called 888-777-3303 and was given another number to call 1800414644 then was asked to be called back. Number 800-446-8848 called me back. A man with an accent spoke. So I told him my concerns. The money was the last of my worries since I can dispute that with my bank. He offered to refund my money and I told him what I really wanted was to cancel the ENTIRE transaction. He then asked for the first 6 digits of my debit card then the last 4. He then spoke with another man about the transactions posted to my account. He then asked for my entire card. I gave it to him and again told him I just wanted to cancel everything on TurboTax. I sat on the phone with him for a total of 51 minutes and got nowhere! He said he would email a program to me to file my taxes for free. Um, hello? You already charged my card a total of $137 for NO SERVICES. I told him why do I want to pay for something when I NEVER got the services I paid for. I told him after the phone call was over I would call my bank which I did. He then asked me for my card billing address and that's when I hung up. I called my bank cancelled my card and disputed all the charges that were done!
WHAT???? For the past 30 years I have been buying turbo tax deluxe to do my taxes. I am a freelancer and do schedule C. Clearly on the box it says it does home business. And with the new one once you enter all information you find out you can't???? You have to buy the business one??? WHAT???? So all we get is a letter from the general manager on the software saying "We messed up" sorry... You guys suck! This should have been on the box as a warning, instead of entering data and getting to the screen of SORRY.
We have used TT for many years, ever since they were founded. Always used the most expensive TT since we owned a business. Retired and moved down to PREMIER, then after 5 years moved down to DELUXE, which included schedule "D". We have not installed TT 2014 yet. We hope schedule D and others are in there like 2013. We applied for the $25.00 rebate but received an email that we do not qualify. NO EXPLANATION! We have no idea why we do not qualify. Trying to find out?? Our time is too precious to spend a lot of time arguing about $25.00.
I've used TT for years now, but I'm noticing this year in order to have the filing fees deducted from the refund, they have their bank open an account on my behalf and receive my refund. They then deduct the filing fee and issue me the refund. In order for that to happen, they charge me an additional $34.99 on top of the filing fee. That seems like a way to tack on fees that don't have to be there.
I blindly bought the TurboTax Deluxe edition as I have for many years. The Deluxe product I purchased advertised that it included 5 free federal e-files. Imagine my shock when I completed my return, which included a Schedule C, and reached a screen telling me that my federal return could not be e-filed because it included tax forms not supported by the current product. The screen went on to tell me that if I upgraded to a more costly version, my return could be e-filed. I declined to upgrade and was even more shocked when, after clicking the continue button, I reached a screen offering to e-file my state return, together with a copy of my federal return with a Schedule C, for a fee. How is it possible that the program will not e-file a federal return with a Schedule C, but will e-file a state return with an attached federal return that includes a Schedule C? If a Schedule C form is included in the software, it is inherently supported and should be capable of e-file. If, for an additional fee, a state return is capable of being e-filed with a federal return containing a Schedule C, then the federal return should be capable of the e-file that was advertised and for which I paid when purchasing the Deluxe version. Next year I'm buying Tax Cut!
I've been a loyal Turbo Tax user for at least 15 years, using either Turbo Tax Basic or Deluxe. My returns include both Schedule C and D. As I do every year in January, I went out and purchased Turbo Tax Deluxe for use in filing my taxes for 2014. I simply picked up the Turbo Tax Deluxe version, assuming it had basically the same features as it had for years and would serve my needs just fine. Much to my dismay and anger, I received an e-mail from Sasan **, General Manager of Intuit Turbo Tax, saying that they "messed up." What an understatement! The company quietly had moved Schedule D to its next higher version, Premier, and Schedule C to yet a higher version, Home & Business. I now have to upgrade two versions higher to Home & Business, and pay a total price double the amount I paid for the Deluxe version! The reason given by ** for making this change, as stated in his e-mail, is absolute, convoluted BS. Totally baseless without merit! The true reason, in my opinion, is nothing but GREED on the part of Intuit to gouge its loyal customers! Their stated reason is not credible and only angers me more. To add insult to injury, they offer a one-time $25, which you have to go through the effort of applying for after completing your taxes. Then will plan on gouging you, without relief, for years to come. The action of the management and board of Intuit to increase profits was underhanded, at the expense of it loyal customer base, and will come back to haunt them. GREED, nothing more!!!!!! This company has lost its integrity and cannot be trusted!
Bought turbotax deluxe @ $ 69.00, got through about half of my return and got message that to complete it would have to upgrade to premier for $ 89.00 MORE dollars! Paid it and finished return. After printing and filing my return, the program disappeared from my computer. It had been installed from disk! WHAT A RIP-OFF..... NEVER AGAIN!! A customer since 2008.
A number of years ago I completed my tax return online through Turbo Tax. I was on a dial up connection, so it took forever - only 1 item or question per page and then waiting for a new page to load. Well I finally got it done! When I tried to print/file my return, I kept getting an error message telling me that I had to upload updates to my version of Turbo Tax before I could continue. After many attempts to circumvent this, I finally relented and uploaded the update. As I went back through the return...which took at least 1.5 hours, I found nothing changed. Well, at least not until I tried to print/file my return. Guess what? THEY UPDATED THE PRICE. I have never been more pissed. I sent them a letter with my guarantee that I would never use their product again. I will use and try anything but another Intuit product. Looks like they hosed some more customers this year with their "mistake."
I was all excited after filling out the information for my taxes. Then turbo says my state was approved. Then I get an email and a text saying that my federal was rejected. There is absolutely no reason to be rejected. So after a long time online I found a number to call. I was on hold for 9 and half minutes. Then this lady gets on the phone and says she can't help because my pin is wrong or my wages didn't match with the IRS. That's complete BS. I ask to speak to her supervisor and then she hangs up on me! Seriously, I had no idea there were so many complaints. Someone needs to do something about this company. What can we do? This company needs to be out of business and make amends with all the people they have insulted with their lack of business ethics!
In the past TurboTax Deluxe was just perfect for us. New tax laws were built in, eliminating many mistakes. They removed the state form even though we could not e-file at least the figures were done. Sad to say they reduced themselves to selling less of a product at a higher price for simple returns. What a lousy marketing scheme. Most states require state filing! Very disappointed in Intuit who always produced a fantastic product. Contacting them requires phone. Being deaf that is not possible.
I have been using TT for many years and feel that I have been shafted by Intuit changing the forms included in the deluxe package. I don't trust them and will switch to another supplier next year. I have read that I can upgrade TT for free to get the forms I need. So far, I need to pay. When will they notify me that I can upgrade?
I have used TT Deluxe since graduating from college in 2001 and in 2013 upgraded to Premier after purchasing a rental property. Here in 2014 I had again purchased TT Premier, but this year Premier doesn't include the full schedule C which is needed to list small business income & expenses (my wife teaches Jazzercise a few nights a week). I was forced into upgrading to the Home & Business version to access the needed forms. A similar stunt was pulled on Deluxe customers and they are now receiving $25 refunds of money extorted from them - how do I get a refund of the $10 upgrade fee I paid?
This bait and switch has several levels of leadership problems. How can the smartest tax advisers in the country (?) not understand what deleting Forms C, D, E, F, from the Deluxe edition would do to their customers. They know exactly what forms each of us uses, they have all the data about our taxes and the use of their software. They know exactly who they have affected. This decision was made months ago- no one thought about the effect on tens of thousands of customers? If you own some mutual funds with dividends you will get caught in this trap. Surely they understood that well in advance. I have already bought TT Deluxe this year before the apology came out. I assume I will need to upgrade, (guess a visit to the website is in order since I bought the CD to upgrade??) pay for the upgrade, then file a receipt. No instructions on that in the apology letter. They already know I used Deluxe last year. They could easily just update the software I have already purchased this year as they routinely do already INSTEAD of making me upgrade to the new version and ask for a refund. The next $ effect is the same. Why the complicated refund system. This will be a "transition year" - bad choice of words for them but for me to other software system next year. There are other products out there that meet my needs that are not nearly as expensive as the Premier edition that I will now have to purchase.
I have used Turbo Tax Deluxe for years and years and have always been able to file Schedule C (for small business activity) and report 1099-B stock activity. This year, you have to upgrade to Home and Business Turbo Tax for an additional $40 for these simple schedules. UNCONSCIONABLE! Intuit just doubled their profit for its Deluxe customers. I will definitely find another product next year.
I have used TurboTax for many years. I have recommended it to many people. I am a tax professional. I bought the Deluxe version, as I have for many years. Only to discover that it is missing many necessary pieces. This bit of flimflam is not expected from a company like TurboTax. It is simply a sneaky method to raise the price. There is too much competition. The $25 rebate is wholly insufficient. I will not deal with a company that uses these underhanded methods. I am done with TurboTax. You have lost a very loyal customer. Goodbye!
Used TT for probably 20 years. This year bought my usual product, Delux, because I have one rental property. Then I get THE EMAIL to inform me that Intuit had arbitrarily changed the product (nothing in their advertising, no highlighted notation on the product). They promise a $25 "rebate" but requires filing by April 20. I will be out of state and won't be filing until August at the earliest. Since I returned the Deluxe edition already purchased and then bought the Premier required, I should be able to qualify for the "rebate" by loading and registering to be compensated for their fraud!! THIS WILL BE LAST YEAR I WILL USE TURBO TAX. What a FUBAR of a company. In case you haven't noticed Intuit, you have competition nipping at your butt.. You should have done better. Your credibility is probably undermined for good. Sorry to see it happen. I've been recommending you for years. Bye...
Tried to file my taxes 5 times before they were accepted. First two times they said it was a glitch that caused issue with W2 not importing correctly. Then it said I was missing the IRS PIN number, but option to enter PIN number was never given. After 4 rejections, the pin option finally showed up and I was able to file.
I purchased TurboTax Deluxe 2014 at my favorite Costco store and proceeded to find out later that I needed to upgrade to the Premier version for an additional $30 plus tax. I have used TurboTax to file my taxes for the past ten years or more. However, I will not use TurboTax next year.
I have used TurboTax for many years as have my family members. This is the first year that TurboTax forgot how to ADD. Three figures entered were added incorrectly and it also inserted another field onto the wrong line which changed my results. These errors also affected my State return and said that I owed the State, which I do not. Yes, they offered me the $25.00 refund because they failed to include the forms C,D,E, which I do not use anyhow. This is the last time I will ever buy TurboTax and I will make sure to tell all my friends about it.
I agree, TT has definitely pulled one over everyone's eyes as well as their pockets. Of course they will do whatever it takes to not only win you over but to get your money again and again. I ran into this issue in 2014 when needing Schedule C for my 2013 return. Before I bought the Deluxe version, everything was saying you need to use Premier & Home. Premier & Home cost $99 while Deluxe was only $49. I am a self-employed stay-at-home retired individual and do not need another $100 bill added to my expenses for something I make very little money doing to begin with. I called and spoke to a CS rep who told me the forms are still there. I bought it, I used it, I filed - no problem. I bought the 2014 version a few weeks ago and just received the email stating I need to upgrade and that I would receive a $25 refund. However, I went and looked and all the necessary forms are still there - phew! From what I see, it's just the User Interface that is no longer supported. I can understand people who need to be taken step by step through the process, but for the money, I'll stick to Deluxe and just use the forms where needed. Once you upgrade, you need to continue paying for the Premier & Home which is at least $50 if not more than the Deluxe version. This is certainly devious tactics by TT. However, until they eliminate the forms from the Deluxe version, I'll say no thank you to the upgrade. I guess the purpose of TT was the "hand holding". Once they do remove the forms needing to file, or should I need the "hand holding" again, then I shall make the switch to one of their better competitors.
I have used Turbo Tax for years. This will be my last year. In order to use Turbo Tax, I have to organize my records in the same manner as I would if I were paying someone to do my tax return for me. My return is simple: one W-2, one very small 1099 and one form K-1 from an S-Corp. This year Turbo Tax offers a variety of software, depending on how "they classify the complexity of your return." The price bumps up from around $40 for an EZ to around $85 for the returns they have now placed in the higher category. The result is that from an EZ filer to complex file can now definitely file their taxes as cheap or nearly as cheap by using a service. Plus, they don't have to do the work. In financial hard times, Turbo Tax is there for "we, the people," sticking it to us with this price increase. This is my final year using their software. Next year I will put my information together and pay someone to prepare my "simple return." Updated on 2/17/2015: I purchased TurboTax Corporations & Partnerships for a whopping $134. I get to the state portion of the tax return only to discover that the state is an additional $50. I pay the $50 and download North Carolina, then spend the time to enter information only to discover that I must wait until TurboTax updates NC to file the return. The forms I needed were on the state's website so I downloaded them so I could complete the return and get it mailed. I call Turbo tax, incident # ** submitted 1/28, and was told no problem, we will refund your $50. They closed the incident number. Today I checked my bank account to discover NO refund had occurred. I spend the time to go to their website to report the issue and get a place in line to be called (new incident number ( ** ). I missed their call (they will only try one time) because I was on the phone. I had kept my phone in my pocket for hours waiting for the call. They call during the one time that I am on a business call. So guess what? I have to start from scratch again because the 2nd incident number ( ** ) is now closed according to their automated recording. The HOURS I have in this is ridiculous. I would have never purchased the state portion of the corporate return had TurboTax had the integrity to tell me that it did not work before I paid them and spent my time entering my info. My taxes were filed to the IRS with TurboTax. My taxes were filed to NC with State provided forms and an ink pen. The way I see it, they owe me a $50 refund plus the time I spent entering info into their state forms (their NC corporate return forms work horribly, by the way) plus all the time I have spent trying to get my money back.
Have you folks lost your minds? This stunt that you pulled this year on omitting schedules in 2014 TurboTax Deluxe that had been included in past years without making it clear to your customers has to be one of the dumbest business decisions that has ever been made. I historically have purchased three copies each year (one for myself and one for each of my children who live in other state) as Christmas presents. I've been using TurboTax since 1988, but no more. I'm sure there are more ethical and transparent suppliers in the market place. UPDATED ON 02/01/2015: I have been using TurboTax for over 20 years, and was very disappointed to find that the 2014 Deluxe version (which I have used in the past) no longer supports the filing of Schedules C, D, and E. The lack of transparency and a timely warning to buyers of this change has certainly undermined my confidence in Intuit as a customer oriented vendor. The management at Intuit, by thinking that they could get by with this type of marketing scam, has obviously lost touch with reality. Entering into this type of ploy in an effort to force customers to upgrading to a more expensive product (and your efforts to rectify the issue), indicates to me that you cannot be trusted to consider your customers for anything more than what you can extract from them by either hook or crook. I will not buy or provide a recommendation in the future to any of my friends that they buy TurboTax or any other Intuit product. I have scrapped my 2014 TurboTax purchase and have switched H R Block Premium. So far, I am very pleased with what I have seen with the Block software. It accurately retrieved the personal and carry-over information from my 2013 TurboTax file without having to re-enter any of the information. While I am still waiting on input information from several financial institutions that will be required to complete and file my return, I have found Block to be as accurate and user friendly as I found TurboTax to be prior to your 2014 screw-up. And the icing on the cake for me is that I was able to purchase the Block software for considerably less than the price tag on your comparable product, and only a few dollars more that your trying to collect on the Deluxe upgrade for Schedules C, D, and E.
Bet you have to pay to file electronically in order to prove you "filed using TurboTax". Since it costs 20 bucks to file electronically in order to get your rebate, I won't be using TurboTax next year. Everyone should know that it's easy to switch to TaxCut software, which will transfer their 2013 TurboTax info to the new software. I've used TurboTax business and deluxe for 22 years, but I've had it. This BS about being overcharged then having to spend $50 worth of time to get a stupid rebate is ridiculous. I really hated how I quit all my information into TurboTax deluxe and only.
This year Turbotax stripped schedule and rental income from its Deluxe version, then puts in Premier version with that features charging $25 more. That is a greedy business move. I have been a loyal Turbotax user for 30 years since 80's and paying long time dues. I feel being manipulated and cheated. I have other choices filing my tax. I am divorcing Turbotax now.
I have been a faithful TuboTax filer for 14 years. In the past I could complete my taxes with the Basic version. This year I find that even the Deluxe version can no longer be used. I am locked out of posting C and E schedules.. or just a single number from my K-1 from my small business where I have to pay an additional $200+ for TurboTax business (Home and Business can not create K-1s for an S-Corp. (It would be cheaper to hire a Tax Accountant). This treatment of customers is uncalled for. Locking out fields just to get more money and then posting some kind of lame apology from the General Manager about why they needed to trick you... for $30 more (oh yes but then they will send a $25 rebate. Mickey Mouse!!) TURBOTAX will get what they deserve (They have lost this customer). Very Frustrated and Irritated with TurboTax. I teach Accounting for Cambridge College and will never again recommend INTUIT products to my students.
I have used Turbo Tax Deluxe for 10+ years, and was getting ready to buy it for this year. Got an email today from the General Manager apologizing for not making it clearer that they had dropped several forms from the Deluxe version, and you would be required to upgrade to the Premier version to get them back. What a crock!! Didn't reduce the price of the software, but took out forms that most everyone using the Deluxe version relied on. Offering a $25 rebate after filing to make up for the "bait & switch" isn't good enough. I've been researching other tax programs, and will be going with H&R Block this year. Way to go, Intuit. You blew it this time.
I have had a problem filing with Turbo tax on the past. First of all they claim free free free and it's not free. I filed my state and federal taxes online on the 23rd just to find out that they had been rejected with some bogus error caused by their software. Secondly, I had to re file and the error may not be fixed until the 29th. So I might have to go through e-file AGAIN! But never again with Turbo tax! Ever!
For the second time last week I have had my Identity compromised. A fraud investigator from one of the major credit companies happen to ask if I use Intuit/TurboTax. Upon investigating Intuit/TurboTax, I was stunned to confirm that Intuit/TurboTax retrieves, uploads and collects all the information subscribers entered into the TurboTax software on their computers - without the subscriber’s knowledge. Cleverly and legally Intuit/TurboTax collects subscriber social security numbers, birth records, health information, children's information, life cycle patterns, employment information, mortgage records, financial records, employment records, travel information, investment records, driving habits, family habits, etc. most of the time subscribers do read the 'End User License Agreement - Section 5 - Your Privacy and Personal Information.' In fact Intuit does retain and distribute all your name, address, social security number, etc., etc. If you apply for the so-called $25. rebate ... they require your social security number, name, date of birth, etc. If Intuit does not keep your 'identifiable information' ... why are they asking for this information in order to "validate your rebate!?"
I have had a very poor experience with TurboTax customer service on multiple occasions over the years. Their customer service representatives, I've learned, are completely clueless, incompetent, and unprofessional. A few years ago, I contacted TurboTax customer service via their online chat, and the representative was very condescending to me. I can't recall the exact conversation as it was years ago, but I couldn't believe how the representative spoke to me! I've only used TurboTax because I'm able to complete my taxes quickly, but this year is proving to be difficult. My return was actually rejected twice so far due to errors, but the emails TurboTax sent to me were incredibly vague in regards to exactly WHAT I needed to correct on my return. I attempted to call their customer service phone number this morning, and the woman I spoke with obviously had no idea what she was doing. Where to even begin? First of all, when I explained my issue, she had no idea what the rejection code meant, or how to fix it. She then told me she was going to fill out a form. I asked her what the form will do exactly, and she wouldn't provide me with a direct answer. I was like, "Is that going to fix anything? Is someone going to call me? What is the form going to do exactly?" and she's like, "We're supposed to submit forms with errors like this. It will be just another moment." She kept placing me on mute, and before she placed me on mute for about the third time, I actually heard her say to another associate "Girl, don't you give me attitude!" Unless, you know, she was directing the comment towards me and didn't realize she hadn't muted her phone. It was the most unprofessional customer service encounter, except for the last one where the chat representative was extremely rude and condescending. I DO NOT recommend TurboTax at all. Next year, I will likely file with H&R Block. I have always had better luck with their customer service agents, though I find their online tax preparation software a bit cumbersome. Still, well worth it instead of having to deal with TurboTax reps who have no idea what they're doing and have NO BUSINESS being in customer service in the first place.
After completing my tax return and sending it in, I was informed that my return was rejected because of a "missing answer" to the insurance question. I distinctly remember answering "yes" I have insurance. But TuboTax failed to mark my form. I corrected the problem after 30 minutes of roundabout clicks and re-filing my return. It has been rejected a 2nd time for the same "unchecked" box. TurboTax can kiss my... Never using them again!
Got the email offering the $25 for misrepresenting their product. Been using deluxe for years. I occasionally write a check to draw funds from a mutual bond fund. It requires Schedule D. It's always been included in the deluxe version, but apparently I'd have to upgrade to do that now. This will be my last year with turbotax! I hope the other software companies take advantage of this opportunity. Their software had a bug two years ago that necessitated me filing an amended return. Customer service was useless. Wouldn't even admit that it screwed up. I've been using TurboTax over 20 years so I think I'm familiar enough to know it messed up.
For many years was a satisfied TT customer, going back to the time when it was called MacInTax. This year, while waiting for the usual rebate coupon at Costco, for the first time I decided read reviews. There I discovered that TT Deluxe was no longer acceptable and I needed Premier. I was glad that I hadn't blindly bought the Deluxe version. Fortunately, after I took Premier home, I decided to read the system requirements before opening the box. I saw that it works with Windows XP and Mac OS 10.7, but not with my Mac OS 10.6. Upgrading to OS 10.7 was unacceptable since I would also have to upgrade several of my applications. So I took it back to Costco, and went online to TaxACT and entered available statement data. Also found useful information in 2013 TT pdf. TaxACT is easy to use and seems to have many of the features of TT.
I received an e-mail from Intuit telling me I could buy TurboTax online and save money compared to buying the CD version at a Costco or Walmart. So I signed up, paid $61 for the smallest possible return, and then when I tried to do two other returns for my kid's investment income it came up with a message "Sorry, that requires the CD version and you'll have to pay again." This is the second time TurboTax has cheated me. The last time they charged me $20 to e-file for a state, but it came with a coupon that had to be filled out and mailed it, and I never got my $20 refunded. I kept a copy of it and sent several reminders asking what happened, and never even got a response. I will NEVER use TurboTax again.
I have used TurboTax Deluxe for many many years and just received my 'I Am Sorry' letter from the CEO explaining their screw up... I am appalled and angry that I have to pay an additional $30 to upgrade the product I have always used -- I have no choice THIS year but I can assure you I will switch from TurboTax next year for the scam they pulled. Packaging should have stated “This does not include Schedules C, D, E...” on the front of the packaging for us to buy into the change. THEN, on top of knowing they screwed up -- they won't automatically upgrade it 'without' charging $30 AND having US to file for a rebate of $25... What a way to treat customers!!! You lost me!!! 2014 taxes is IT!!!
Have used turbo tax for years. Will not use again. I have complained several times with no response. They told me returns were rejected and I needed to correct the double entries importing my W2. I went in and tried to correct and after a week they tell me my returns are still pending. If they would contact me it would be better. I have only gotten the email saying returns were rejected.
As usual, I purchased TurboTax Deluxe this month (January 2014), as I do every year. Come to find out that TurboTax Deluxe 2014 does not have Schedules C and D (and E and F, which I do not need), as it had in previous years. TurboTax's explanation for this change was that it matched their CD and download product offerings with their online product offerings. The change in product "features" was done, obviously, to boost the Intuit bottom line at the expense of their customers. The more customer centric approach would have been to match their online offerings with the CD and download products. The cost to upgrade from the Deluxe version to the Home & Business version (which has Schedules C and D) is $40. Although TurboTax is offering a $25 rebate if I upgrade, I am still spending $15 more than I did last year for the same functionality. Because of TurboTax's behavior, I am switching to H&R Block's tax preparation software.
I have done my 2 S-Corp & personal taxes with Turbo for the past 4 yrs., but I will never use them again even if they are the only company left. I can get local accountant to do my tax cheaper than the $200 I pay for their software. Selling me something that I cannot use and then tell me to purchase another one of their product is a con job well beneath Intuit. They were well aware of the situation and I don't care if it is $5 or $500 - they took me as a sucker for the last time.
I've been using TT Deluxe since 2004 and it's always enabled me to handle investments, self-employment income, rental income, etc. Presumably, that's what made it "Deluxe. " Not any more. Intuit has deceptively retained the descriptor "Deluxe" but now requires a $30-40 upgrade to accomplish what the old version did. Intuit can charge whatever they want for its products, but it's deceptive to use a label that connotes more than it actually delivered in the past. Slimy way to do business. I'm returning my purchase to Costco and will find another avenue.
Minnesota M1W form - entered a "hyphen" in the state ID number. Went through the entire process. Paid the 19.99 for this company to e-mail my state taxes; found out AFTER they took the 19.99 that there was an error. CAN'T FIX the form. I want my money back! Have to mail my forms in through regular post.
I returned my CD copy for a full refund after I realized it didn't have all the forms as in past years, mail to Intuit Inc., attn: returns dept., PO Box 79275, Pleasant Prairie, WI 53158 with a copy of your receipt. They are getting greedy. No good reason to do business with them any longer.
As I had for years, purchased Turbo Tax Deluxe 2014 only to discover half way through completing my return that this version no longer covers transactions of stocks or bonds. Told to upgrade to premier version at a cost of $30 with promise of a $25 refund when return is completed and after going through a separate process to request the refund. Terrible way to treat customers on the verge of having the appearance of a scam. I have used Turbo Tax for years and am very disappointed. Will have to think hard about using it next year.
If I hadn't read the business section of the Orange County Register today I would not have known about the upgrade needed until I had installed the software. This is blatant theft!! I have used the deluxe version for many years and now I find out it is not the same product. I'm a senior citizen on a limited budget and find the cost of the upgrade outrageous. If anyone has an alternative product that they have used successfully please let me know. This is my last year with Intuit.
I have used TurboTax for many years for its ease and convenience but they have sunk to new low. They advertise federal and state filing for $0. I paid $35 for Schedule A since it is only in the deluxe version & $37 for filing state. How is this $0?
I e-filed on 1/16. It took 6 days for Turbotax to tell me there was an error in my filing. The error was on their side. The software did not record my answers properly on health insurance questions. It came back that I needed a certain form which I did not need. I spent an hour with tech support re-filed on the 22nd and now 60+hours later have not heard a thing. Customer service won't help either.
Everything starts out Free. Then they want you to upgrade for $55 to add stock sales, then they want you to pay $30 for the state filing which was supposed to be free. Then to top it all off and you think you are done, allow them to take their stinking sneaky fees from the refund and direct deposit what's left of your refund and they want to charge you an extra $35 to do that! Total all said and done, they want you to pay $120 in FEES! Horrible way to do business dudes!
I was so upset when Turbo Tax would not give me the option to file my free tax return after I completed the whole return!! Not only did they not give me the option, they only allowed me to complete with a deluxe version which totaled $74!! Then said, more charges may apply... Not happy!! Do not use turbo tax!!!!
I thought I had finished my tax and went to e-file but stated that there was an error on the disabled worksheet. They told me the problem but there was no way to correct it. I had 4 different chat people but they were unable to help plus got disconnected from them.
They claim you get 1 free state filing with desktop = not true. I had to pay and then was on a call with a "customer service" associate for >30 minutes to resolve it. The desktop version sucks and often pages would load. I was also on a separate call with customer service for over an hour to resolve. I've used Turbo Tax for 3 years in a row and this year was so bad that I'll never use it again.
I have used Turbotax for 10 years. This year was my last. After getting a rejection notice through TurboTax, I went to their on-line app and went through their 'fix' process, then refiled. That was last Thursday 1/22. My return filed through TurboTax has yet to be accepted by the IRS. After calling TurboTax multiple times and getting either incomplete, inaccurate or rude responses; I gave up on TurboTax. This morning I used H&R Block's on-line application. Just as easy as TurboTax, my refund is the same, and I was able to efile this morning. Within an hour H&R Block notified me that the IRS accepted my return. I confirmed the acceptance on the IRS site. If you are as frustrated as I was with TurboTax, I suggest you use another service!
Bought TurboTax, assumed it was the same product with a higher price. Need to research into switching filing software, bait and switch gets old.
I have been using TurboTax for 30+ years and have been satisfied. However, I am disgusted with the fact that this year they have significantly downgraded the product without lowering the price or without making the downgrade well known. I can no longer use the Deluxe version to do my taxes. How about a national ad campaign by Intuit "TRY TURBOTAX 2014, IT IS LESS SATISFACTORY THAN EVER BEFORE BUT THE SAME PRICE". I will be looking for alternatives.
Intuit failed miserably in advising its loyal customers that they omitted several key forms, making the program in my case useless. After complaining they offered $25 as compensation, but only if you had filed your taxes already. That is the same as if I buy a car and after I realize it had no transmission, the dealership would only compensate after driving the car. I received a mile-long apology describing the reasons, which make absolutely no sense by their TurboTax GM Sasan Goodarzi. If the company, or their staff had any common sense they would at a minimum offer a free upgrade to the software which includes the missing forms. All Intuit and/or Mr. Goodarzi are doing, is adding insult to injury. Thanks God for competition. After using Turbo Tax for probably 20 or so years, I am finally changing to H&R Block. unless. Just wonder how soon Mr. Goodarzi's departure will happen. I would give them zero stars if it were an option.
After many years using TurboTax Deluxe with much satisfaction, I find that the 2014 version has been crippled. When I try to enter a stock sale, it says I must upgrade to the Premier version, which I did for $32.60. The download which I bought wouldn't work because their web site has script errors, so I spent 30 minutes on the phone trying to get it resolved. WHAT A RIPOFF!!!!
I too have been using TurboTax Deluxe for a number of years. Always was able to handle my tax filing situation for a fair price I thought. This year's version of Deluxe is not the same Deluxe as in past years. If I need to use schedules C,D,E, or F, they require me to upgrade to either their Premier or Home & Business editions, at a hefty increase in price. Received an email from intuit saying they're sorry and would like to apologize offering a $25 rebate on an upgrade. Looking at their narratives of the upgrades, I'm not certain which of the upgrades will work for me yet. Not to mention the $25 rebate doesn't make up for the difference in upgrading to a new package. Also, you're required to apply for the rebate after you complete and file this year's return. I sent an email to the company outlining my frustration and need of further information. Waiting to hear what their response will be, if they even provide one at all.
As for many years, I have bought TurboTax Deluxe, only to discover Intuit has removed several schedules relating to investment income--I think in an unethical maneuver to increase its revenue. TurboTax has offered a $25 refund which is pathetic. The key fact is that we have been forced to purchase a SECOND TurboTax for 2014 taxes. First you dupe us, then you screw us. I tried to go to the upgrade tool in TurboTax and pay the difference to get the Premier version, but that doesn't work either since (evidently) I bought from a third party retailer. For me this is such shabby treatment that it becomes a deal killer. Only what to do at this juncture? We are virtually prisoners of Intuit. It is a greedy arrogant company, willing to do anything to make an extra dollar.
The deluxe package use to contain all the forms I needed to file a responsible tax return. They now changed and I am required to pay for the Premium package to enable me to do what I have been doing for 25 years with the deluxe package. They are offering anyone who used the deluxe package last year a $25.00 refund. BIG DEAL. I NOW HAVE TO PAY $80.00 LESS $25.OO (ONE TIME REFUND) = $65.00 DOLLARS FOR SOMETHING I USE TO PAY $45.00 FOR. MAYBE IF MORE PEOPLE MADE A CHANGE TO H&R BLOCK, OR TAX ACT TURBO TAX MIGHT THINK TWICE OF CUSTOMER AND NOT PROFITS. I am making that change this year.
TTBasic imported my itemized deductions from last year and led me through updating them for 2014. Then TTBasic told me that Schedule A was not part of the TTBasic package and that I would have to UPGRADE to TTDeluxe for $40 if I wanted to proceed and file electronically with itemized deductions. Looking more carefully at the packaging, Intuit had changed Basic to address filing 1040A or 1040EZ. All of the rest of the packaging was identical with last year's TTBasic and no mention was made that you can not itemize with 1040A or 1040EZ. I consider this bait and switch.
I used Turbo Tax Personal Pro because I was self-employed. The fee I was quoted was $79.99. They do not immediately disclose that an additional 39.99 fee will be added for the Refund Processing. When I logged into their refund processing site, the new fee was 116, plus the 39.99 and state taxes. Increasing my total fee to over 163. Turbo Tax is cheating people out of their money with these deceptive practices. I have used Turbo Tax for 20 years; however, I will never use them again.
I have been working for them and they are shady and do not inform customers of info. I resigned today because of the shady things going on.
I have used Turbo Tax with great satisfaction since 2007. In that time I have used the Deluxe version to file online with a Schedule C and it has cost me $29.95 to file every year. This year the company is forcing consumers with at least a Schedule C to go to the Home and Office Version (without notification) and charging $50 more for the filing this year for the same return I have filed each year. I called Customer Service and spoke to a supervisor who confirmed that this year anyone with at least a Schedule C is forced to pay $50 more to file over last year and the year before. A true corporate rip-off and this will be my last year with them, when I was so satisfied in years past.
I thought my taxes were complete on 1/10/15 and having not heard anything, logged back in only to find both state and federal were incomplete. I tried to *complete* the health question, but being on social security and medicare... was not sure how to answer the supposed question. The only outcome was if I couldn't *fix* it, I would have to mail the return. I was forced to purchase the premier edition once again this year but still can't get through on the phone and am not getting a return phone call. I will never use this service again... Spent $100 that could have been paid locally with more satisfaction.
I had to upgrade from TurboTax Basic ($19.99) to Premier ($99.99) for an additional $70.00 while halfway through with my 2014 tax return just to do my schedule E, which I've done with TurboTax Basic for many years. I did not know this until I had already purchased Basic and begun the return. And I don't qualify for their "angry customer" $25.00 rebate because it's only for prior 2013 Deluxe users, and not 2013 Basic users! And now I see Intuit is offering Premier today on special for $49.99 (I paid $99.99). Or I can get Premier on Amazon for $53.99. I would have been better off to just lose my $19.99 and start over with a copy of Premier from Amazon. But I clicked their "upgrade" button just so I could continue my return. This has to be illegal, doesn't it?
Been purchasing and using Turbo Tax Deluxe to do my taxes since the mid 1980's. Have always been generally satisfied. Have also been using Quicken to keep track of my finances during this time. Noticed over the years that many of the Quicken upgrades amounted to not much more than what should have been a free upgrade, it soon became obvious that each year they worked to skim more revenue by implying you REALLY need this new version while it did little to justify the additional cost. Now, with the switch and bait Deluxe requiring you to purchase the upgrade to Premier for an additional $40+, I am convinced to change next year. I've purchased the upgrade for 2014 before I realized the scam. Went to the $25 refund site but was refused because I had not filed 2014 taxes yet, even though I have receipts now? I won't have all my tax documents (1099's, etc.) until well into Feb. Oh well, I suppose they figure everything will be forgotten by then. Watch out for INTUIT scams.
I purchased TurboTax at my local Costco as I have for at least the last ten years. When I saw the display in the warehouse I had trouble recognizing the TurboTax version I normally use. Because I didn't have the time to sit down and carefully compare the differences of the versions on sale I attempted to just use the check mark guide on the back of the package to make a decision. That is hard to do in a hurry so I just opted for the Deluxe version that I have bought for since 2009. I still all have the old disks to compare the labeling. Lo and behold I decided to install TurboTax on my PC today (January 21, 2015) and start entering information to get a first read on my tax situation. I got about half way through and TurboTax now wants an additional $30.00 to upgrade from Deluxe to Premier so I can enter some stock sale information. This was one of those classic 'got cha' moments. Now I'm really aggravated. For years I prided myself in sitting down with a pencil, eraser, calculator and two copies of the tax forms-one to do a first draft on in pencil and a second set to carefully enter all the information in ink for the final form to be mailed. I know how much of a challenge it was then to drive to the post office, the library or the closest IRS office to secure all the forms I needed. And then read all the instructions to be sure all entries were correct and I hadn't missed anything. Lastly, a couple of times I had to drive 25 miles downtown to be sure the tax return was postmarked by the due date. I am going to pack up my 2014 TurboTax disk and drive down to my Costco to see how their return policy handles it. Then I will go online to find a better tax return product.
I used Turbotax for 15 years and it was the best. Once some years ago I tried an alternative product and was not satisfied, returned to Turbotax the following year. This is my last year using the product due to the fact the company forces purchase of the Premier edition to report rental property data. Clearly the company is forcing this practice to increase their revenues. My displeasure with this practice is to never purchase it again!!
I am another dissatisfied customer of Intuit's Turbo Tax. I have used the "Deluxe" version for years but they are no longer including a basic Sch D unless you pay double for premium edition. I intend to switch and am disappointed with the way Intuit has handled this. I understand that HR Block has some offer to discount their product if you have been deceived into buying Deluxe TT this year. Does anyone know how to take advantage of this offer?
I "stumbled" across the negative comments about the latest software. I should was glad!!! I confirmed the negative feedback when I went to purchase my tax software. I was a customer of Turbo Tax when it was known as Personal Tax Edge. I purchased HR Block Deluxe for 2014!!! Intuit, you should not have made this change without customers' input!!! I am done with your company!!!
Why can't I do my investments this year on turbo tax 2014? I have for years purchased the deluxe version and now you say go to premier for $40 more and you did not tell me of the change before hand.
I have used the TurboTax Deluxe Edition for 16 years without a problem. It has always been provided with a State Tax segment. Last year, surprise, no state tax-- $19 upgrade. This year, no statement/or warning, I purchased and was faced (after starting my taxes) with a $39 upgrade in order to be able to file taxes with the income from my small (LLC) business. These people are crooks, using deceptive practices to defraud long-time customers! This time, I will pay the upgrade to "Premier" but will NEVER do business with this organization again. We need a class action suit to level this playing field for the consumers! Updated on 1/24/2015: TurboTax responded, and was kind enough to offer a $25 credit to partially defray that up-charge. Of course, next year, there will be no such credit toward the up-charged product, and our basic package cost will have DOUBLED in cost to in just one year. We Americans are like sheep; show a little remorse, offer a token credit/refund and everything will be OKAY. What if you went to drive your newly-purchased car out of the dealership and found that there was no spare tire or rear seat? Poor judgement, or fraud? Maybe a small gift will make up for the oversight! Wrong is wrong! Ba-a-a-a-!
I have used TurboTax for years to do my taxes and have been satisfied in the past. Two years ago I bought a house, and last year was the first year I was able to itemize deductions because of mortgage interest and property tax (my only two deductions). There is no state return for TX, so all I needed to do was Schedule A for those two deductions along with the 1040. Last year I e-filed with TurboTax 1040 with Schedule A and it was free. (I got a $7 refund, because I like to break even.) This year, the only way they will allow me to file the exact same return is to pay $35 to upgrade. And of course, they also won't allow me to view my previous year's returns (which I've been able to do in the past) unless I upgrade to their Deluxe package. No, I'm not going to do this. I would be losing money. I am done with TurboTax, because I find this to be shady at best. I feel like they're just nickel and diming us. I will be e-filing my FREE 1040 with Schedule A and no state return with TaxACT.
After reading about the Deluxe Edition, I decided to return my TurboTax also, but of course I had already broken the seal on the software, which makes it non-returnable. Here is what the guarantee says at https://turbotax.intuit.com: "If you bought or downloaded TurboTax from a retailer: Try TurboTax software. If you're not satisfied, return it to Intuit within 60 days of purchase with your dated receipt for a full refund." I intend to do this, and get a refund if I cannot complete my return with Deluxe.
The 2014 TurboTax Deluxe version eliminated the investment solutions that have a part of the Deluxe versions for years. I have used TurboTax since the 1990's because I have investments but I'm not very knowledgeable about how they should be dealt with at tax time. I liked the Deluxe version because I could have TurboTax automatically call my investment account (Edward Jones) and all the necessary data was downloaded into the tax program. In the 2014 Deluxe version the automatic investment input was eliminated, but there was no change in the name of the product. The only way to get that capability now is to upgrade to the Premier version for about twice the cost. I believe I have been deceived, and this is unacceptable. I now see that I'm not the only one that has this problem. It appears there are thousands, who have been customers for years, that are upset with this deception and are leaving TurboTax. I will also leave TurboTax unless the company immediately issues an update download to existing owners that re-installs those items that were eliminated. I believe that over the years, customers had come to trust the company, and now that trust has been broken. If the company hopes to recover from this situation they should issue a public apology and get that update download underway.
I use Turbo Tax Deluxe to prepare my return for 10 years more. I bought it again in a store and installed today. I found I couldn’t use it to enter some income now that I could before. The software asks me pay another $30 to upgrade, otherwise I can't finish my return. If I pay the $30, my total payment is over Premier retail price! This charge is unreasonable and unfair - no any notice in advance.
After years of using Turbo Tax we were forced to do their stupid upgrade due to the form changes. Apparently they also failed to let customers know that the forms I needed are not updated and can't be until the 22nd. I went through the whole return even payment and still was never informed. I found out from a friend about this issue. I called and asked for a refund and had to argue with them for an hour then they told me I had to wait for my refund until Tuesday!!! Done. I will find someone else.
I have used TurboTax for over 20 years but never again after 2014. They have deceived the customers by essentially renaming Deluxe to Premier and forcing a $30 upgrade. This is a plain and simple rip off of the customer which likely will not be noticed until Deluxe is installed and activated thus voiding it being able to be returned. I HAD to pay the $30 upgrade fee THIS year but be assured Intuit, you have lost me (and I assume many others) as a future customer because of your deceptive practices. After 20+ years, I am gone!
I have been a TurboTax Deluxe user for almost 20 years. This year, because I need to file Schedule D, I was forced to get the Premier version, at an additional $26 cost over the Deluxe version. It may be time to look at alternative tax software products.
I have been using Turbo Tax for more years than I can count - I purchased the Deluxe version recently and assumed that it included everything that it always had in the past. What a joke! I feel that the consumer has been taken advantage of. Goodbye TT and goodbye Intuit ...
TurboTax removed the capability for one to file Schedules D and E in the TurboTax Deluxe 2014. By not informing the consumer of downgrading TurboTax Deluxe 14, Intuit has committed a fraud of deception. This capability exists in TurboTax Deluxe of prior years. The hidden requirement for forced upgrade warrants the attention of state attorney generals and/or a class action suit! Intuit is free to charge what it wants for its software but it is not free to deceive the consumers.
Wrote previously on this board, my disappointment with the elimination of certain schedules from the "Deluxe" edition that I've used the last 10 tears. Called customer service # at (800) 445-1875 and expressed to the Rep. my overall displeasure with Intuit with the way the change was communicated and handled. She took my info. and after a few updates (couldn't tell what the updates contained) lo and behold today I examined my tax data and Capital Gains forms/schedule "D" and schedule/form 8660 are operational. I thank Intuit for resolving this issue with a little persuasion. Will be more aware next year.
I did my income tax using TurboTax Deluxe with the understanding that my Ohio State Program was free. When I got to the Ohio portion of my taxes, I was told it was free and to click to download, which I did. When I completed my Ohio return and pressed, "Done" a pop-up appeared stating that I would have to pay $19.99 to complete the electronic filing. Obviously, not being too smart, I assumed that it was the state of Ohio, which required this money. Looking at my bank statement, I see it was Intuit that got the money. So the State Tax Program was not free as advertised. I can get H&R Block to do my taxes for the amount of money I spent for TurboTax Deluxe and the $19.99. No more TurboTax. I am not certain that I will report them to the Ohio State Attorney.
I used to have a LLC business years ago and paid a CPA ($1200 a year) and when my business relocated and still being charged a min. of $650 per year. In 2014 and 2015 I used PREMIER VERSION. I buy it online for $60 and have it go to my bank account. I know many consumers are NOT happy with Deluxe no longer have the features but where can you go and file a federal return for $60 (I lived in a state with NO state income taxes) and file my own rental income on schedule E. I DO NOT WORK FOR INTUIT. I went to HR Block and was charged over $225 for 3 additional forms. I am writing to tell you if you keep good receipts and good books yourself and do the calculations BEFORE you get onto Intuit it does work. Last year took less than 1 hour and this year about the same. It is also great to print it out in seconds and last year I got my refund in 7 days. Thanks Intuit.
I have been using Turbo Tax Delux for the past 15 years with no major complaints or problems. That stopped this year when the forms that were always there (Schedules C, D & E) were now gone and I am directed to purchase another version, at a higher cost, to complete my taxes. This is my very LAST year with Turbo Tax!!! (If there was a score of ZERO I would have given it to them. There is NO excuse for doing what they did).
So the TurboTax website says you can file your federal AND state taxes for free through their website. I entered all of my info in, and then tells me that since I am entering info in the Roth IRA contributions, I would need to pay 34.99. A bit annoyed, I figured I would just pay the fee because I really didn't feel like having to re-enter all my info into another program (I'm sure they make a TON of money from this). Then after I entered my state info, they wanted to charge me close to 80 dollars! I thought the state was supposed to be free? So my bill went from what was supposed to be FREE to almost 80 DOLLARS. All for entering a line in the Roth IRA section? What a ripoff and a bunch of crooks! Thanks for wasting my time, TurboTax! The LAST time I ever attempt to use them!
I bought the $39.99 package at Staples, which allows over 8 returns. I did 3 returns, mine after getting confirmation that it's not filed. I thought everything was good until a week before Christmas got notice from CRA that never filed then tried to resubmit but had to pay another $40 even though I have validation number and everything was paid for originally. A REAL MONEY GRAB!!! Use other software if you can.
I had to upgrade for $30! I was NOT aware of this and I can see from other reviewers that I am NOT alone in this! Wow. This really sucks. In the future, TurboTax should never advertise "$0" because this is DEFINITELY not the case! Next time, I will just file through the IRS website!
We used to use Turbo Tax 4 years ago. About a couple of days ago we noticed that there is a $99 charge in our bank account debit card from them... upon further investigating we found that they have been charging our bank account $99 for the past 4 years even though we stopped using their services. We talked to the customer service and with great deal of convincing and explanation and evidence they agreed to refund the money. But few days later we noticed that they only refunded for 2013 and 2014 when we called back, after 3 hours being on the phone, transferred to different departments and supervisors. They informed us that they can't go back and refund the 2011 and 2012. Will never do business with them again!
TurboTax software required me to file a form that was not necessary (form 8824 Like-Kind Exchanges). Also, in form 2106 TurboTax did not add the business miles from vehicle 1 and vehicle 2 in calculating the total business miles driven in 2014 - only the miles from vehicle 1. There are errors in TurboTax and their telephone support is useless. Now I have to wait to see what the IRS will do with my return and then file an amended return. I will never use TurboTax again.
I have been using TurboTax Deluxe software for the past 10 years to do my taxes which do include income from stocks. This year when I got to the section on stocks, it told me that I would have to upgrade to the Premier version of their software. I called Intuit and complained and was given the Premier version at no cost for this one year only. I will absolutely not use TurboTax software in future years to do my taxes. H&R Block as well as others has cheaper software that will do my taxes including stocks. Intuit has just lost a long-time customer. Hopefully other people will take my advice and switch like I will.
I have used the Turbo Tax Product for many years. Every year the product gets more complex and less consumer friendly. Last year the Estimated taxes did not get load until very late in the tax season. This year Turbo Tax Deluxe is no longer Deluxe. I bought the product expecting it to be the same as last year only to find out that it will no longer do what Turbo Tax Deluxe would do last year. I believe that is a bait and switch tactic that is unacceptable in commercial operations. In addition, our Government should do something for the tax payer and create a government version that would eliminate the Intuit product.
I have used Turbo Tax since 1992 when it's known as MacInTax by Chip Soft, and the Deluxe version since 1995. I have grown to love, and more importantly, trust this software when doing my taxes. Imagine my surprise when entering data this year in Deluxe, about an hour into the process, to get a message I needed to upgrade (a $30 price) to continue with data I have entered on Deluxe for years. This change, without proper communication or at least minimally changing the name of the product to avoid confusion is a classic bait and switch. Intuit has lost my confidence and trust with such a practice. I don't mind paying for value in a product, but the methods they are choosing to use should get someone fired. What will be changed without communication for next year in order to gain more income? Without TRUST I will definitely go to another company and build my future with them.
I've used TurboTax since 2006, since as a soldier I always got a discount or a code to file my returns free. This year when I need to access my old returns I'm greeted with a screen saying I need to pay them 30.00 to retrieve my returns from them, or I can file and request them from the IRS. I could also do my taxes with someone else, but I chose to use this company because it was easy to use, and easy to retrieve and review my returns! You used to be user, and soldier friendly. WTF Intuit??!! As I can see all the other angry customer complaints here it appears as though you've pissed off the entire user base, and you've lost yet ANOTHER customer. This year you've FORCED me to pay you to get my tax returns digitally back, but next year I hope you see the amount of people you've burned will not use this software again.
I have used Turbo Tax Deluxe for years & years and it has always handled the various schedules (C, D, etc.) with no problem. Bought the Deluxe again for 2014 (Federal and STATE). Imagine my surprise and anger when I got to the investment portion and found I had to upgrade to Premier (and pay and additional $30) to finish. To add to insult to injury, once I finished my federal return, I found that I could not do a state return without paying an additional $39.99! What?? Are you ** kidding me? 1st I pay for the Deluxe, then I have to pay another $30 to handle my investments and NOW THEY WANT ANOTHER $39.99??? JUST TO COMPLETE MY STATE RETURN??? This is outrageous. Definitely time to look at other tax software packages.

I've just found out that TT has eliminated Schedules C, D, and E from their deluxe version and want to make you purchase the premier now. I've been using TT for about 20 years - not anymore!
This year TurboTax software requires a $30 upgrade to Premier grade in order to report the sales of stocks or mutual funds. To report business income or maybe some allowances for use of an auto for a business you must upgrade to Home and Business version. In the past TurboTax Deluxe allowed you to fill in the schedules C, D and E (without offering any advice or help) and the program would allow you to e-file using these schedules. This year's version balks and tells you to upgrade when you need to fill in these forms, and will not e-file them without the upgrade.
I have used Turbo Tax Deluxe for many, many years. Imagine my surprise when I found out they had eliminated Schedule C, D, E & F from the Deluxe edition. I can now only get Schedule F in the Home & Business edition which is way too costly for me. I am highly disappointed in Turbo Tax for doing this. I will be switching to H&R Block software this year.
I am FURIOUS at Intuit for their shameless practice of eliminating Schedules C, D, E from their Deluxe version, requiring those of us who have been loyal customers for 20 years or more to pony up an additional $30 to buy the Premier version to do what we have been doing for years. To now pay that addition $30 is a 60 percent increase in price! Message to intuit: you are NOT too big or popular to fail. There are other choices out there. I will be looking for one.
I have been using Turbotax since before it was Turbotax. This year I tried to order a CD of the tax software. Intuit tried to force me to use the on-line version. Having worked in Computer Security since 2000, I know that people are trying to hack into their cloud all the time so I did not want my tax info online. It then tried to get me to download the software. Since I have a slow connection I did not want to do that. Finally, in middle of Dec, I figured how to order the CD. It did not show up so I got on the telephone. After an hour I got the CD ordered. Now, I just got an email that the CD delivery is delayed. Intuit used to be a good company. What happened? Who else makes Mac compatible tax software?
I have used Turbo Tax since 1998. Deluxe is my preferred version as I have a few stock buys and sells through the years and the Form D was really convenient. Just some casual investments here and there. So I walk into Staples for a good deal, and grab up a copy of - I should have been suspicious at this point - Deductions & Homeowners with a real small Deluxe under the title. Hey, I'm looking for deluxe which I've always used. I check out and head home. My mistake. Intuit was counting on a lot of people making this mistake (assumption?) Everything is going as usual until I get to the Investments section and now I find out I have to pay an extra $30 ransom to use Schedule D this year. What the????? Upon closer perusing of the package I find there is one SMALL indication in a streamer at the top that there might be a problem right here in River City. No real indication of what that problem might be as it only says "New - Some features are now only available to these versions of Turbo Tax". It's like Obama Care, we won't know what is in it until we use it. Well, now I find out that my old reliable software is suddenly more interested in making their bottom line look good than keeping their established, dependable clientele. This is really sad Intuit! Just because you folks are sleeping with the IRS you feel you can 'up the ante'? Too big to fail? Sorry Intuit, but there are other games in town and if they don't work out, ya know, I started out with pencil and paper many years ago. I know the IRS still has to print the forms. What a pain for me but you won't get anymore of my money. Sheesh! Imagine what would happen in the IRS if people started going back to filing paper forms. They thought they had their hands full with the Obama Care thing, wait till this happens. Lots more government jobs opening up. Come to think of it, maybe a class action might be in order, hmmmm. Really disillusioned with you Intuit.
Don't buy. The 2014 Deluxe version does not support schedule C form nor some other commonly used forms. One sorry way to treat its customers without prior notification.
I have used Turbotax Deluxe for more than 20 years and was shocked when I went to purchase it at my local office supply store this year (Tax Year 2014). They have eliminated the ability to enter even one or two Capital Gains and Losses items in the Deluxe version of the product which forces people to upgrade to their "Premier" version at a cost of $30.00 more. This is an unconscionable price increase for a very basic feature of this software that has been regularly provided in the past. I am not sure what marketing genius decided to implement this change but I know it has made me switch from being a dedicated Turbotax user to switching to H&R Block's tax software. Way to ruin solid customer relationships Intuit - I won't be back.
On Vanguard's web site I clicked TurboTax with the intention of buying the Premier product. Naively, I thought all I would have to do would be to enter the name of the product I wanted, some personal information and a credit card number. Instead, I encountered enormous difficulty logging in to the site, was then forced to enter a great quantity of personal information about myself and my wife. This process consumed about an hour of my time. To what purpose I did not understand. It looked as if I was in the process of entering tax information when all I wanted was to purchase the product. I was finally able to talk to a live human being. After about a half hour she signed me up for the product I was seeking to buy. Now I have grave doubts about using the product to file my tax return. If TurboTax creates such a confusing web site, how can I trust it to complete an accurate tax return?
I bought TurboTax Deluxe from a local retailer as I have loyally each year since the 1980s. I brought it home, installed it on the PC and began inputting data through the TurboTax interview process. When I got about half way done, I came to a "screw you" screen which said I needed to pay $30 to get Premier to input my Schedule D info. There was no notice on the outside of the box that there was a downgrade in function of TurboTax Deluxe, only a "screw you" $30 extortion request after I've worked several hours with data input. This is how they treat loyal customers. Unbelievable. So I paid the extorted $30, finished up my return, and then took the Deluxe back to my local retailer for a full refund. Next year, it's H&R Block for me.
Buying Turbotax Basic? Don't expect to have access to forms as of the 2014 tax year. Buying Turbotax Deluxe? Don't Expect to be able to efile your schedule C, E or D. If you want to file by mail then that may be allowed but you will be constantly asked to upgrade every time you switch between forms view and "Easy Step" view and also many times as you progress through the program. I can't file a return which contains a Schedule C with Turbotax for under $100.00. Because it now requires the Home & Business version. It use to be that you paid extra to get the higher versions only if your taxes were complex and you needed guidance in filling out the forms. Now you pay thru the nose for the right to eFile regardless how simple your small business is, no matter how little you made, no matter how little you and your family can afford it! Pretty sad.
I e-filed last year with Turbo Tax and paid like 89 buck to use Turbo Tax. They said I'd get 1,686 on my NY return. A month after I e-filed, the IRS said I only was due $300.00. Having my uncle who is an accountant do my taxes this year.
I have used TurboTax Deluxe (CD version) for years. This year, in order to complete common Schedules C, D, E.., TurboTax requires an upgrade to another product be purchased. This is truly bait and switch, as well as customer gouging. Next year I will use H&R Block.
I downloaded TTAX basic as I have every year for a long time. I began my return but about halfway through the income section I got an UPGRADE notice. I thought this was just an irritating marketing ploy so I attempted to continue through the notice. NO WAY! TTAX said that this version no longer supported schedule "E" and that I would have to upgrade to TTAX Premiere to continue. A $70.00 charge. I immediately call TTAX to complain. They were ready and offered to unlock this feature just this year as a courtesy to a long standing customer. I told them I wanted a refund of the $19.95 I paid for TTAX basic and I would look elsewhere for tax return assistance. They obliged and returned my money. I then downloaded a version of TaxAct that supported my filing requirements including schedule "E". $12.95 and it includes free E-File. TTAX better take notice.
The forced $30 upgrade to 'premiere' is ROTTEN!! That's it: GOODBYE turbotax. (Turbotax 'deluxe' does not include 1040 Schedules C & E. WTF????)
I've been a TurboTax user for years and found it to be quick and easy. I've always used the Deluxe version to file my taxes. But this year I won't be able to file unless I upgrade to TurboTax Premier. Yeah, let's dumb-down TurboTax, and we'll be able to charge more without an apparent price increase by forcing people into more expensive versions. Shame on you, Intuit. Bye-bye, TurboTax. It was fun while it lasted.
I have used TurboTax Deluxe since 1998 and other TurboTax software previous to this and was always very happy with it. I now discover for 2014 tax returns that TurboTax Deluxe no longer will support investment information. To be able to report investment gains/losses I apparently have to use TurboTax Premier. I am disappointed that what cost me $30/$40 in previous years now would cost me $80. A 100% increase in price seems a little steep. I believe I will search around for a different software program that is in the $30-$40 range and abandon TurboTax.
I could not use 2014 TurboTax Basic for $19.95 anymore for Fed Form 1040 and was forced to buy TurboTax Deductions and Homeowners' edition for $59.95. Now I am finding out that I need TurboTax Premier for another $30.00 to handle one rental property and my husband's business, both of which we had in prior years. This is probably the last year I will be using TurboTax.
Bought TurboTax Deluxe 2014 again this year as I have for the last 10+ years. Just loaded it up and started my return and to my disappointment and great displeasure I can't report all my business deductions (schedule C) and my stock sales (schedule D) as I have been able to do the last 10+ years. Deluxe version doesn't support this anymore. Intuit has decided their software is worth another $30 to do this. Now I am stuck with software I can't use unless I pay more. At this point there is no way I will give Intuit a dime more. I'll scrap my new software and switch to HR Block. Intuit has just lost a loyal multi-year customer.
How to destroy 20 years worth of reputation!, January 4, 2015. This review is from: TurboTax Deluxe 2014 Fed + State + Fed Efile Tax Software + Refund Bonus Offer (Software Download). Like many others (check Amazon.com reviews) who have used TT Deluxe &/or Macintax for 20 years, I am disgusted and appalled by Intuit's destruction and castration of TT Deluxe to force us to use unnecessary more expensive versions of Turbo Tax by eliminating Schedules C,D & E & 8949 from TT Deluxe. It's bad enough that they don't include the questions in their question and answer version, but they do not allow us to fill out these forms directly as many of us prefer to do and often do using the IRS.com forms for special cases. I can download TT deluxe for free from Vanguard and have done so and have seen their "Do Not File" entries on the forms we wish to use. I could do my taxes for free using CCH's Tax Wise (as a AARP tax prep volunteer), but the tax history in my previous TT returns for MLPs, Form 8206 and other entries, would take much extra time and effort. The limitation excuse for Schedule C to $100 of expenses is particularly egregious. Most of the additional features for your Home & Business schedule C are totally unnecessary for most small businesses which can use section 179 to eliminate the need for depreciation schedules and fill in the Schedule C income and expense line items themselves. Turbo tax marketing management, shame on you. It's no wonder you have apparently discontinued your customer focused "Inner Circle" program.
I've used TurboTax Basic edition for many years. It used to include the Schedule A form to itemize deductions. Well, not anymore! I have to pay more for the Deluxe version just for this simple form that they used to offer as part of the Basic edition. More nickel and dime-ing us to death... Thanks Intuit. I'll be looking at other tax software packages this year.
Last year I purchased Turbo Tax for 2013 Deluxe for $29.95 at Walmart. This year I purchased Turbo Tax for 2014 Deluxe version for $49.95 at Sam's Club because the price was raised to $59.95 at most other retailers. Well, Turbo tax 2014 now requires an additional $30 upgrade charge for the Premier Version to include a sale of a simple common stock, irregardless of the values. I was forced to sell $200 worth stock when a merger occurred. Simply Turbo tax is sticking me for $79.95 for what I paid $29.95 last year. What a rip off!!!
I've used Turbotax BASIC over 10 years. With 2014 version, to enter W2G's, I must upgrade to Deluxe. If I need Schedule C, must I now upgrade to Premiere? Are they nickel and dimeing us?
Intuit/Turbo Tax IS running a scam on consumers. When you order the product the company puts through two(2) charges they call authorizations. These authorizations actually deduct from your bank account: 12/22/2014 Check Card Purchase - INTUIT *TURBOTAX 800-446-8848, CA $89.99. 12/22/2014 Check Card Purchase - INTUIT *TURBOTAX 800-446-8848, CA $89.99. They tell consumers to give it 3 to 5 days and one of the authorizations will drop off. This company is using consumers' money for 3 to 5 days as investment money, like banks do, which calls the transactions overnight investments into the stock market. THIS IS ILLEGAL...
I have used Turbo Tax for many years with no major problems. I now buy the CD version online for $69 - a $20 savings. I like that I can look at the individual forms if need be. I like that I can go to different forms to enter information as I need or go through it under the products control. I start early so I can get my forms filed as early as possible to get my refund quickly with direct deposit. I use the free online state tax return filing available in Colorado as it is very easy to hand enter the information on the state form created by the software so why pay to have it e-filed. State taxes process quickly. The main issue I have is that I can't do the online version as it can't find my files located on my computer so I have to buy the CD version but since I can buy it through Amazon or possible other places at a discount early in December, it arrives early enough for my needs. The 2014 version does seem to have a bug, at least in the version I have right now. After the initial install, each time I start it up and select "continue an existing form," it says I have finished my taxes and can file them. Now the fix for this is to just go to the top and select "personal information" or any of the other options and it seems to work. Never saw this in earlier versions so I assume it will be fixed as updates always show up and it is early in the season.
I wrote an incorrect review. I forgot that we use a portion of our Tax refunds to buy discounted gift cards for Amazon. Please review and disregard my last review!!!! I feel terrible - My BAD!!
I have used Turbo Tax for years without issue. I filed our 2013 taxes as always we were told we have a refund of $501 coming from PA Dept of Revenue and $4,500 from the IRS. They were e filed without issue. PA Dept of Revenue caught the errors before they sent the refund and our actual refund from them was $99.00. They sent me a letter explaining everything. We heard nothing from the IRS until now, December, 2014 telling us about the errors and that we now owe them $4,970.00 before April! My husband is a permanently disabled Veteran... we do not have $4,970.00 to send the IRS! What the heck is going with Turbo Tax?? I will be contacting them about their errors and the guarantee!
They automatically drafted my account when for the previous 2 years I have been paying online as I downloaded the software. I even went on the website and saw that they had it checked for automatic payment but I got angry at them and told them to change that and I removed it myself. I even discussed with them making sure my information would remain safe because I would not need to download the software until around the end of February. They assured me that I was fine. Then my wife was checking the checking account and we see the money snatched out. No warning, no nothing which according to TurboTax we are always supposed to get an email prior to any financial transactions. When I spoke to the kind, and she was very nice and kind, lady she said the money was going to be replaced. They were sorry, I was a good customer for 10 years. So we waited and then the CD software shows up in the mail. I sent it back and now here we are. I don't need TurboTax, they need me and my wife.
My 2012 taxes federal and state had several errors. You cannot see the form you are filing out to detect errors from your desktop. The federal and state forms went through TT error search with none detected, so TT e-filed them. The returns had to be redone and the amounts of the refunds had nothing to do with the amounts TT said I would get. My returns for 2013 had to be done twice. An IRA deduction was added twice doubling my income. Next, I found my 1099R form for the IRA deduction had an error placing the state tax I paid on the wrong line. It is November 2014 and I still do not have my state refund. By the way the refund does not match what TT said I would get. I plan to find a CPA this year to sit with while the forms are done. It will save a lot of headaches. .
I got email confirmation from TurboTax that my taxes are accepted for Minnesota State Revenue. However when I failed to receive Property Tax refund, State officials told me they did not receive the form and that I have to send it again. They also told that there are many same cases with other people who sent forms, got confirmation but there were never received by the State. Customer service at TurboTax is lousy: they hide their email and you are forced to wait on the phone. The ignorant receptionist could not understand the problem and when I asked for supervisor, he was not available. I intend to file complaint with Better Business Bureau and with Attorney General and suggest to do it for others. These crooks should be punished.
I carefully and HONESTLY submitted my taxes for 2012. I recently received a CP2000 stating I owe almost $7k because the TurboTax program did not correctly use my data. The IRS found that certain boxes I filled in (federal withholding and 1099-DIV) did NOT carry through and now I owe money I don't have. I'm dead. Thanks for nothing, TurboTax. Submitting a claim on their 100% guarantee. Not hopeful.
I was unable to efile because of TurboTax issues. Error codes were FPYMT-071-01 and FPYMT-042-03. I tried to call customer service, but got disconnected from their side. After MUCH scouring of the website, I was finally able to find that this was just an error they've been dealing with for more than 2 weeks!! If this was a known error, this should have been MUCH easier to find. I've tried calling again today, but their convoluted system won't connect me to anyone and the recordings keep saying they're closed, then state the hours to call back, which is now. The primary reason I use TurboTax is to efile and they were unable to deliver on this. Not only that, but the customer service was non-existent. So instead of being able to efile, my husband had to stand in line at the post office after work which made him home too late to see our son before bedtime. I cannot get through to customer service to get this issue resolved. I've been using TurboTax for 12 years, but unless I can get in contact with an actual human and get some sort of fee refund, this will be last year I use them.
All companies have issues that come up that can impact a customer negatively, at some point. It's what action the company chooses that makes the difference. Today, TurboTax exceeded my expectations. Crystal, my new buddy, was the vehicle of awesomeness! Upon submitting my Federal Income Tax Return after preparing, with their software online, it was thrice rejected. I contacted them and was fortunate to have Crystal as my support person. She very patiently worked with me via telephone. The end result, I had to print and mail my return. Now, I requested a portion of a refund for the software which, all total was $179.00, given the federal had a small problem. Crystal put me on hold and when she came back, the entire amount was credited. Now that right there is high end, mint on the hotel pillow, customer satisfaction!!!!
I have used TurboTax for corporations ($109 per year) and Premier Edition for 1040 ($60) and have never had a problem until this year. I tried to print this form (Form 8453-S), sign and scan in as a PDF as instructed by the program. When I attached, my signature and date were blank although when I viewed the file after uploading in TurboTax, the info was there. I also tried as a jpeg file and the same thing happened. Of course, there was no support from TurboTax even though we had through 10/15 to file the return. I will NOT be buying any of these programs in 2014. TT has been falling down in its product quality and has since the beginning of 2013 to correct this flaw and has not. Goodbye to on over rated product! See ya!
Horrible customer service. Clunky system. The one thing it is good at is incessantly asking you for upgrades you don't need. If the system ever gets confused and thinks you are a business (higher Turbo tax fees), good luck convincing it that you are not. Even their CSRs have trouble going back! Amazing that this turbo tax is now lobbying against federal government pre-filling tax forms.
I have used Turbo Tax for years and never particularly had an issue. Probably that was because I always owed money so I had no problems getting refunds. This year I chose to file with the 6-month delay, and when I went to get my ex-wife's social security number from a previous year's return, all of the 5 previous years data was no longer there. I have moved recently and many of my records, including my previous tax returns didn't make the move. No problem, I'll just look it up on the computer. Woops, no data! What kind of professional accounting firm loses their customers data. This used to be saved on my computer, so it's no problem of theirs.
I've used Turbo Tax since 2005 and never noticed an issue until the last two years. I file my renter's rebate along with my state and federal, mail in the necessary papers.... and the past two years have not received my renter's rebate! I'm not 100% sure if this is one of the scams yet, I wasn't aware there were any issues with Turbo Tax until I googled, but I'm definitely looking deeper now to find out where things went wrong!
Yesterday I received a notice from the IRS regarding my 2012 tax return. It states that I owe over $5000 in taxes in wages that I did not claim. The letter shows that I did import the money that I received from my IRA however this number did not transfer down and calculate into my total earned income for the year. Therefore I am now stuck paying over $5000 in back taxes that is due within the next three weeks. TurboTax states that they 100% guarantee accuracy, however they are now claiming that this is not their problem.
I have been using Turbo Tax for about 7 years. For whatever reason, this tax year 2013, the company changed their software and made it work more poorly. I kept having trouble getting the software to accurately reflect what I was trying to record. In this case, the software kept adding back in a dependent (a very basic issue, I might add) even though I was explicitly saying he was not a dependent and tried to delete him. So I thought I had it correct, filed, and it was rejected right away for this 'dependent'. I used TT phone help and we removed the dependent (it took special instructions from her, not simple) and re-filed (which added extra fees). Now, my return was again rejected - this time by IRS - for the same thing. Now it is very difficult to get this corrected. We tried to recover the multiple times we were charged from Turbo Tax with each filing (our refund was eventually reduced by about $500, we watched it disappear onscreen), but they were not responsive. I tried and my husband tried.
I filed my return with TurboTax on 4/14/14. I provided my bank information, routing number and bank account information to have it direct deposited. When I heard or received nothing, I went to the IRS site to see where it was, and they reported it was direct deposited on 5/29/14. I went back to the TurboTax website and found that they placed my money on some debit card, NetSpend. I contacted Netspend twice and they did not know who I was. I contacted TurboTax, they did a conference call with netspend. This was on 6/10/14, and when they heard that NetSpend did not know who I was, they told me they issued a file, gave me the number and told me they would call me back. I never heard from them. I sent a certified, return receipt requested letter to the CEO of TurboTax and that is when Mr. ** contacted me. He told me that it was me who requested my return be placed on a debit card and that I should look for the card. When I asked why I would request then and then be puzzled at where my money was, and why I had to provide my bank information to get a debit card, his response was "good question". Then the emails began. As they went on, I was told that my bank information just reloads each year; seriously, Turbotax does not even verify that you have the same bank or account information - they just reload? Then why did I have to input my information if that is what happens - does the word "reloading" not imply I should have to do nothing? Mr. ** was informed that I did not use TurboTax last year; I used TaxAct so how did my information from TaxAct get to TurboTax. That is when the sarcastic and rude emails began. I received a call from the 3rd party bank - the one I thought I paid to direct deposit the money to my account. This was a fun day today. The calls were initiated by me at 12:45 and they concluded at 2:30. I spoke with 4 people and each gave wrong numbers, wrong information. Then I left a message for the supervisor telling her to just forget it, keep the money, I was done. And she finally called back - quite pleased with herself. Without my consent, she made the decision to send this bank card to my home address...UPS - where I had to sign. Nice, but we are leaving on vacation today for 2 weeks so there will be no one home. The way she acted, one would have thought the customer should be grateful for 3 companies. This 3rd party bank, TurboTax and Netspend to do nothing and then get angry at the customer when the customer is angry. I find this typical of business today. Instead of apologizing, figuring out what went wrong, they expected me to do the leg work to find out how this happened, then correct the mistake and PAY THEM for the trouble. Yes, TurboTax did not refund my money, nor did the 3rd party bank refund my money but they sure were quick to spend what I send them and then blame me for using their product. Thanks. I think never again.
I e-filed my taxes on Feb 6, 2014 to be received on or before February 25, 14. Since then I have 13 calls to the IRS, 4 to Turbo Tax, and 7 to the Bank of Santa Barbara which TurboTax uses. I have gone round and round with everyone, to find out TurboTax's bank has been holding my money, lied to me about where, when, shipping, procedures, you name it. And I'm told by the IRS after them also blowing me off since February, that no one can help me and it's a civil suit. Good luck finding my money. The IRS has lied to me, as well as TurboTax and their bank. TurboTax has claimed from day one that I'm on my own and they will not help me at all. The bank claims they have sent the money back to the IRS; the IRS says not true and it's never left the Bank of Santa Barbara.
I have used TurboTax to prepare my tax returns for 8 years now and my recent experience has made me very UNHAPPY. Their website states they have a 100% accuracy guarantee. What it fails to mention is this does NOT apply to online tax preparation. So they wouldn't help me out at all!!! Everyone uses TurboTax for their online preparation. Now I'm stuck with paying a ridiculous late fee and interest because of their screw up!
I used Turbotax in 2012 to file my taxes. It was determined that I have entered all numbers correctly and there was an error on Turbotax's part on inaccurately computing the taxable amount. When I filed my taxes Turbotax states they have a 100% accuracy guarantee which does not follow with ONLY penalties and interest. I now owe 1515.00 and Turbotax is only willing to pay 55.00. My husband is disabled and on social security. We do not have sufficient income to pay this amount especially in such a short amount of time. This is a major error on Turbotax's part that is creating a hardship for us. Not to mention the stress is not good for my husband's health. I am not able to pay this and will have to wait till next tax season to pay it which will result in additional penalties and interest.
Twice I've been double charged by Intuit (turbotax). First in April, I filed my 2013 tax returns online. After I completed everything, I checked my bank account and noticed I had been charged twice. I called customer care (of course it was an outsourced to another country call center) after getting the run around from people who didn't understand me. I was finally redirected to an operator here in the US, who seemed astonished that I was charged twice. She corrected the error and I was happy. Today I downloaded the turbotax software to file back taxes and I have been charged twice again! Once I can understand the mistake, but twice? Not only that but after searching the internet I noticed I'm not the only victim here. They need to be held accountable for their thefts! Needless to say, I will not be using Intuit or turbotax ever again. They are nothing but crooked thieves!
I received a notice from the IRS that my 2012 1040 was incorrect. In that, I failed to declare income from an IRA and assessing me over $1900.00 in interest and penalties. On April 16, 2014, I filed a claim under the TurboTax Accuracy Guarantee as I had clearly checked the radio button stating I did not rollover the amount received. Per TurboTax instructions, I attached my return's data file and waited for their reply. I received a reply on May 6, 2014 denying my claim stating I had not checked the rollover button and even included a screen shot of my return showing the button not checked. I looked at the return myself in my file and saw the button was checked. I emailed my own screen shot of the return and asked for an explanation. I heard nothing until June 3 when I emailed again asking for status. TurboTax referred me to their screen shot and again denied the claim. I also noticed the screen shot from TurboTax was for the "Home and Business" software version. I used the "Deluxe" version and I also noticed the file names did not match. This was NOT my return. I quickly pointed this out and they again replied the version didn't matter and they change the file names. They are denying a legitimate claim as their software was faulty. This situation is not unique to me and I hope there is a class action suit, somewhere I can join. I have been a loyal TurboTax customer for over 25 years but that ends now.
I was waiting for additional information and yes the tax return was overdue. But, they deleted my almost complete tax return at 12/31/13 for the 12/31/12 tax return. When I started the return, it was past 4/15/13 and the only product available was the online option. I didn't want to use it, but had prior year's data to transfer it seemed like the best option. According to Rafael in the Office of the President, the "Terms of Service" had the warning that your data will be deleted. But, no overt warning was give, no overt warning exists on the site and no reasonable person using their service would expect the data to be deleted a few months after starting the return. To add insult to injury, his attitude was condescending and flat out stated they did their duty by putting it in the small print. He had nothing else to offer, add, or even consider that their customers deserved an overt warning.
"Warnings OAP reported exceeds $6,510.60. Please review entries from your T4A (OAS) slip to ensure they are correct. This is the amount for 2012 not 2013. Based on you income level you may qualify for the GIS." Both income are included for couple returns??? Printing procedures are horrible for coupled returns.
I was told today by Intuit that I am not able to resell the program after I am done with it via eBay. When I buy a program, I OWN it and will do what I want with it. As a result, I will NO LONGER use Turbo Tax or any other Intuit products. Thank god, I can resell my PS4, my video games, my car, my CDs, my DVD, my iphone, my ipad, etc. Where does it end with these large corporations and their tactics? There should be a class action lawsuit formed without delay!
I have been using TurboTax for years. Yes, I have some debt and my return is taken almost every year. I am used to it. Every single year I say, "take the fees from my return," and every single year my return is taken by the IRS. This year I did the same thing as always except instead this year. Turbo tax screws me over, instead of taking it from my return like I requested they sent all of the money to the IRS and then withdrew nearly $200 from my bank account causing my bank account to withdraw and get closed. So yeah, I WILL NEVER EVER EVER USE THEM AGAIN.
I have used TurboTax for about 10 years in the past. I have to say this is the worst version I have ever used. I suspect next year I will purchase an alternate provider of software. I entered my RRSP deduct limit we get on our CRA notice. Even though I did not contribute to RRSP in the tax year. The software is taking the deduct limit and assuming this is an RRSP contribution (watch out for this one). It appears to be locked down, and attempts to change this in the original worksheet even when I enter a zero amount... still indicate I contributed a whopping $188K, which I don't have. My refund would be a whopping $66K. This will certainly trigger an audit, which I don't need! If someone at Turbo is reading this like a programmer, maybe check what I have indicated. Create a new update, and maybe I can get it submitted by tomorrow night. Since we have an abundance of medical expenses/disability amounts which will trigger an audit almost every year. At this point I don't trust its math, as it is failing at a very basic calculation.
I have purchased and used Turbo-Tax since 2005 if not longer... and each year I have used it to prepare my own tax return, my daughter, my sister-in-law, and my niece's returns. Each year the program worked as advertised... However the last two years, because of circumstances, I did not receive the one (1) free state filing as promised and advertised.
I used Turbo Tax to file my federal taxes through the internet. This was to be a free service. I owe $5 and had put on my charge card. I cancelled and had a withdrawal from my checking account. I could not check to see if the charge card was cancelled or if the $5 is coming out of my checking acct. There was an accounting service, a review of state taxes and a $69 fee for this free service. I have had no response from anyone at Turbo Tax. Pls review and advise.
I have a client who needs to amend his 2008 tax form (yes, in 2014). All updates for TurboTax from 2009 forward are available. After 22 minutes on the phone with a rep who did not understand the problem and a supervisor who did, I have to say I am deeply disappointed in the attitude expressed by the supervisor. I was informed that TurboTax does not provide support for tax products older than five (5) years. I made it clear that I did not need any support, all I need is the update file for TurboTax 2008. The supervisor said that providing the file would be providing support. I asked if it would be possible to simply make updates to older products available on a page on their site with a disclaimer that "no product support is available, however, these files are being made available as a courtesy to the customer." I also explained that it might take as much as 15 minutes of a web developer's time to create such a page and link every update file for every old version of TurboTax they have. The supervisor explained that Intuit has "made a business decision to not support customers." Wow. I found that absolutely astonishing. TurboTax ALWAYS has an update. There are SO many errors in the program when it is released, you have to get the updates. Sometimes, such as last year, critical updates come out AFTER April 15 (had to amend my own tax form to pay the additional $10). I have personally used TurboTax, successfully though not easily, for several years. For Intuit to simply make it so customers cannot respond appropriately to the IRS is appallingly bad customer service. Shame on Intuit.
MY TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE WITH TURBOTAX: On April 10 I determined that I was not going to receive a K-1 in time for the April filing. I requested via TurboTax Deluxe an extension for filing. I was sent to another TurboTax site (Easyextension) to file the extension, which I did. I received an email saying my extension was pending. I NEVER received any further communication from Intuit. On April 18, I called Intuit and was told my extension had been rejected because of an incorrect state abbreviation. I asked to have a copy of what was submitted. I have never received any correspondence from Intuit including any forms they have supposedly submitted on my behalf. Nothing, Nada. My only recourse now is to file when I get my documents and absorb any penalties and interest. So much for any TurboTax guarantees.
I selected option to have part of refund placed on an Amazon Gift Card. The email with the activation instructions was either accidentally deleted or it just disappeared. Trying to contact Turbo Tax to get this resolved. They do not publish any phone numbers on their website. Instead, you have to use their online question area to post a question between the hours of 8a-5p Pacific Time for Turbo Tax to give you a phone number to call. I work so this is not an option for me. I've used their online "help" forums only to receive replies that they cannot respond to emails. I've spent 3 days on this and am no further ahead. Turbo Tax requires that consumers pay them before they will process our taxes. When it is the consumer that wants their refund, you can't reach Turbo Tax. If you look at their online posts, it appears many others are experiencing the same problem.
Day 2 after an hour on the phone yesterday. Too many problems to list: listed total car km, then listed work km. It kept saying the work km can't be higher than the total (it wasn't). Went back to play with the numbers and lost ALL data from the page... After 5 tries I finally deleted the commas and it worked (why didn't it tell me that??). Got to where I sold some stock and it wants the buy/sell info from 10 years ago (impossible to get). Phoned financial guy and he says, "You don't need that, as you have that on a t5-008," but it won't let me get beyond this. We DEFINITELY won't be using it next year, and we may even go to a tax guy THIS year and just scrap it from the computer... Not at all happy. This product needs serious work!!!
1st of all I filed my taxes on Feb. 11th, 2014 with TurboTax. Said return was accepted same day. Been 71 days I never received refund. I had efiled. I was told I suppose have my return on or by March 4th, 2014. Today April 21st I called them - often got wild goose chase. I keep telling them I am not happy with them. They told me I am going get refund on their product on 25th March. I haven't even got that either. Their people say they can't do anything, contact IRS. I pay them take care of my taxes. I have do work. I learn hard way. I should have gone to or use H&R Block software. TurboTax is a scam and H&R Block are professionals. I think TurboTax do not want be bothered with customer complaints. I want my tax refund - been 71 days and counting. I called on 15th. TurboTax said my return accepted by IRS; I should receive it any day. So I checked IRS online - state still being processed. With H&R Block I never had this problem.
I was very disappointed with turbo tax. I paid them their part to do my taxes and I got screwed by them taking their dues out of my personal savings account without my knowledge. I thought they would have charged me right then and collected their dues. No, the student loan collected my money and turbo tax did not get their share at the beginning. Why was that? Is that the whole deal of them for doing the business that they do in the first place? I was very upset that my account was short from Turbo Tax taking out of my account. They did approve the money so why did they not get first choice of taking their fees. That is what blows my mind. I just don't get it. It really ticks me off and I will not go through their service again ever. Just make sure you watch who you're dealing with. I also would appreciate a courtesy call before they did this. Plus I called and I was hung up twice. Don't ever want their service again.
I tried to file my return three times because I kept receiving errors that my Federal and two state returns were rejected. I called TurboTax five times and five times I spoke with women who did not know how to spell "tax." I kept receiving emails that stated that I needed to fix my return. However, I went to the IRS website and it stated that my return was being processed. I paid $129 for hours and hours of work. Just ridiculous!
Called the support line for a simple problem using the software. Support person was rude and impatient and told me that my computer was broken, since he could not figure out what I was doing wrong. Turns out I was simply using the wrong view. Anyone with basic knowledge of the program would have quickly figured this out.
After I filed my returns, I rechecked them and TurboTax software did not import my wife's 1099-R to my states return. It cost me about $400 more. I checked last year's return and the same thing happened. Now I have to file an amended return.
Filed my income tax. Pressed send. Got no confirmation #. The government didn't receive it. Tried to reinstall the program and got a corrupt file message. I also had a copy of the return on my computer. Went to open it and the file was empty. I paid $30.00 for this program.
The Franchise Tax Board had to recalculated the tax I owed based on the same taxable income because TurboTax did not calculate it correctly as promised.
This year, I had to report one small transaction on the 1099-B form. When I reached this section, TurboTax informed me that could not report 1099-B information unless I upgraded to the $74.99 "premium" edition. Charging more for complicated returns is common, but this is an outrageous charge for a common form - when filling out the same form is free or half the cost on other services. TurboTax tricks users into thinking they can file for "free" and then if your return is remotely complicated, suddenly you can't file without "upgrading." You've already entered all of your information, you want taxes to be over, so you suck it up and pay. That's what they're counting on. But they have started to charge obscenely high fees for common forms. I'm not a rich person with my own business. I had one small mutual fund transaction. My taxes should not cost $74.99. What a scam. I had to start over on another service.
My account was just hacked and all of my info stolen. They got my user ID, created a fake email address and requested a password reset. I am locked out of my own taxes and they have my social and everything about me to successfully open accounts, hack my bank and anything they want. I have tracked them to a Turkish Air Base. I called Turbo Tax and waited on hold for 45 minutes. Then the lady told me she couldn't do anything. I said, "You need to deactivate access to my account". She said all she could do is reset the password but that would send the password to the people that hacked the account. I said she needed to get a hold of her security department and get this account deactivated. She placed me on hold and Never came back! After 50 minutes I finally gave up. They have NO security process that she could tell me about and they simply DID NOT CARE my social and all of my info was given BY THEM to the wrong person. I will be contacting an attorney to see what I can do against them legally for not taking action!
TurboTax deducts presidential campaign fund without permission. I have filed taxes with TurboTax and had never experienced this. After submitting my taxes, I saw that TurboTax had deducted $3 each from both myself and my husband - I have always been requested whether I would like to contribute to this, and so I never expected it to be charged automatically. This is entirely unethical. I'm posting this information so others would be aware of this issue.
Requires a phone call (and long wait times this time of year) to downgrade from "premier" to "deluxe". No thanks. Export previous year taxes to pdf, then import that to hrblock.com and did my taxes there. What a dumb business strategy for them to complicate a downgrade process. I was with them for 10 years and was happy... now they've lost me for the next 50.
This is probably the worst tax filing experience I have ever had. It is nearly impossible to go back and make changes without starting the whole filing process over. The auto fill from the Federal to State and City is inaccurate and impossible to change without starting over. If you are required to file city taxes, I recommend you find another software. I work inside the city limits and live outside the city and it is possible to change your residency status to living outside the city limits; however, if you have travel mileage expenses and you only work in the city office for only 75% of the time and 25% outside the city limits, the TurboTax software does not allow you to change it. I learned this after I paid! Call the 1800 number, wait time is less than 20 minutes. Wait time for me 53 minutes and no one could assist me. So I just gave the money to my City. Too tired and too much time wasted.
I used TurboTax to submit my federal and state taxes on February 25, 2014 and as of April 13, 2014, I have yet to receive my refunds both federal and state. I went to "where's my refund" link on IRS.GOV and there is NOTHING! Now I'm going to have to call IRS to see what's going on. So much for e-filing early!!!
I NETFILEd my tax return in February 2014. In 2014, I was required to submit a copy of my tax return, as part of the annual rent-geared to income process. When I returned to TurboTax, I got FILE COPY, DO NOT SUBMIT. I could not submit the TurboTax copy. My question is, what are people supposed to do with the FILE COPY? DO NOT SUBMIT tax return? Should I buy a different tax preparation software in 2015?
I tried to submit my 2013 taxes with them but if you have a 1099-MISC, they want to charge you. Fraud and false advertising. IRS need to get them because filing federal is free no matter what.
The process to estimate taxes for the next year is very cumbersome. Why not simply use the same forms, formats and figures from the prior year return with the capability to change where needed and clearly marking each with "estimated for 20XX"? The pages, forms and fields for estimating income and figuring taxes does not come close to matching what was filled out for the return currently being processed.
Have been using Turbo Tax since before it was Turbo Tax... Parsons was the original and Intuit bought it. Absolutely ridiculous that the software will not import from PDF. Looking for another alternative.
I used TurboTax Deluxe 2001 to create a schedule E for a rental property. Deluxe did the schedule E but did not warn me that it wasn't carrying over the excess expenses. This happened during several of the past 14 years. I sold the property last year, and while doing my taxes for last year, I noticed that I had "ZERO" depreciation carry over and "ZERO" expense carry overs. TurboTax did not create the required forms to allow me to deduct the unused depreciation for the cost of improvements, AND TurboTax only deducted $8,716 depreciation over 13 years when it should have been over $52,000. The resulting tax wipes out any gain I made from the sale because the deductions for depreciation that I did NOT get during the past 13 years have to be added back in (recaptured) to show an absurd capital gain. The question is: If TurboTax Deluxe version is allowed to create a Schedule E then why doesn't it also create the appropriate forms so that carryovers can be properly deducted at the time of sale? This error will cost me over $50,000. I've been a "loyal" TurboTax customer for well over 20 years and am very disappointed in the result of that loyalty.
TurboTax 2013 directed me to file an additional return in another state than where I reside. Charged me for it. Completely unnecessary. Also charged me for e-filing my Illinois return Intuit when they (the tax experts?) should have known that Illinois does not accept e-filings that include certain schedules. No way to contact for help or chat except during limited hours, even in tax season, even though they claim 24/7 assistance. Questions are directed to a "community" with no direct response from Intuit unless you devote your time to the long hold times to call them. Big let-down from previous years. Terrible product and even worse customer service!!!!! Last time for me on this product.
Hopefully my experience will be of assistance to others having problems with e-filing their TurboTax filing. Tried several times to e-file both Fed and State taxes at same time after "Check for Updates" and downloading. Then checked all personal info and added extra 4 digits to zip code entries; still no go. Tried e-filing just the Fed tax and no go. Then tried e-filing just the state and it e-filed! Then went back and tried e-filing the Fed again and it went! Try this method it may work for you. Super frustrating!
First time user of Turbo Tax, so I carefully followed instructions. In filing for CA state tax I elected to print the form and mail it in rather than pay the additional $39 to have it sent electronically. Top page of instructions, in the section titled: "What you need to Mail" it clearly states "Do not attach any form(s) W-2." I sent it in without the W-2, but then noticed on the W-2 itself that it states that you must attach it. I called the State Franchise Board and they informed me that the state will process my taxes and that I will get notified by the state requesting that send in my W-2, resulting in a 12 week delay for the refund I am expecting. If I were to go ahead and send separately my W-2 form (which I almost did), I would then experience a potentially five month delay. So Turbo Tax WRONG INSTRUCTIONS can cause a huge delay in getting refunds, and it's very very annoying, since clearly the intent is to get you to pay an additional fee for their electronic service.
Turbo Tax miscalculates Donations. CRA reported that I submitted over 5000 under donations on TT income tax form. When looking at my 2012 Income Tax on TT, there is no such donation. Where did this come from? Makes no sense. I no longer trust TT. Something happened in the transmission between TT and CRA?
I filed my taxes with TurboTax for the first time this year. I was expecting my refund and after 2 months, it was still outstanding. I contacted the IRS and went to verify my bank account information and they told me it was incorrect. They stated that my refund went to an account that belonged to H&R Block!!! I now have to wait a month for a response for an escalation request and then another month for a paper check to be generated and sent. By using TurboTax it has cost me 6 months plus. I will never recommend using TurboTax to anyone.
Got a tax bill from IRS, because I think TurboTax did not submit all of my information electronically. I would like to see what they submitted, but there seems to be no way to ask them or suggest to them to offer this feature. It is hard to give them feedback. Every year I find something that is in error. Unfortunately, this software requires the user to have some knowledge of the tax law or you will end up making mistakes.
Intuit was contacted 3 times for a total "phone" time of over 2.5 hours. 2 "program" experts and a "tax" expert were completely unable to solve an internal data problem with their software. The nice professionals were told repeatedly that the data entry is correct and even after they figured that out themselves they still refused to escalate the issue. The program is calculating a depreciation error and moves it into the wrong column on the schedule E. They even transferred me to an incorrect external number waiting for technical support for their "tax expert". The person answering did not work for TurboTax. What a neat trick...
Nothing happened, no help, just automated service which directed you to answers you weren't asking.. Hung up on (many times) by automated system, no real "Turbo Tax" experts just anyone in their "community" who felt they know taxes and how to fix problems, anyone. Shadow company with sub-contractors with no background checks...
It cost countless hours attempting to find the reason I could not download last year's tax report and save an hour or more typing in all the same entries again. I finally had to type in all the same old labels from last year. In addition, you should hire some better looking folks to represent accountants in the pictures in the program itself. The fat ugly ones do little to increase the value of the program. After using and buying this program for almost 20 years I feel that you should not screw up such a basic as transfer last year's report into this year's forms. Shame on you!!!
I have used TT for about 6 years now but this year, my taxes keep getting rejected by the IRS, supposedly due to "duplicate SSN". Turbo Tax still charged me over $70 for state and federal taxes even though I now have to print a set of extra forms and mail everything in to the IRS instead of having the convenience (I was paying for with Turbo Tax) to have the returns filed electronically. Since Turbo Tax populates a "blanket error message", I trust they realize there is a problem with their program but don't want to take the time to fix it and pass the burden on to their customers all the while raking in the dough. There is also a "glitch" in their program this year where my information regarding a retirement fund is being put into a category relating to an HSA... and no matter what I try to do to fix it, it remains. I will not be using Turbo Tax in the future!
When I go to the 'Deductions and Credits' summary page under the 'Personal' tab there's no place to enter the months our dependent lived with us for the Child Tax Credit. And since the months a dependent lives with you is so relevant to the Child Tax Credit it should be adjustable somehow from that section of the website. The entry for the months a dependent lives with you should not be at the top on the 'Personal Info' page ONLY. For such a small detail that can easily be overlooked and that can have a dramatic effect later on in one's tax preparation with TurboTax software, at the Child Tax Credit section TurboTax should at the very least provide a PRECISE reason why the software computes a family doesn't qualify for such an important credit. This way one will know exactly where to go if there's an error. This will make it easier for customers to maximize their allotted refund - helping families that need the money and preventing the government from having access to excess that will only tempt them to waste more. I'm known for being a very detailed person, but somehow this was nearly the second year in a row we missed out on the Child Tax Credit that we qualify for and need. We qualified for the tax credit last year and it was apparently "overlooked" somehow using TurboTax software. And being as detailed as I am I honestly don't know how I missed it. But apparently I did, and now I have to go back and amend my 2012 return. And what's more we had to borrow money just to pay the government tax money we didn't even really owe last year. Intuit/TurboTax should absolutely fix this, (unless it's run by or manipulated by the government). They guarantee the maximum refund, but I wonder how many new families in America are missing out on this important tax credit because of a minor oversight the software fails to detect.
After filing my WI state return using turbotax online, I printed all pages and all attachments were listed. However, to my surprise I got an letter from WI that not all required documents were attached with my return. When I called turbotax, they said yeah they can't send in the attachments for WI. It would have been nice if I had been told upfront that they were only sending in part of the return. I ended up having to do it myself anyway which wasn't very hard but I still expect that if I pay for a return to be filed that they send in all the paperwork, not just the first couple of pages.
I have been using Turbo Tax for the past 3 yrs and have been mostly satisfied until they start asking for money if you want to print or file your return. If they advertise that you can do it for free then they shouldn't require you to pay. This year a new problem. When I got to the end of the return it told me I couldn't file the return because of an error on form 8891. Form 8891 is foreign income. I don't have any of that and proceeded with customer service answers to correct the problem. Sounds easy enough, go to tools and delete the form, however that form doesn't show and so there is no way to delete it. Unable to file my return without correcting with country I received income from I had to leave Turbo Tax without filing the return and still paid for the state return and couldn't file that either. Very disappointed and out $40. They really should have a live person helping you like they do for banking online.
Turbo Tax 2013 makes an (egregious) error when accounting for prior year state tax refunds, at least for CA refunds: TT changes the "2012 CA state refund" (as imported from 2012 tax return) into a "2013 CA estimated tax and other payments" (CA Long Form 540NR 2013, line 82) on the CA return. This affects the "tax due/refund" on the FED return and other state returns you might file! Situation: I file two state returns (CA-nonresident, HI-resident), as well as FED. I completed FED, CA, and HI and filed CA & FED electronically in early Feb 2014 (I have to file HI manually). I received notice in mid-February from CA that my CA State return had been corrected - my Turbo Tax-calculated 2013 refund was reduced exactly by my 2012 CA refund. Upon investigation (and I mean reviewing every form, number, input, manual calculations, etc.), I found that Turbo Tax applied my 2012 tax refund as a prepayment to my 2013CA tax!! I was stunned to say the least, because this ERROR has quantitative implications for my FED and HI return: they are wrong as well! In the intervening weeks, I have redone my 2013 tax using Turbo Tax many times and can find where the error shows up, but I cannot find the reason - it MUST be in the Turbo Tax algorithms. I now have to file an amended FED return (I have not filed my HI return, yet, so I can fix that manually). I now DO NOT TRUST Turbo Tax to do any calculation correctly. I have to check every little item by hand. Turbo Tax 2013 was not only a waste of my money. It cost me considerably in the time and effort to figure out what it was doing wrong. I'd be interested to hear if Turbo Tax has owned up to this problem!
When I e-Filed my New Mexico State Income Tax return, Turbo Tax Deluxe showed me getting a large refund. When the deposit was made into my checking account today, I found that the state of New Mexico had cut the amount by approximately 50%. Today I received a letter from the State of New Mexico showing their refund and return that had be re-figured. This is the first and last time that I use Turbo Tax Deluxe to do my state refund. I have not had any problems with the federal return (so far). If your state return is furnished free by your state, I would strongly recommend you use it. I did not; now I have lost Faith in Turbo Tax at least at the state level. I am going to use the State filing program to double check everything.
Terrible experience with TurboTax 2013 as it failed to transmit my files for Federal and 2 States. I have used TurboTax for over 5 years on my iMac. All seemed to go well until I tried transmitting my returns electronically. The transmission failed and I received this message: “Validation failed: There is an update available for your program.....” I checked for updates, downloaded updates but continued to get this "transmission didn't go through" message. I contacted TurboTax customer service and spent 1 hour and 38 minutes trying various methods to correct the problem - updating TurboTax software; reloading the software; downloading a version of premier online; restarting my computer; transferring data; etc. Their "expert" was unable to fix the error. TurboTax says they are sending me a full refund.
I had the worst experience with Turbo tax. I filed my taxes on the 25th of March and it was approved so they said my refund would be deposited into my account on the 26th, and if it has not been deposited by the 31st I was instructed to call the bank. Well here it is April 1st and I still have not received it so I called Turbo tax and they were so rude telling me to call a Santa Barber bank and when I did they expressed to me that they are in no way affiliated with Turbo tax. So I call them back and they tell me that they issued me a Netspend card and the funds would be deposited on that card which is a card I did not request. I gave my bank information so it would be deposited there but turbo tax decided to do it the way they saw fit. With that being said when they did send it to that card the card was not activated so they sent it back. This whole experience has been terrible. I would NEVER suggest anyone to Turbo tax. At this point I am furious I worked hard for my money and paid them to do a service that they did not do. So I am still waiting on my refund.
I used TurboTax for years and then switched to TaxCut for a couple of years, and then decided TurboTax was the lesser of evils. The 2013 Turbotax experience was particularly frustrating. First, TurboTax tries to sell a more advanced version at every turn during the preparation process. I finally succumbed and bought the Premiere add-on. This did not solve my many problems with this package. There were so many snafu. We have a royalty each year that I always carry on a Schedule C, which should have been transferred over from last year, but somehow I was sent off into the weeds in the interview process with this royalty creating its own new business and the insistence that I had rental property. (?) Somehow I had triple entries of a business 1099-MISC. I have no idea how it happened, but only caught it during a manual review of the raw 1040 form. There was nebulous help with a commodity index fund in my portfolio that had a K-1 form, and then when I was almost exhausted, the unforgivable endless update bug that almost prevented me from doing the e-submission reared its ugly head. Dig through the hidden files in the Mac OS to find a cryptic preferences file to delete? My bottom line: too bad Intuit treats its customers in such a shoddy way (I also use Quicken Essentials and would switch, but their export features make it impossible to move to another money manager). Here a tip: if you know enough to successfully use this product, you are better off not using the interview option, but rather go directly to the forms and fill them out. Check the final forms VERY carefully!
I have used Turbo Tax for many years, but this year it won't let me file electronically. Just like the previous complaints, it said I had to Update, I did it, and still would not accept the electronic E-file. I purchased Turbo Tax from Office Depot for $60.00. I am asking Intuit for compensation if you expect me to use your Turbo Tax again! Very frustrating and very dissatisfied.
I finished my taxes and when I went to e-file TurboTax said it couldn't file because there was an update available. Fine. I installed the update and e-filed again. Again it failed because it said there was an update available. No matter what I do I can't get the app "up to date." A quick Google search turned up a page on their site with other people having the same problems so this isn't an isolated incident. I uninstalled the app, removed all the preferences and support files in my Library folder, and restarted my Mac several times. I've been working on this for 3 hours now and will probably have to give up and file on paper. Also, minor thing, but it irked me. I owed money to the feds and when TurboTax asked me how I wanted to pay it suggested a direct debit and auto-populated my bank's information from last year. Nice! Then when it asked me how I wanted to receive my refund from the state I selected direct deposit and it DIDN'T auto-populate the same information! I had to go dig out my check book. I'm also going to verify the results for the first time by reviewing the forms it filled out for me. I suspect something is wrong. It calculated that I owed a little money to the feds and then as I put in the deductions that number never changed. I made only slightly more than I did last year yet my tax bill is very different. I suspect something is wrong. Very disappointed this year.
I have been using Turbo Tax for quite a number of years with no problems and no complaints. But the 2013 version will not let me electronically file my taxes for whatever reason. I get a transmission error and the program notice saying if you receive this problem repeatedly to file manually. Which I did receive repeatedly after following the instructions to download the latest updates. Not that manually filing is impossible or hard but it is inconvenient compared to the service that was marketed. I just want to know why you cannot use this system capability. I will consider using another tax program next year (or this year) because of this.
No matter how I set up my printer, the pages won't align properly. It works fine printing everything else. It seems to be just the tax form that won't align properly. Now that I was trying to correct it, I ran out of time to complete it and it won't allow me back to the original work sheets. What I manage to save is a copy that states "File copy, do not submit." So Now I guess I'll make out one manually. This is not right. I should be allowed to work it until it is complete. I have a lot of extra paperwork involving the disability tax credit and I Couldn't find the line 316 to apply it. Now I guess I'll send it in and let someone else figure it out.
My husband is an accountant, yet we always loved TurboTax and used it every year. This year, however, I have now received a letter from the state, saying that my state return is $833 LESS than what we had thought. The reason? It seems when we put that our 2012 state refund was $833, TurboTax entered it as being what we paid in.... so instead of receiving $1903 back this year from state (which I DID think was high, but that is what TurboTax generated), we are receiving $1070. TOTALLY disappointed in TurboTax this year. Last year was so much more user friendly.... We will think twice before using TurboTax next year.
Turbo Tax has really disappointed me this year. We've been using it for many years with no problems. This year, it has had gross errors. We live in one state and work in another, and it keeps mixing up the state date - trying to put it all into one state. It also said our son didn't need to file an 8615 form (minor with non-earned income over $2000) even though it was over $15,000. I would deliberately try to generate the form and it would tell me he didn't need it. When I called Turbo Tax, they just implied that I was missing something and they could not possibly be in error. I'm tempted to pay to have Turbo Tax represent me if I'm audited. Certainly cheaper than going with what is actually "legal". Alas....I'm a "legal" person. I'm thinking of having H&R Block do my taxes next year.
I was charged by turbotax without notice. Did I know they would charge me today? No. Did I sign an agreement that if my tax return took a long time to come back they would charge me? Yes. But did they send me a notice that they were about to charge me, or did they call me to warn me? In case I had bills that would put my account over? No they didn't, they just charged me $100.39 that I didn't expect, and was not ready to come out of my budget. I definitely won't be using them again.
Turbo software was erroneously imposed a tax penalty on my federal return, line 76 and 77. I looked it up on IRS website, found the error. I want to make correction on my 1040, remove the penalty entry, the way Turbo set up. I cannot just remove the entry like a typo, so I contacted Turbo. Turbo agent try to be helpful, but couldn't show me how. So she tried to show me how to download their software (implying that I will know how to fix my prob if I go thru their software). The agent was patient, spend a good hour with me. Turbo did create a case file. This agent wrote a good instruction, on the surface is excellent, and attached the turbo survey feedback to turbo. I spent time to complete the survey then at the end I could not transmit to turbo because of certain error. I tried twice, both was unsuccessful msg to Turbo. I have used Turbo several years. It have been convenient as far as simple correct math, typo form is neat, but seriously tax consequences. Be super careful with them, not just like their advertisement, 100% accuracy, and if you contact their "experts", it's a big waste of your time, Turbo tax experts. Customer service is a FARCE.
TurboTax claims that you got the maximum refund - guaranteed. But if I hadn't found a deduction that I failed to enter, I would have paid $150 rather than getting a $333 refund. The mistake was easy to find when you compared last year's deductions with this year's, but Turbo didn't flag the omission.
After having finally completed the last form, I was so glad to be done. I inadvertently was socked with a $29 fee for processing the refund. There is no recourse. My total cost was $86.97. Next year I will try H&R Block which is free.
I filed my 2014 South Carolina tax return using Turbo Tax. I file a simple 1040 because I have very little deductions. I have used Turbo Tax in the past with no problems until this year. I completed my return and was expecting a refund of $1106. Just received my refund from South Carolina, not for $1106 but of only $432. A difference of $683. According to a representative with the SC Department of Revenue, other tax payers have used Turbo Tax this year there are known errors made because of Turbo Tax.
I tried to use Turbo Tax for the first time and it my last time ever, number is not occurred and after all state file and e-file for each state turns out I spend 160$ which our accounting charge less than that and it's been never problem. After I spend 4 hours on the phone with customer service rep didn't solve a problem with issue I had with tax return. I recommend maybe for some who claim only 1 state but if you live in one and work in the other states Turbo Tax want money for each move.
I noticed errors both on the federal return and state returns. Even though I entered my son's W2s correctly, it did not record his state taxes paid off his W2 and had him owing the state. Then he has joint custody of his son and the IRS rules that whoever gets the year to claim the child also gets to claim the EIC (earned income credit). Even though I went thru the interview questions and answered them correctly,the software told us that we could claim head of household and claim the earned income credit even though he can't claim his child this year. The return got rejected by the IRS saying the other parent claimed the son and the EIC and you can't have 2 parents claiming the EIC when it is from the same child. Turbo Tax said it recomputed the form and was ready to electronically file and when I checked it over, it had not changed a thing! This is the first year Turbo Tax has failed me.
Used this product for the first time this year. Had no problems with our federal form, however, there was an error in transferring information to state form that we were unable to correct using their available resources. I did the taxes myself. It is very difficult to contact anyone as they have hard to find contact info other than what is on their website. I have received no response or help.
My computer used for taxes is fairly secure. It only has Mac Maverick OSX, Turbo Tax, Adobe, and comprehensive virus protection. The first time I installed it the return would not print, system crashed and would only show one user out of three, and upon entering right password the gear would spin and die. Intuit and Apple couldn't fix. So reinstalled everything. Much of antivirus and operating systems from disks before internet connection. Put in Mac OSX Maverick, updated Turbo Tax and Adobe Reader, and had to fill forms out by pen. It didn't crash the system yet the second time. Intuit has very limited Mac printing help on support questions.
I used Turbo Tax to file my Federal taxes online because it said it was free. I gave in on the State tax fee and decided to go ahead since it was already done... There was a choice of paying the fee now or having it deducted from my refund, I chose the easy way and said "from my refund". Little did I realize there was a $29.99 fee for that until I printed out and read the entire agreement. My mistake! I called the number on the agreement and they could do nothing for me. I then went on the Turbo Tax Chat line (since you can't have a number to talk to a real person) and got nowhere! So, I think everyone should be aware of the fee.
I filed my federal and state taxes February 17th. Turbo Tax said and emailed me that the IRS approved My federal on the 18th and my state on the 19th. It's March 11th and I haven't received my taxes in my bank account yet. Turbo Tax said 21 days or less, I'm starting to get really nervous... I paid $96.00 which I think is outrageous first of all, $29.00 for federal, $36.00 for state and $29.00 for deduction fees. WHAT DEDUCTION???? TOTALLY NOT HAPPY!!!
I have used the software for the past three years and so this year was no different, until TurboTax offered a 5% match for any funds put on an amazon.com gift card out of my federal refund. I thought "cool, I buy a lot of books for my Kindle anyway". So I chose to put $100 on a gift card, meaning TurboTax should send me confirmation codes or what not for $105. It never happened. Got my federal refund - $100 less than it should have been - But never received the email that Intuitive says, I should have received within 2 business days of the refund being deposited in my bank account. When I emailed them asking for status, they replied that after their review of the situation it doesn't appear that my tax refund was debited the $100, so I didn't qualify for the promotion. What a scam! I know for a fact that my federal refund was $100 less than it should have been. I emailed them back with a not very nice response that my lawyer and the Better Business Bureau will be in touch. I wish I could email every person in America and warn them not to attempt to take advantage of this "too good to be true" promotion. Intuit/TurboTax just made $100 off me...probably b/c I utilized the free version of software and they had to make money somewhere.
A friend of mine used TurboTax to do his taxes. This friend knows taxes inside and out because he work for the bank in all areas of the bank for over 30 years. He happened to have the opportunity to redo his taxes that year using TaxWise. TaxWise gave him a better return than TurboTax. Another friend who paid $95.00 for TurboTax for his 2012 return and what ever checks the software has he screwed up his taxes royally. He forgot to include his social security on the return for him and his wife and he and his wife are over 65. Shouldn't TurboTax ask where is your social security income? Then he entered his 1099R income as wages on line 7. Why didn't TurboTax question a stupid entry like that?
This product is so fragile that after every update it breaks up...Thrice i have filled up entire stuff but it's not working...specially NJ 1040 Schedules A&B is totally messed up...When you enter some data, it inserts another line and then goes there and keeps on doing that....NJ 1040 Schedules A & B is still having the problem...This problem is there since more than 10 days now and nobody from Turbo tax can fix it. Person who called me from 520-920-2575 called me thrice...Tried everything...gave up and asked me start all over again...which i did it finally...This is the 3rd time - i am doing it all over again...Spent close to more than 22 hours for nothing....
Have used TurboTax for 5 years. This year, they e-filed the correct form to State but when I tried to print, the numbers were all different. They tried to say State had changed their mind to give me a refund, but how many states reach into Turbo Tax and change those numbers???? I straightened it out with State, and kicking Turbo to the curb after 5 years.
In the box 18 I cannot enter $36241.78. It changes to $13,624. Complaints about the same issue are dated even 2 months ago. TurboTax does not care about its product.
I have very happily used turbo tax for 6 years. This year a software error caused my state return to be screwed up giving us a 294$ state return. The state sent me paperwork weeks later saying I owed them 294 before April 15th or they would fine me. After literally 2 hours talking with different departments and being hung up on twice I was told that they wouldn't pay me back or the state because technically it wasn't a penalty, nor could I have back my 71$ because I filed my return therefore didn't qualify for a refund of any sort. After being laid off, having surgery, and with a disabled toddler, it came at a bad time to owe the state 294$ and have customer service acknowledge it being a software issue but not honor their accuracy, or money back guarantee. Also the customer service rep was saying things like "obviously sir you don't understand, I know it was a software issue but were not issuing a refund." Yelled at me, and cut me off when I would try and speak.
I had a question about e-filing/transmitting 1099 forms to IRS. I spent over 2 1/2 hours on the phone with an alleged support person, who frankly appeared to be someone working out of her home with minimal training and a really bad telephone connection. She constantly put me on hold as she emailed her supervisor. She gave erroneous information first, and then said that one cannot e-file 1099 forms with IRS through the Home & Business program, but only by using the web-based filing. And then that I would have to use the online service for the entire filings, even though you can't do my forms online. I still do not have the correct answer and which part of her statements are correct, but I know that I wasted 2 1/2 hours on the phone with a person who had no knowledge of the subject, a bad phone connection, gave contradictory advice, and wasted my time.
I have used the free version in past years. For 2013, I incorrectly answered a question, and was alerted I need to upgrade to the basic version for an additional cost. I subsequently found out that I did not need to use the basic version. Apparently, the only way to downgrade back to the original version is to speak with someone on the phone. After a 30+ minute hold I was disconnected after relaying that I wanted to downgrade to the free version. I think this was deliberate. I am now on hold again 15+ minutes, but will not pay Turbo Tax for a simple return that others are receiving for free. FYI. I have been a Turbo customer (paying every year for for the tax programs) since the late 80s. Unfortunately, may have to switch to another source.
I went to Turbo Tax, just like I do every year, and checked my eligibility for the free product. I qualify. I began my return and was almost finished when I was told I had to upgrade to Premier. I have the exact same situation as last year, but this year TurboTax wants me to pay. I decided to go ahead since I was almost finished. Then I was hit with the charges: $49.99 for the Federal and $36.99 for the State (I am in a free file state). Pretty hefty fees for free. I will be redoing my taxes with another program if my phone call to Turbo Tax isn't satisfactory.
I have used TurboTax for years. I have always had a home business, and I have always purchased the Deluxe software. For my 2013 return, I entered my vehicle on the correct screen, and said I was still using it for business and that there was NO trade-in when I purchased the vehicle. The software keeps reverting back to the YES there was a trade-in. I have deleted the vehicle, re-entered it, same story. I called Customer Service, and after an hour and a half on the phone, I was told I had the wrong software, I should have had Home and Business. I explained I had ALWAYS used Deluxe before, but she told me the programs had changed. She was very nice, and sent me a Free download for Home and Business. And guess what... IT IS STILL DOING THE SAME THING. Definitely the last time I purchase TurboTax.
I used to be a tax preparer for H & R Block....It was a GREAT EXPERIENCE for me. But this year Turbo tax is JUNK....I did my son's 1040, single PT job School, under the minimum....guess what....he had to pay for his 1040. Years past he did not have too. Did my daughter's, her AGI was under 3K.....guess what....she had to pay for her 1040 .....she got her refund but they did not put it thru her bank....She had to pay an additional $$ for having a cashier check made out, AND....it came from a difference bank, which charged her $$ for using their bank???.....She was set up with BMO Harris all these years nothing changed.....go figure....IT'S JUNK.....Now I have to do mine.....I'M NOT USING TURBO TAX-----IT WILL BE SOMEONE DIFFERENT.----I GUARANTEE IT.
They guaranteed a return of $706.00 from the State of WV. I received $6.00 because they put the wrong information twice on the return. Further, they guaranteed a return of $952.00 from Federal and I received $151.01 because Federal said I would get $252.00 but they took $68.00 for filing and $29.99 for banking(?). I have been in four conversations with their people and have been informed that I will not get back the total of $100.99 they deducted from Federal because the guarantee they have does not cover my situation because I did not have to pay any penalties and their GUARANTEE doesn't apply to me. I feel strongly that they should return the entire amount of $100.99 they took for doing me wrong. This was my 5th year with them and never again. Thanks for being here.
Horrible experience with turbo tax this year. It seems like the software got added a lot of information and when called to request help the customer service people are not trained to solve any issues..Waste of my time. Never again. The the second issues is the bunch of specifics asked when filling out a 2106. The software is not requesting enough information to fill out the form then I had to deal with more that 15 errors. So basically was like filling out the form in raw perspective. Not easy at all. I am not an accountant so I expect to at least find clear explanation of the information I am asked and include examples. Thole AMT's and bunch of depreciation. A completed "Failure". The whole purpose of using turbo tax is a DO IT YOURSELF tool but they spent no time trying to figure out an easy way to make the customer understand how to fill out certain topics like atomization, depreciation, car trade in. Also they use no standard depreciation which I believe that if I am inputting the amount of miles, the year of the car, how many mileage I used and I been doing the taxes with turbo tax for the last 5 years I assumed they had my information and could calculate it themselves or at least offer a standard depreciation. It took me like 3 weeks to do my taxes and 5 calls. I am done with this people. They should stick to personal taxes ONLY.
I haven't been able to get a solution to filing my Georgia Return. I never got an email telling me there was a problem with my Georgia Return, I just wondered where is my Georgia Return and I go to the site and says Rejected in one page and Pending on another. Turbotax can't explain it and they don't have a solution except to print and mail it. Well if I had gotten email on February 3 like I did for my Federal I could have done this already. So disappointed in them, last year I had problems with my identity. I won't be using them next year.
I've used Turbotax for three years now. I've always had little annoyances with the software that were out weighed by the good points. Not so this year. Here are a list of the problems with this year's version. The information imported from the previous tax year was incorrect and it took me at least 15 minutes to figure out how to correct it. I want to be able to go to the tax forms without going through the Q&A stuff, but there was no obvious way to do that. In past years there was a tab at the top that allowed me to go directly to the forms. I want to be able to make corrections on the forms. The system would not allow me to do that this year. Instead, I would have to go back through the Q&A sections again. I make contributions to many charities, there is no reason why I must itemize each of those charities and provide an address for each. It is very time consuming and not required by either the federal or state governments. I was unable to find a way to check off a contribution to the Presidential Election Campaign Fund. I sent messages to the help desk for assistance and I'm still waiting for a response. Is this a political statement by Intuit? That option should be easy for people to find and check off. And most egregious of all, when the amount of my refund was calculated and I was ready to file, Turbo Tax asked me if I wanted part of the return in the form of an Amazon gift card. I paid for Intuit to advertise Amazon to me?! It's really outrageous.
I've used Turbo Tax for many years to do my taxes. Always went fairly well. Until 2014. It appears Turbo Tax made some changes that are dishonest at best, pure stealing at worst. In filing my taxes this year I accidentally clicked on their more expensive "premier" product. But as I don't own a home, have rental income, and so forth - I don't need that product. The basic or deluxe (and cheaper) product would be fine for me. However, you cannot downgrade to a lower product. Your account gets tired to a particular product and Turbo Tax will not allow you to ever downgrade. You can only upgrade. Odd, so I called customer service. I am sure they guy was trying hard, but he was not able to switch my product either. The workaround is I will get charged for premier but after that, I can submit a request for refund to deluxe level price. No, thanks. I simply took my business to a different online tax company and started over.
I'll be nice and say that TurboTax's Customer Service staff is a bunch of amateurs. I had to make 5 calls before a problem with a State Tax form was resolved..and even then, the Rep told me to hit "Continue with Errors"... and then, TurboTax charged me to e-file the State form, even though I couldn't e-file because of the 'error.' (After I printed the form, it turned out a box that TurboTax said *had* to be filled-out, didn't.) Three of my calls were never returned (including one who I'd given permission to access my information... Lord knows how that'll haunt me in the future). A fourth put me on hold for 45-minutes ("It may be a problem with your Mac," she said, before she went to find IT. What is this? 1989?) Hey, if you've got simple taxes, TurboTax may be for you. But I suggest you think about signing up before you descend into hell the way I did.
I have used Turbo Tax for years. They have now changed their entire method of inputting information, and EVEN THEIR OWN CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVES ADMIT THEY ARE HAVING PROBLEMS WITH THE SOFTWARE. I have spent the last three hours on the phone with Turbo Tax and they cannot solve the problem. I have to finish my taxes in the next two days or so, or I cannot complete the FAFSA and my family could lose any college funding we might be able to receive. I am unable to understand why Turbo Tax's own techs can't figure out the software. How do they expect us to do so?
I filed my 2012 taxes using TT online premier as I have a renter in my home. I took my taxes to a tax professional this year and they reviewed last year's returns and found some startling issues. Turbo Tax did two things wrong. 1) They counted items such mortgage interest twice. 2) They allowed me to take a rental income loss which increased my refund considerably. You are not allowed to take a loss on a rental property if you occupy the space with the renter, which I do. You can only zero out your income and no more than that. This information (the % occupied by my renter, etc) was recorded during the TT process - it was very clear that it was shared space. In short, I will be amending my return and will be on the hook for well over $1000 plus interest. I would caution anyone who has used TT and thinks their return is higher than expected to have it checked out by a REAL tax professional. I would caution anyone to reconsider using Turbo Tax for any business related returns. Their software obviously is unable to keep up/keep track of the tax code.
I have done taxes at HR Block for past 7 years and no problems. A friend told us how he used to go thru HR Block also until he tried Turbo Tax and got a lot more back so we tried Turbo Tax. After paying the 100$ fees it was accepted. Three weeks later it shows deposited into our bank thru Turbo Tax website and IRS but yet no money.. Called IRS, apparently our checking number was put in as our social security number and routing as Turbo Tax... Why you might ask? The IRS representative said this is what tax companies do for first time customers so they get their share and then deposit it in to the customer's account.. Our taxes clearly show our bank numbers, not Turbo Tax's... What this mean? IRS said you will receive a paper check in 4 to 6 weeks because what they received as bank info wasn't even ours! The heck with you Turbo Tax... never again... And I'll be sure to tell all my colleagues and family and friends how my first experience with Turbo Tax was!
I logged into Turbotax to obviously file my taxes. I got to the end and was all excited, and then an offer came up. It was something along the lines of: Get your refund faster by filing them together for $36.99. They only gave two options. Yes and No, delete my state refund. I was told to select no, so I did and continued to file my Federal thinking the State would just come back up later. To finish filing my Federal, Turbotax charged me $21.00. It wouldn't let me go back in to file my State. It just kept taking me back to that stupid offer, so I just clicked yes and it went ahead and filed my State, and STILL charged me the $36.99 PLUS the $21.00 that I had just paid. This is the last time I use Turbotax. I told my S/O about what happened and he's not going to use Turbotax this year.
I have spent over 10 hours troubleshooting issues with TurboTax Online. I am getting caught in an endless loop during the "Error Check" process. Out of those 10 hours troubleshooting, over 3 of that has been with a TurboTax representative, and they were not even able to help. All they did was apologize and give me a code to file for free. The code is useless if the system will not let me get past the "Error Check" portion.
I requested direct deposit on Federal and State taxes. When I checked IRS website it said my Federal refund was being mailed. I called Turbo Tax and finally got to talk to someone after about 45 minutes on hold. The lady I talked to said I clicked on send a paper check. I told her that was not correct because I entered my bank information in on Federal side and it automatically transfers information to State side. She told me that I did request paper check and I again told her I did not that they must have a glitch in their system. I even told her that Turbo Tax said I would get refund direct deposited. It showed direct deposit for both Federal and State before I transmitted my refund. I searched help topics on Turbo Tax website and MULTIPLE people had the same problem. I keep checking their help section and there are still more people complaining about the same thing. So instead of them admitting that they have a problem they tell the customer they are wrong. SORRY WRONG ANSWER. They finally did admit that they had a problem on their help section and are trying to fix it. I did get my Federal refund in the mail two days after it was mailed. The State refund was direct deposited. Second problem is I did stepson's taxes and his State return was rejected because of an error. Well guess what... I went over his taxes three times and did what Turbo Tax said to do and all the numbers are correct. So it looks like they have yet another glitch. WILL NEVER USE TURBO TAX AGAIN.
For the second year in a row the software malfunctions. While they are trying to help it is apparent that this is a much wider issue that they cannot fix. I am fortunate to have access to several computers with different configurations and the same error occurs on each. I will not use their products again.
I found Turbo Tax Online Freedom Edition 2 years ago online. I used them for 2011 & 2012 tax returns and I was very satisfied with the service they provided. My spouse normally brings in some extra income by baby sitting or some other odd jobs. Her income requires a schedule C-EZ or a schedule c form for business income. These forms were included in the Turbo Tax Freedom Edition for my 2011 & 2012 returns. I jumped right in this year and began the tedious process of entering the info into the online Turbo Tax this year. I was caught totally by surprise when I discovered that Turbo Tax made the decision to take the schedule c or schedule c-ez out of their 2013 online freedom edition and move it to their $79 Turbo Tax Edition. I totally understand when a company makes a decision that a specific service should have a pricing change. I feel that Turbo Tax purposely failed to advise their returning customers about this major change hoping that they would continue the tax return and just fork up the $79 as they had used them previously and had already invested the time of entering data up to that point. It did not take but 5 minutes for me to find one of their competitors that offers this form within their free online tax programs. I stopped my return and refuse to use the Turbo Tax product. For me, this puts a bad light on this companies' moral and ethical business practices. They should have made their customers aware of this major pricing adjustment. Bait and Switch if you ask me.
I have filed with TurboTax for the last ten years with no issues at all. This year, there were all kinds of problems. After inputting all of the W2 information, I was told that I had entered no data, and ended up entering the information 3 different times. This happened on several of the pages. I also had trouble entering my dependents' information. Whatever changes they made to this year's software were not successful. I will seriously consider switching next year. Although I was able to complete the process and receive my refund, I was dissatisfied with the process which was a lot more complicated than past years.
I filed my taxes for 2010 in April of 2011. Once I received confirmation that it was accepted, I printed off all required paperwork to keep on file and I wrote checks, cause unfortunately, I had to pay. My checks cleared to the IRS as well as the State of Ohio within 3 business days. 18 months later, I receive notice from the IRS that my taxes were never filed/received. Of course I panic, dig out my proof of filing electronically, made copies, and mailed all info to the IRS along with the copies of cancelled checks. They sent a notice to me that they had received my copy but since they didn't receive the original filing 18 months previous, they charged me a "failure to file penalty" of $310.50. I tried to contact TurboTax, but the hold time was crazy and ended up hanging up before I could reach anyone, so I paid the penalty in hopes that when I did finally get a hold of TurboTax, I would be reimbursed. After a few more months, I get a notice from the State of Ohio stating the exact with them... They didn't receive my filing either. So again, I gather, copy, and send proof, but the State of Ohio didn't penalize me. I finally reached someone from TurboTax after 45 minutes, but was told that there was nothing they could do? My taxes are my responsibility. Well, duh... but you mean to tell me that if they don't submit your taxes, as they get paid to do, that they won't back their service? Heaven forbid if I get an audit. I will never use their "so called service" ever again. And to think I have used them every year until 2011. Mistakes happen, I know this, but at least man up to your mistakes and make it right.
2013 TurboTax has to be the worst format I have ever seen. Took 4x longer to do than previous years. After filling out itemized deductions took forever trying to figure out if that was being used or the standard deduction. Can't see the electronic 1040 to review unless you pay first and that's after going through all kinds of sales junk to buy useless add-ons.
Someone logged into our account and filed our taxes using their email, account, and routing number. We called Turbo Tax immediately following the occurrence and multiple times thereafter. They kept telling us there is nothing they could do and we would just have to wait and see if we got our refund. Our refund was deposited into the thief's account yesterday. I called Turbo Tax yet again last night and the response was "You will have to contact the IRS. Your account information could and should have been changed when you initially called, but since it wasn't, there is nothing we can or will do for you." The IRS says that they simply follow instructions from Turbo Tax, which is correct. Turbo Tax will not assist and has not assisted. They do not care that someone hacked into their system and identity theft and tax fraud occurred. Everyone needs to know there is security issues within Turbo Tax. Your information is NOT safe!
Folks! Double check the amount of tax you owe based on taxable income. Turbo Tax has been putting incorrect due taxes and made me over pay by 2k last year... Now I have to file an amended return to get the money back. Go to IRS.GOV and check the tax table to verify the income tax you are suppose to pay based on your taxable income... Then never use Turbo Tax again.
Having used Turbo Tax for years I assumed that the premier addition could guide me through the sale of rental estate. What I found is their inadequate instructions to establish a Basis, or Adjusted basis. It automatically added past depreciation $52000+ when actual was 1500+. As a result I have to go to a tax professional to file correctly. Very upset, won't make the mistake of using any of their products again!
Soooo....people filed their taxes online after me and got their refund already....I'm pissed to the max....I think it's because I didn't do my state tax this year with you guys....I'm pissed off....and guess what....I'm going to Jackson Hewitt next year and forever after this year....Everyone that filed with Jackson Hewitt this year that I know already got their refund back....This is it turbo tax.....You guys officially suck....No more of my business.....Jackson Hewitt.....Here I come.....
I have a pension, which they mistakenly put as earned income three years in the running. This year all my pre-saved info showed correctly that I had not earnings, when reviewing past returns I realized they put that money in the wrong box, and now I may be liable to repay those refunds.... Turbo tax free is a total rip off.
When I completed my taxes on 2/3/14, TurboTax told me I had to hard-copy file my Mass. state taxes. No explanation; just a line at the bottom of their "filing instructions" page saying I could return to the site to e-file. That didn't make much sense - why couldn't I e-file right away? Why would I have to return to the site? But I figured I'd have my paper W-2 pretty soon and it wasn't a big deal. So I printed my Mass. tax return and waited to receive my paper W-2. When I didn't receive my W-2 after a week, I went back to the site (2/9/14) and searched for the page where I could return to e-file. Various customer Q&As showed e-filing was possible for Mass. returns. Took me over an hour to find the page to direct TurboTax to e-file my Mass. return. Along the way, various customer Q&As, as well as replies by TurboTax employees, showed that TurboTax knew all along that Mass. wasn't accepting e-filing right away. I stress "along the way," because it took me over an hour of searching to find the right page to tell TurboTax to e-file my Mass. return; and in the end, I found it completely by accident. There was nothing straightforward or expected about how to get to that page. I don't understand why TurboTax wasn't just up-front about this from the beginning and why they made it so hard to return to the appropriate page to e-file my Mass. return. I don't believe this is a matter of *deliberately* misleading customers; it's just d*mned poor customer service, very annoying. Especially since they charged my credit card when I completed my taxes on 2/3. I've used TurboTax for over a decade, and they've lost a customer. Never again.
I have used TurboTax for a number of years without a significant problem. However the 2013 software/updates have completely wiped out ALL my tax copies/records all the way back to 2007. Here is how things unfolded: Received and loaded the TurboTax disc for 2013. It did not automatically bring in the 2012 tax records, but I had no problem importing them into the 2013 software. From then until now I would periodically check for updates to the software and download them to my 2013 software. Everything was fine until the last time I completed this process. UPON COMPLETION OF THE LATEST UPDATE I SOON LEARNED THAT ALL MY TAX RETURNS WERE WIPED OUT GOING BACK TO 2007. I contacted TurboTax technical support seeking help in finding out how to get the files back (unfortunately I did not back up the files myself - I will not make that mistake again). The technical support person was of NO HELP. Basically all she told me was she did not know what keys I pressed, implying I deleted the files. I subsequently had a tech support consultant (who owns a tech support company) come over to see if he could recover the tax returns. Bottom line he said they are gone and the TurboTax software did it. He stated there was no way I could have created this condition. Fortunately, this only involves 8-10 people's returns which means I need to start from scratch to do their 2013 returns. The bigger issue is losing the info on depreciation for rental property and capital loss carry forwards. I would be interested to know if anyone else has experienced this problem and if they know of any magic to get the files back. Thanks.
When I prepared my return, I checked the box regarding Direct Deposit into my checking account. I inputted my routing and account number. Few days when I went into "Where's My Refund," lo and behold I see where my refund will be sent BY MAIL! What? I see similar problems regarding this from other Turbo Tax users. Unfortunately it's nothing I can do at this point. I will NEVER EVER use them again!!
My son's tax return process got hung up at a screen which said "Oops, you've been bumped from TurboTax. Just sign in again." And when I signed in again, using his user name and password, I was told I had the wrong user name or password. Then I would ask for a password reset link to be emailed to our email, and I would be able to reset it and enter the site. BUT then when I had "logged in," and clicked on continue 2013 return, I got the "Oops" page again. Every time I signed back in, his password or user name was "wrong" again. I would have a password reset link sent - - - - - over and over and over. Every single time I tried to continue with his tax return, the same problem. I finally got to a little of the bottom of this Intuit cesspool when I realized they were offering to send the password reset link to a totally different email address!! The email address was clearly that of a customer whose name was the same as my son's. Obviously, they had chosen the same user name, and Intuit kept mistaking one for the other at the password level. No doubt this other person was encountering the same problem, and every time they tried to get in they were resetting the password from their end. The representative at Intuit, once I got through to 888-777-3066, spent five hours with me on the phone. She was very patient, and she understood the two problems, the mashed pair of accounts and the frustrating Error 103 "Oops" stalemate. However, in spite of the five hours actually, more like five and a quarter hours, she and her supervisors were unable to help us at all. I cannot believe that Turbotax/Intuit is so out of control of their own code. Their representative did her very best, and she was no fool. But she works for a fool and now I realize only a fool would use her employer's services in a transaction where any kind of competence or privacy is essential.
I have been a loyal customer of Turbo Tax for 20 years, always give it high ratings. This tax year (2013) there seems to be a problem if you have a deceased individual on your return. It appears to be rejecting a high majority of these returns for numerous consumers, according to the TurboTax website. Very frustrating to deal with not being able to file my return (even though all has been verified as correct; including calls to SSA and IRS) electronically, as a result. They need to get this fixed.
I file my taxes through TurboTax today and when I got the result it was a lot lower than last year. Went back to a different website and plug in the numbers and I came up with almost $500 more what is TurboTax missing. When I look up on TurboTax while my return was so low they explained to me that it was because I made more this year therefore have to pay more taxes. I'm at 11,000 dollars last year, 12000 this year. Now I have to amend my return, thanks turbo tax.
There is either a problem with PIN numbers or inadequate explanations of how to use same. I have used TurboTax for a number of years without issue. This year, not so much. After my first rejection, both state and federal, I followed all instructions. I did call the IRS for a new PIN and was advised that I did not need a PIN. This does not square with the Turbo Tax program. I tried again, no joy. Luckily the post office is still in business since that appeared to be my only option left. It is beyond me how something so simple could get so screwed up. I may look for a different software next year.
The system requests information about HSA contributions and then files the information as an excess contribution. Once I filed my return and saw what had happened, it was too late. Now I have to file an amendment. This is a major problem that needs to be corrected. I filed a complaint on the Intuit website and told them I would not be using TurboTax in the future until they get this resolved.
This is the fourth year doing business with this company. The last year they messed up my state returns and told me I was getting a refund when in fact, I owed the state money. This is only one of the problems, they offer a "Net spend Premier" card that has the absolute worst customer service. They told me I wouldn't be able to access my money unless I sent some company in India a photocopy of my Driver's License, Social Security card, and a bill with my name and address on it. Why in the hell would I have to send them this information after I had to call and confirm my Social Security number, my address, and my full name? I am never using Turbotax again, they always mess my taxes up, they claim to be free when in fact their fees end up totaling over 200 dollars for something you can file for 70 dollars at H&R Block. $30 per state plus an additional $30 to wire your money to your account? What a load of horse **.
I did my taxes with Turbo tax, second year, and I have to file an amended return as I got screwed (almost) out of 1200 dollars and the system messed up both states returns! The software is so messed up for the first time I was to pay 7800.00 dollars to my state return as the system is broken and isn't crediting my other states taxes paid. And the credit for dependents isn't crediting my return for 1200 dollars. I ended up going to a competitor and re-doing my taxes to correct them and now have to file amended returns to the feds and the states costing me 57 dollars for the first time to turbo tax and 28 bucks to their competitor to do it right! And I wrote them about it and forget trying to get them to fix it. Amend your return.
I have spent six hours reading FAQ's, other comments and suggestions. I have called support and was on hold as caller #7 in the queue and waited an hour before I hung up. I have used TT for approximately 15 years and have never had a problem until this year and it looks like I am not the only one. Why isn't someone fixing this issue?
I have been using TurboTax for the last three years. I rated them a 10 this year before my return was rejected three times. When I tried to correct the same issue for the 3rd time, it states that there was nothing to file at the time. The IRS is closed, how can they reject my return at 8 pm within 5 minutes of me filing when the very first time I had to wait 24 hrs? I sure hope this isn't a scam. I am still on hold (for 16 minutes now) and no one has answered from this company yet.
I have been using TurboTax for a few years and it was easy, and you knew what you were paying for. Now, this year is hell; and they have the nerve to charge for state taxes on a state that doesn't do state taxes - Florida. And they keep on rejecting my refund even after they have error. Checked it many times and they keep on wanting to charge me more each time. They need to have the people from before because these jerks are only screwing and scheming.
I have used TurboTax for YEARS and all my family and in laws come over and prepare their taxes using my computer on TurboTax. This year my Brother in law and I were working on his taxes last night and when we began the process, just after log in in, the software asked us to "click all that apply" and they would help "choose" the product right for him. This was a new option I have not seen in the past. He clicked single and own a home. Then it just said "we've decided Deluxe is right for you". We could not get out of deluxe and get back to anything that would let us choose the free edition. At this point we stopped and contacted customer service before entering even his name. We were told to enter everything and let them know when we were on the payment page. Once there, it took over 45 mins to get a product code that we thought was going to bring us back to the usual FREE product. Instead we were still charged 19.99 for the basic. We told them we wanted the FREE one we use every year, and they replied back that we had wanted the basic version that was 19.99. We replied that we just wanted the free version that we use EVERY year, whatever that is called. My biggest problem is that they acted like this was our choosing and then changing our minds, and they were doing us this big "one time favor" by crediting us down, when in fact we did NOT choose deluxe. We should have been able to go back before entering ANY information and choose free. We wanted the FREE edition we used every year. After the 45min chat session we just got too frustrated with the snarky customer service guy and have decided that all 6 returns my family does each year using TurboTax would this year be done using another software provider.
I have used TurboTax for years and it has been great. This year there was a new box to check if you wished to purchase their audit services for $39.95. I DID NOT check that box. I then zipped through checkout, choosing to have my fee deducted from my refund. To my great surprise, today I get an email confirming my purchase of the audit services and it will be deducted from my refund. I researched on their site this problem and found a answer that for California the charge is bundled, even if you DO NOT choose to purchase it - you have to actually manually remove it at checkout. Is this ethical or even legal?
This company offers a yearly subscription, provide a credit card, pre-pay and a yearly tax program download is provided. However, when downloading, you are directed to the buy products webpage and may inadvertently repurchase the prepaid product. You may only notice this if you pay close attention to your bank statements. This lack of transparency in a company entrusted with confidential personal information is not very reassuring.
I will never use them again. I put down for both my Federal and State Taxes to be direct deposit. The web site said that both are filed and with direct deposit. When I downloaded the info to save my forms, the forms said that I would receive my Federal Refund in a paper check in Four to Five weeks! I was so upset! I called them and waited forever; they had no answers; told me I could call the IRS when my forms were accepted. I don't think the customer service rep had any idea of what she was doing! I asked for a refund; they did give it to me; but, it took forever for her to do it. They said the refund for the services would take up to 90 days! I have used Tax Act without any problems in the past. I tried Turbo Tax because the websites said they were number one so I decided to give it a try! I wish I had investigated further before using them. I really needed my refund sooner than four to five weeks this year!
After filing my taxes without incident. I filed my daughters and it was rejected because I refused to purchase from Obamacare because my daughter has privately funded health care. Upon trying endlessly to get live chat going unsuccessfully I found a phone number to call. The wait was over 40 mins, no big deal. Then I was put thru to someone who said, let me connect you with health care; it's a minimal wait. The system then came on and said "there are no callers ahead of you. Your wait is less than 1 minute." After 40 mins of wait time the line was DISCONNECTED. This customer service is below substandard...it was annoying enough to NEVER use them again. No help, no explanations, long wait and a disconnect. And I am paying these people. I'll tell everyone who will listen. You have a question about your tax return from turbotax? You are on your own. Worst tax preparation I've ever used.
My return was rejected due to an error with PIN. I obtained corrected PIN but it will not let me back into the system to make corrections. It did not let me print anything out prior to this step. Can I give up on TT and purchase another brand? TT used to be very good, but the whole system is not near what it used to be...
I got Turbo Tax Premier. I went through the program and got to the filing page. I didn't want to pay to efile my state tax and thought that I would be able to print it and mail it myself. I didn't see this option so I called them and asked how to do this. I was told to delete the state tax and I would get an option to print the state later and I would not be charged. I never saw this option. I called again and was told that I had to pay the same charge to print the state as I would to efile it. In other words I had to pay an extra $37 just to be able to print my state tax return. This was after I had already paid to efile the federal tax return. Bait and switch and/or incompetent customer service. Don't use this product!!!! Find another cheaper alternative where you are given correct information the first time and not lied to to get more money. I did what I was supposed to do - I called and asked and was lied to to get more money.
First, let me say that as far as the job TT does, I have no problems with them. My only complaint is with their fees. I have used TT for the past 3 years (this being the 4th). I got the screen asking me to select some options so it could decide which version worked best for me. After my selections, it recommended the Federal Free Edition. It should have because this is what I'd used the past 3 times. Also, I should point out that if you select the free edition, the charge for filing your state return along with your federal return is 14.99. This was fine because state returns are never free. Anyway, after selecting this, it goes to the screen to start the actual return and is clearly labeled TurboTax Deluxe. There is absolutely no way to change this. The only options it gives at that point are to upgrade to more expensive versions. The deluxe version was 22.99, and honestly, the price isn't that bad... but they give you no other option than to take it. Here's what really set me off though. The price for filing my state return ALSO went up in price, by that same $22 dollars, from $14.99 to $36.99!!! I'd already finished my taxes, so I went ahead and paid the fees because I didn't want to start over somewhere else, but I will NEVER use TurboTax again.
My income for this past year is well under $20,000, but when I went to enter the income from a sale of stock valued at $150, TurboTax insisted that I had to buy the Premier package for $49.99. I've used this tax software for many years now and I've never had this problem before. Obviously they've created this new rule to bilk poor people like me of whatever they can, as people with more complicated investment income would most likely use an accountant anyway. It's absurd that it would cost me $50 to report an additional $150 of income. At that cost, why wouldn't I go to an H&R Block or find a cheaper online tax service? Additionally, they are on the list of services a person making under $58,000 may use for free, according to the IRS website. It seems fraudulent to make that claim given my experience.
Turbo Tax advertises that it can "easily import prior year tax data from TurboTax and other tax software brands." The CD program (Mac) has a feature in it that implies that this will happen if you have your prior year H&R Block At Home return available in PDF format, but it doesn't work. I tried communicating with TurboTax via chat first. The chat representative was completely ignorant with this claim and told me it was impossible. I tried calling on the phone but gave up after 30 minutes on hold listening to horrible music. The FAQ on the website does not exactly cover this question. Instead, it basically says that importing PDF files is, in most cases, impossible. One of the reasons I switched to TurboTax this year was that claim, along with the reviews I read stating that TurboTax is the best tax prep software. I haven't used it to prepare my 2013 taxes yet, but the first claim it made is definitely false. It makes me wonder how many other claims are also false. Beware!
I filed with TurboTax because my wife has been filing for years. I did free fed non-FFA. I was charged for state. I called and called. They never gave refund. I was getting 394. They took out 60.00 and change. They are really bad. Customer service is bad. Mind you I did this a year ago. They kept my money. Please beware, do not use.
I have been notified by IRS that for both 2011 and 2012 my reported Retirement Income tax was incorrect. I retired in 2011 and have used turbo tax for many years, I was quite surprised to find the program incorrectly entered the correct taxable amount of my retirement income. I think this is the fault of their program and should not be held against consumers whom used turbo tax an approved IRS tax filing program. I have not heard back from turbo tax after posting my dismay on their community board.
If you have a child who is disabled and pays for more than 50% of their own support TurboTax does not recognize that this child qualifies for the EIC (Earned Income Credit) calculation credit. TurboTax will let you complete and file your return leaving you without the additional credit that may be as much as $2000.00. I have previously reported this problem with no response. It has now existed for several years. Taxpayers who have disabled children should review previous year returns to see if they should file an amended return.
I ran into two granular issues with multiple year TTax filings that cost me considerable additional tax with penalties. The first was a backdated 5 year recoup by IRS, after an audit where I had to fly on and present evidence, caused by a limitation on carryover period for business loss. At the five year anniversary, with debt carried over, IRS collected all taxes due. Had I not entered the debt in Year 5 I would not have had to pay $3700 on a $5400 debt. My issue or TT's...you decide. A simple warning msg from TT would have helped. Second was IRS HAWAII State claiming TT allowed mortgage insurance deductions at Fed level which are not allowable when filing Hawaii State taxes. Audit trip was 2 hrs away and, according to Hi IRS, a TT program error. When filing directly from Fed to state, a correction based on Hi tax regs critical. Cost was $2317 tax and penalty from 2010 and 11. TT a useful tool...I have now paid to learn that it is best to have a hardcopy filing reviewed ... or face prospect of audit(s).
I have used Turbo Tax for the last 5-6 yrs and every year it gets worse. What they do is somehow get you to fill out your info with the basic 19.99 version. Even though you think you are using the free version. Then once you're finished they tell you your charges. Who wants to do it all over again? Well I tried and it just continually takes me to the Basic 19.99 version as soon as I sign in. I'm over Turbo Tax and their deceitfulness to consumers.
Recently, the IRS disallowed an excess social security tax credit from my 2011 return. I called Turbo Tax, briefly explained the issue, and without hesitation, their support person told me that I had incorrectly entered both my W-2 data and my wife's W-2 data under one social security number. I stated that I believed that was not possible, but if that were the case, the alleged 350 error checks that Turbo Tax ran should have flagged a mistake of that magnitude. The support person became nasty when I suggested that Turbo Tax was culpable for possible software coding errors in their calculations. I encourage everyone to take his or her business elsewhere.
Been using these "free" jokers for years. Never had problems till now. Did both my state and federal. Got a refund of several thousand from the feds. Ended up owing the state of Michigan. Opted to pay with a credit card, rather than pay to have them take it out of my return. Thought all was good. Now, I'm getting nasty grams from the state for the money. Was able to track the transaction down with my bank. Turns out they sent it to the feds instead. The ones who I had a refund of several thousand. This 180 bucks now is $350 with fees and interest. It has also been sent to collections. This was Turbo's screw up. I feel they should pay the penalty. I can't even get anyone on the phone. Emails... unanswered. These guys suck. Feel lucky compared to the horror stories I've been reading. So when does the class action start?
Form 4562 is saying I claimed a property for 2 million dollars for two different tax years and this was brought to my attention yesterday by a lawyer?? I have never owned a house or property? What do I do, I can’t even get a hold of anyone at the IRS?? The phone number has a message saying they are not available?
TurboTax offers free e-file but during the last two years (2011-2012 tax years), they have changed the prompts to be deceptive. The prompts makes you believe you are doing the free version but you have been switched to the paid version and at the end when you try to file you are asked for $19.99. There is a class action out against TurboTax for deception not on this issue but another issue.
If you want to feel like a beginner, use Intuit Tax Online. This is 2013; however you would never know it to see their software. The format they have chosen is very awkward. It has no similarity to the forms. You fill in boxes. Very difficult to get continuity in relation to what you have been using. Why they have written the program like this is anybody's guess. Since you can efile their regular Turbotax using the appearance of the regular tax forms, IRS will certainly accept that format??? I have been doing taxes since the days of Reagan & the tax restructuring in 1986. Sad program.
In 2010, it messed up my HSA and the IRS kindly sent me a correction, with a check in my favor. This year I waited till September and was that smart? As soon as I started TurboTax, it downloaded several important fixes that were not fixed until after April 15. NOTE: Intuit does NOT inform its customers that they may need to re-do their taxes. They leave it up to you to fend for yourself. My most effective tool: I wrote a complaint to the president of the company two years ago, and I got the kind of help I needed, plus a free copy of the 2011 version. However, they do not fix their problems permanently; they just put it on the market.
I've used TurboTax for over 5 years now. For the last 3 years, I've had problems with it saving information I entered in federal and state taxes. This year it failed to save the status of my daughter attending college and the information I entered to receive credit for my property tax. Each year, I ended up spending more than an hour on the phone with a support person correcting. For me, this is three strikes and you're out. I can't understand why their software doesn't save what you enter.
I have used Turbo Tax for the last five years and swore by their service, until today. I received a letter from the IRS stating that some nontaxable income was not included in my 2009 return, so I needed to pay it because they overpaid me on the renter's rebate. I looked at my return and found that my return, indeed, says that I did include the nontaxable income. I called the IRS back, but they said that their return does not have it and that I should call Turbo Tax. So I called Turbo Tax, and the woman on the phone said sorry but she only had information on me for 2010. I said that's impossible, that I have used them for the past five years. She transferred me to a manager ("Heather", from "Upstate New York"), who again told me I did not use their services in 2009. I repeatedly told her I had a copy from Turbo Tax, was looking at my account through them online at that very point, and that I, too, held a copy of my return, so how is it that they have no information on me? She was very rude, talked over me continuously, and was literally laughing at me because she was repeating herself like I was stupid. I asked her for the contact name or number of someone above her, but she said there wasn't anyone. I told her surly she didn't own the company and there had to be someone else I can speak to, but she kept saying no. I eventually ended the conversation, saying there was nothing she could help me with and I would have to take matters into my own hands. I am beyond frustrated and offended. I will no longer go through them and will encourage others to do so, as well. Even if there was nothing they could have done for me, if they would have had someone who was nice to me, listened to me, and cared about helping me, then I would be continuing my service with them. However, their customer service had me feeling so put down in the end that I won't use them anymore.
I used Turbo Tax for a couple years then got wise that there are free programs that do just as well! This year I opted to use a free one and I made out pretty well. I sign on my checking account this morning to see that intuit has debited $80.23 from my checking. I start calling and can't reach anyone until 11 am (different time zone). The person on the phone is not American so I have trouble even understanding him. He wants me to give him all my checking information. I tell him I am not comfortable with that and he tells me then he can't help! Really because if you have my info and obviously you do because you took money from me, why do I need to give it to you again? Something smells bad here! I am going through the bank for unauthorized transaction to get my money returned. I don't understand why they let someone use a card or checking or anything that obviously didn't match their return! The flip side of this with the "it is your problem" attitude they gave me is that I won't use them ever again. I also have a truck payment due and food to buy and now living on a budget I am $80 short! I am not proud, I live from paycheck to paycheck and they act like it is no big deal!
I'm an expat in Kenya, claiming the foreign income exclusion. Downloaded the Premier edition in late May. While filling in the blanks, my return suddenly went from a refund to owing over $7,000. I finally tracked down the error (using the forms), and then did the 1st review - passed. Then did the 2nd review and passed. Then tried to e-file and TurboTax found 4 errors it had missed in the two reviews. The error messages were less than helpful (e.g. FMV of other property, etc). Took half an hour to discover that my return needed a $0 in two places! Then I tried to e-file again, only to be told that I had to download a new copy of TurboTax. Remember, I'd downloaded my copy in late May! So it took almost an hour to download the 92.5 MB (yes, we're in a place where the internet service is very slow!). Finally, the e-file went through, but a poor experience.
In past years I have always printed my tax return on Turbo Tax and mailed it in. It has always been simple with clear instructions. This year I could not find the method for printing the return. After much searching, I was able to find the print method. But then TT kept telling me it was better to file electronically. After going ahead and printing my return, I found that the bank deposit information for my return had all been filled with xx's. I then used White-Out to refill the information. IRS and state did mail me a check in 3-4 weeks, not the 2 to 3 months that TT said it would take if I did not file electronically. My question is why does TT go to great lengths to keep you from submitting a paper return? I would think if TT was working for you, they would not care if you submitted by paper or electronically - which raises the further question of what other information are they submitting to the IRS about you, since you do not have an original document that you are legally going to be held liable by the IRS? This paper document would normally be your total tax attestation. Also, with a computer file the IRS could unleash a worm to look at millions of files for thousands of items to target rather than having a person making a rationale judgment of the issue. Yes, you could end up fighting with the dreaded computer. So I raise the question again, is Turbo Tax working for you or the IRS?
TurboTax interrogation asked me in the Business section if I planned to make a contribution to my Traditional IRA. I said yes and entered the amount which the software allowed and made the contribution after filing the return but certainly before April 15. Afterwards, I find out that my contribution to my Traditional IRA was classified as an SEP contribution which was not mentioned at all in the interrogation. Other areas in the business section were referred to as SEP's, but not the Traditional IRA. The contribution was not deductible and the resulting change cost me $6000! Thanks, TurboTax. Please draw your own conclusions and use them carefully, if at all!
MI has two different forms for claiming the homestead property tax. Turbo Tax printed one page from one form and one page from the other form. MI bounced the return. It was refiled with the correct forms and is now subject to an audit.
We use Turbo Tax every year. We moved this past year, and while I updated my address, I realized too late that I did not update our new bank information. I read about what would happen if they tried to direct deposit my refund and sadly realized I'd have to wait for a paper check when the refund did not go through to our old account. Well, lo and behold, our refund showed up in our brand new account. In addition, Turbo Tax was supposed to deduct their fees directly from our refund but said they did not and are now sending me emails telling me they are going to debit that very same account. How in heck did they get our account information? Not only that, what right do they have to debit a checking account that I never gave them authorization to use? Really distressing to say the least. I will not be using them again.
E-file rejected multiple times with no content errors - I ended up printing out and mailing paper copies… kicking it old school. Never buying Turbo again!
The figure Turbo Tax gave my daughter as her refund and the figure that Turbo Tax tiled with IRS are different by about $2,000. She has tried many times to call Turbo Tax, but gets nothing but attitude and no help. They try to blame it on IRS, but it clearly shows that Turbo Tax was the one that messed up. Couple of months later and my daughter still can't get Turbo Tax to even look at the problem. She actually went to another site and did her taxes again (without filing them) and sure enough, the correct amount due her was exactly the same as Turbo Tax showed on her hard copy paperwork - not the wrong figure that Turbo Tax sent in to the IRS. What will get their attention?
After I had completed everything and received the message from TurboTax that everything was fine, I tried to print (unsuccessfully). When I attempted again (unsuccessfully) to go back to my saved files, they were gone. I restarted TurboTax and still not there. So I redid all of the work. The files saved and I was able to print them, but I still couldn't e-file. I received the message that my saved files were corrupt! I was out of time to enter all my information again and when I restarted for the 3rd time, again all the original information was completely missing. So I tried to file an extension. However, it wouldn't allow me to complete the NYS extension form. I attempted this process 3 times as well until I ultimately had to go to another online site to e-file an extension for both federal and state. Accordingly, my filing was late by 14 minutes for the state and I will pay a penalty for this! I'm not even mentioning the number of times I would ask a question while on the site, only to be directed to advertisements for TurboTax. Then when I was on the screen I wanted, it would bounce back to the ads. I am absolutely livid. I spent over 9 hours doing what should have taken no more than 4 hours and I ended up with nothing from TurboTax, except the cost of the software and what will turn out to be a penalty from the state. I've used TurboTax for years, so my problems were not due to my own inability to use the software correctly. I know how to do this. It was absolute garbage. There wasn't even a phone number to call anyone at TurboTax, despite their saying that you can directly call someone. What responsibility does TurboTax take on for the failure in all of this?
After using TurbotTax for my 2011 tax return, Intuit sent me a CD for my 2012 return. My income is limited to social security and a small dividend. My income does not register on tax radar. After installing the CD and answering a couple of questions, I was directed to pay $59.99 by credit card to continue the process; which I did. While finishing the forms, I was directed to the free Turbotax return for people with no itemized deductions. However, the e-filing would cost $27.99. To complete the e-filing, I would have to pay again by credit card; which I did. Intuit did not provide a summary of charges or even an explanation. My credit card was charged $27.99 on March 22 and $59.99 on March 23. Intuit charged my $59.99 for a free return and then $27.99 for an e-filing, which is free with the $59.99 Deluxe return. Contacting Intuit, the representative told me that I had downloaded the Deluxe Edition for $59.99 and then used the free edition which had resulted in the charge for e-filing. In other words, it was my fault for following their directions. As for me, I consider their charging practices deceptive if not downright fraudulent. They took me to the cleaners this year. There will be no next year. Use Intuit at your own risk.
I used TurboTax to file my 2010 taxes. My husband withdrew $110,000.00 from his retirement as he had become disabled and had filed for but was not receiving disability yet. TurboTax asked two questions (1. Do you or your spouse receive disability? My answer - No! 2. Did you or your spouse leave work due to a disability? My answer - Yes!). TurboTax entered the $110,000.00 and the $22,000.00 we paid at the time of withdrawal in federal income tax on the appropriate lines. Then on the calculation line, they entered $11,000.00 as the amount we were required to pay taxes on. I assumed due to the above two questions. We were notified by IRS in 2012 that we failed to report $99,000.00 in retirement income, and that we owed $19,500.00 plus $5,458.00 in late fees and penalties. I paid an additional fee to TurboTax for audit support. However, I have yet to be able to contact a human being through internet or by telephone. My lawyer says that TurboTax has to pay all late fees and penalties, but that my husband and I have to pay the $19,000.00. I will never use TurboTax again and will be sure that my friends don’t either. I have faithfully paid my taxes for 40 years without incident.
I knew I had to pay additional Fed tax. I had all the forms filled out and passed the reviews. I waited until April 14th to e-file. Return was rejected. I followed T-Tax instructions and resubmitted. It was still rejected, and I saw that many others were having the same problem. Their help page was a joke. So I had to print out Fed and State returns and mail them on the 15th. I have used this product for over 10 years but will not be using it again!
I'm disabled and have no income other than my Social Security. I filled out my tax forms using Intuit TurboTax software acquired from the Mac App store and they won't even let me print my forms without paying them $64.99 - and that's not including any e-file fees! I'm going to the store and getting another product at 5:15 pm on the 15th!
Last year I had a good experience with TurboTax, this year, not so. I used TurboTax to file my 2012 Federal Income Taxes just yesterday. I entered their site by going through a link in my Charles Schwab account (like last year). This was convenient because they pull information (dates and numbers) from the brokerage account and fill them in the proper forms. All seemed to go well. I did a quick online review, paid by credit card, and then submitted the 1040 with electronic filing. Later, I printed the forms and took a closer look. That's when I realized the bank routing number and account number were wrong! Now, shame on me for not double checking that. But I made a terrible assumption that since TurboTax was pulling information from Charles Schwab; it had pulled my CS Bank numbers (as I had used the same last year). I did not enter those incorrect numbers; their system put them in. That's what's scary. Where did they come from? Was TurboTax hacked? Anyway, I called TT as soon as possible and told them the situation. They gave me the number of the IRS and said I need to call them (it's Sunday and tomorrow is April 15, so this should be interesting, trying to get through to them in the morning!). From what I've read, the IRS may be able to cancel the direct deposit and issue me a check. I'm praying so. Besides the hassle and possibility of someone else getting my deposit, what really bothers me is TurboTax Support didn't really seem concerned. I would have thought at least they would have asked for the bogus account numbers to follow up on or even my name and number. Must not be that big of a deal! Maybe it happens every day. I don't know, but be aware and double check if you’re using TT.
After spending two hours filing my 2012 federal taxes on Turbo Tax free website, Turbo Tax indicated that they would not file my 2012 federal taxes using their free website, unless I paid them $29.99 and University Financial Corp. $34.99. Two of the reasons cited on the website for which you would be charged a fee for using their website was that you either asked to be upgraded or that your tax form was so complex that they would have to charge you a fee. I never requested to be upgraded, and my filing only involved income from two employers and income from my state unemployment compensation. I do not own a home or have any investments, which accrue interest. I don't even have children that I could use as deductions for my taxes paid. My tax filing was just simple and very straightforward. I would have appreciated Turbo Tax's disclosure that there was a fee for using their website beforehand. I would have then been able to make a decision as to whether I wanted to pay the fee before spending all that time inputting information into a website, which was purported to be a free website for filing your federal taxes. Instead, the fees were introduced only when it was time to sign the form to be submitted. I very highly resent being duped by Turbo Tax in this manner. I had used them once before and I was never charged a fee to use their free service. And this year, after wasting all my time entering all my tax information on their website, and for fear that both my time and efforts would just be wasted, I felt that I had to go ahead and pay this undisclosed fee to Turbo Tax. Due to this dishonesty, I will never use their services again.
About 3 years ago, we started using Turbo Tax to file our tax returns. Since we owed this year to the Feds, he didn’t file until last Saturday. You know how much info is on the tax returns, including your bank account number. Sunday morning I got a call from the credit card company that we only use for net shopping. I hadn’t used the card in at least a month before that. He asked if we had charged $19.99 to Turbo Tax, and I said yes. Then he asked if I had charges of $1,024.00 at Wal-Mart. No! Nada, etc. So he destroyed the account, as I did the card, and said a new one would be on its way. And no, we wouldn’t be charged the $1,000.00 and their Fraud Dept. would look into the problem. So, in order to protect any and all info, we called the credit bureaus and Federal Trade Commission to report the identity theft. Then he called Turbo (Intuit) and was on hold for over half an hour, finally telling the story 4 times letting them know that their secure site was not secure. Monday I called the bank’s main office and she said she’d put a note on the account, but I should really go into our branch and talk to them. I did. The safest way is to open up a new account (the old one is frozen with the numbers of the 3 outstanding checks noted and to be paid) and then ordering new checks, paying for the speedy new ones because I refuse to use the phony checks for the new account that they give you. The new checks should be here tomorrow. Whew! How inconvenient this whole thing has been. Of course now without the new net card, our other cards on watch for 90 days, and no real checks, I have this overwhelming desire to go shopping! LOL
TurboTax messed up the direct debit payment for my 2012 taxes. I wasted four hours trying to talk to them and get it fixed. Nobody helped and I ended up owing bounced check fees to the IRS. I'm never using them again and I hope that others will also take this into account.
I bought TurboTax for $60+ at BestBuy to do my taxes easily (supposedly), but I have been working on it for 2 weeks and it keeps telling me that some forms are not available. I updated the software so many times and still no avail. Now, I have 3 days and it still gives me an error that my e-filing didn’t go through. I tried so many times. I called customer service and finally got hold of someone after 45 mins, but she transferred me and I was on hold for another 30 mins. Then she said she would transfer me again but couldn’t hold on the phone anymore. TurboTax is a waste of money, time, and effort!
I will never use TurboTax again. First off, I used the free basic addition to complete my minor's taxes; it ended up trying to charge me for federal, state, and audit support. I then went through the IRS to use the free tax software and had to delete the information I entered previously and start all over. After re-entering the info, TurboTax again tried to charge me for audit support; and when trying to remove the add-on charge, I am sent to an error page. It has been two days and I am not going to use another software program such as H&R Block. My final complaint is try and get customer support beyond looking at questions and answers. Impossible. I will never use TurboTax again! Period!
Since the inception of e-filing state and federal taxes, TT was my third vendor in a 5-year period. I chose TT mainly for the addition of the HSA 8889 distribution form online, as my previous vendor did not support it (although their website said they did). So off I went. It appeared to be sensible, thorough and fair. I was upgraded to Basic as a 1040 is needed to file an 8889 as well. I figured I will pay the fees and get it over with. A few things bother me. For one, the continuous solicitation for their Operation Homeland foundation. I began to suspect a political alignment. Further, when I was reviewing my return, I see I signed some sort of agreement that they will be sending me "updates" on the issue of the Affordable Health Care Act (and I quote: "also known as ObamaCare") since I have an HSA. And to think that I spent a measly $155 on dental care which caused me to have to spend more money on an upgrade and etc. What bothers me is that TT assumes I need their help with decisions I can freely make on my own. And I don't recall being asked if I wish to have them keep me informed of "issues" with "ObamaCare". I suspect next will be a political appeal and etc. I see there are plenty of purchased software complaints. I did not purchase; I used the online version and got a refund. I took the "survey" which asked a lot of questions so I may be categorized for some future solicitations I'm sure. In summary the fault, in my view, is in the whole idea of filing over the internet. What guarantee is there of identity and account theft for instance? However, I have enough to do and didn't wish to spend a lot of time on paying taxes on my less than $100k salary. It worked this time. I will wait and see if there are consequences in the future.
I bought TurboTax software and it was easy to file my tax return. However, when prompted me to e-file software, it forced me to pay fees of $19.99 and $29.99. It is time consuming to be with customer service. They are unprofessional and have no manners. The rep told me to contact Santa Barbara Trust Bank to contact them to get my refund. However, they said they are a third party dealing with TurboTax collecting money for them. And in order for them to return the fees, they should get incident report from TurboTax. When I called TurboTax, they always hang up or act that they cannot hear me. I advise everyone not to deal with them; they are thieves.
I waded through all of TurboTax many vaguely veiled demands to upgrade to their paying service, despite the fact my filing was incredibly simple. I finished filing pretty quickly despite that and got my refund (direct deposit) in a reasonable timeframe. My problem comes in the fact that from the day of filing onwards. My email has been swamped with spam. I didn't sign up for anything else around the same period of time but from day zero of filing, I've seen between 7-15 spam messages a day. Thank God, Gmail has a decent filter. I don't know if Intuit sells everyone's email address or it was because I wouldn't buy anything from them but caveat emptor.
I've used TurboTax the past years with no problem. This year, I'm so beyond upset. I've tired literally everything that they asked me to. Nothing has worked! Each time I call, I wait for over an hour or they connect me with someone else that may know what to do. The same question comes up when I'm about to e-file, which now it's been over a week! I'm at my wit's end! Never again will I ever use them again! At least if I go to H&R Block, I know I will get my taxes done on that day!
I entered union dues twice. If I had been able to compare 2013 with 2012 (as I could do in prior years), I would have caught that error. As it was, I was forced to do an amendment since the return had been submitted & accepted. I also hate that it forces you to complete a state return even if you have no intention of buying that product before the return is finished.
I have used Turbo Tax for 10 years and I will never use it again. I bought the deluxe CD and installed it. I went through all the pages, income & deductions and because I do not want to e-file, it will not print a copy of the federal & state forms. I have spent hours looking for a way to print. I tried the help portion and find that no one is helping anyone with their questions. Never again will I use Turbo Tax!
I tried to get an answer from Intuit. After chatting with one rep, I was put back in a queue. It had 4 people waiting and told me to expect a wait of a minute. After more than 2 hours, there were still 3 waiting. I was still expecting a minute wait and then it disconnected. No other forms of communication were offered.
Their website is linked from the IRS free file website. They prequalify for free file - they lead you to believe it's free for both federal and state filing - then have you 1) register and create an account, 2) enter in all of your personal and financial information, and then 3) won't allow you to file unless you pay a fee or contact them so they can waive the fee (or try to upsell you). This is very deceptive and I can't believe this is allowed and linked to a .gov site. To add insult to injury, after you cancel out (so you don't lose part of your refund to Intuit fees) and you do all the work over again on a truly free basis, they have the gall to continually pester you with the contact information you provided them under the premise that filing with them was free! And contacting their support team (if you can get them) is an exercise in futility. A complete waste of time and energy. Absolutely horrible experience!
I discovered a bug in that the entire basis in our IRAs on form 8606T line 20 was transferred to Schedule A worksheet line 15 as a loss (loss incurred from total distribution of all IRAs). This gave me a terrific refund, but I wasn't sure the IRS would go for it once they figured it out. I spent 2 hours waiting for a representative who connected to my PC but wasn't able to help except to tell me to zero it out in Schedule A worksheet. When I tried to e-file, Turbo Tax wouldn't allow the override. I wasn't itemizing deductions, but I couldn't delete Schedule A or form 8606T. I finally put in a negative number on Schedule A which totally offset the ersatz loss. Everything else about Turbo Tax is great (or at least I didn't notice any apparent errors). I don't want to start all over next year with a different tax package, but Turbo Tax scares me. I tried to get TT support, but it was getting too complicated, and I felt my solution wouldn't raise any red flags, so I gave up trying to get help from Intuit.
I've used Turbo Tax for several years, but I think this will be the last time. Every screen was a new adventure in locking up, freezing up and rebooting. Thank goodness I would save as often as possible. What should have been a 2-hour (at most) project became a 4-hour nightmare. I can't even e-file as it keeps booting me out. Sorry Turbo Tax, but you've lost a longtime customer.
I found out the error on my federal return cited by Turbo Tax was false. Turbo Tax is ripping people off with their electronic filing. Just save return and file directly with agencies.
I have used TurboTax premier for about 10 years and was satisfied until filing my 2012 taxes. I purchased a CD version and loaded it onto my iMac with no problems. Data was entered and when I attempted to file my return electronically, I received a message that software updates were needed. Unfortunately, the updates did not load. This is where the more serious issues begin. Accessing a TurboTax rep was extremely difficult. After waiting over 40 minutes, I finally spoke with a rep who spent over an hour going through a series of attempts to correct the problem. They were unable to correct the issue and they issued an online download of TurboTax. I reentered my data and tried to file electronically but this failed. I contacted another rep at TurboTax after another 40-minute delay and spent another hour trying to diagnose and remedy the problem. This rep gave me another downloaded version of TurboTax Premier and instructed me on transferring data to the new software. The rep stayed with me until I successfully transmitted my federal and state returns. In summary, the products sold by TurboTax were defective (x2) and access to their support staff is horrible. Fortunately, one of their reps knew what she was doing. Next year, I will try another tax program.
I've used TurboTax for 5 years and this 2012 version is the first time I've had a problem, and wow, is it a problem. My other income is doubled causing an amount owed instead of a refund. I keep going to the section to correct the problem and it will not correct. I've searched for answers in TT, found only one help, and the instructions do not work with the 2012 version of TT. TurboTax doesn't give you a phone number to call them. I never knew that before now. I have no idea how I'm going to straighten out the problem other than delete everything and start over or go to a CPA to get my taxes done! Hey TT, I hope you are reading these reviews. I will not waste my money and time on your product next year.
I have used TT for over 10 years. Recently, each year is worse than the year before. This year I have a very simple question on filing extension electronically. First I used the chat. Obviously, the staff was chatting with many others and got confused and so I was given other people's answers. The staff was not well-trained, confused about online version and desktop version, yet insisting I had to go to an item on a menu that my version does not have. The staff thought the browser I was using was giving me problem. Finally she hung up the chat on me, so I decided I should call instead of chat. Well for the next 3+ hours on the phone, she even hung up on me because it is very frustrating to have staff from the same company give me different answers. One said yes, but can't show me how. The other said no. The one who said yes, but can't show me how, hung up on me. She happened to be a supervisor. For whatever reason, the staff always think my browser is the issue. I tried to explain, to no avail, that I am using a desktop version and not a browser. So many people file tax extensions. Why can't TT allow extension to be filed electronically for the desktop version? If using online version, why can't TT allow the already completed 4868 on desktop version be uploaded to online for filing? I could have easily printed the form 4868 and mail it in via post office and could have saved me 3+ hours of frustration. Unfortunately, my printer broke. That cost me 3+ hours on the phone with TT and so much frustration. However, I learned from this incident that I will not want to use TT again in the future. Especially the 2012 desktop. TT is too cute with so many pictures of real people popup, staring at my face in the desktop version. I find it to be distasteful, unprofessional and unnecessary.
It does not allow you to deduct the cost to file from your return. It charges over $30.00 to file your "Free eFile Return" only after you finish it and attempt to send it. Apple should allow negative star ratings, as this app deserves one. Boo! Hiss! Go to a real person; whatever they charge, including a CPA can be deducted from your tax bill! It is totally worth it to be taken care of by a human. And Apple will not even let me submit this bad review; it only allows good reviews. I guess they paid Apple a good chunk of change for that feature. Change the name to TurdbowlTax as it is **!
I have used TT for 2 years including the online free version last year and tried this year. The screen would freeze. Each time I could enter more information, it froze quicker and longer. So I purchased the Basic for $29.99 and completed it with little trouble. Then I purchased the $39.99 VA state with $19.99 e-filing fee. The computations were inaccurate and refund was $1589 less than stated. When I finally got a customer service person on the phone, she said the online problem was my browser - it's not! And I should not have expected a free VA - I never suggested that I expected a free VA, but she would not be quiet long enough to listen and said if the VA was wrong, it was my fault. The software does not move state information over. At that point I said that I would never use TT again and hung up. A few moments later, she called back to yell at me. No, really! That's it for TT.
I live in Missouri and I am self-employed. When I enter the Kansas City tax, it disappears from the category. Each individual at Turbo Tax (3) spoken with acknowledges the problem. They have stated they don't have a fix for the problem but don't offer a refund. If you pay a local tax and it is not shown on a W-2, avoid this product.
I had everything on my return done but then received an updated 1099 for my investments. So I went to the edit screen and deleted the old and redid it. I am not sure if this caused the problem, but when I went to generate a pdf to review, I noticed my interest income was much higher than previously. At first I thought it was because of the updated 1099, but when I looked at the printed copy, the interest items had duplicated themselves. When I went back to the entry screen, it displayed the list of items correctly but the total was doubled. So I deleted the entries that had duplicated and now the total is correct but the entries are not visible. I was told to use a downloaded version and not the on-line version. I will try this tonight. Very nervous about other hidden errors and will be doing a full manual review. Chat person was helpful but not able to solve problem and suggested the download.
I have been on Intuit's online chat for 4 hours. One "chatter" actually asked me if I was online with a tax question! That response was my first sign. Every time they "transfer" me to the Working on My Returns chat line, I get disconnected. As others before me have stated, I used TT for the last 5 years with no problem. This year, they made an error on my state taxes so I now owe more money. Where are the regulators that allow a company to market a "satisfaction guarantee" when there is no way to talk to a person? I will absolutely look for a new product next year and spread the word to others to absolutely not buy TT.
Even though we do not own a business, TT keeps reporting a $1 business profit and keeps demanding a business name and EIN number. I have redone the forms multiple times and it keeps changing it back to $1. It is also printing additional forms and schedules we do not need because we do not own a business! I have used TT for years without a problem, but I will never use it again.
I've used TurboTax for 10 years. Never had a problem until 2012 program. They now make you pay prior to viewing your return or checking for errors. I paid and in the checking process got an error message on scripts problem. I rebooted and tried Explorer, Chrome, and Firefox with same result. I tried on another computer in different location with same result. So now I've been ripped off for $49.99 unable to e-file or file by mail. It was a wonderful product but now has released this version too quickly and it's full of errors. So sorry to see TurboTax go; I will be using something else in the future.
I've been using TT for years and this is the first time I've had a problem. I've been waiting for 3 days for a phone call and/or email from them regarding a glitch in their system. My disability income was also added to my wages, tips, salary so it shows my income is double what it actually is. I've deleted and re-entered my info twice and still end up with the same error. I went to their online community for support, and I'm not the only person this has happened to. Why would there be absolutely no one to talk to?! There is no phone number to call?! My next contact with them will be to ask for a refund for the cost of their software.
I'm unable to prepare a second return and unable to get any help via the website and no phone number is provided anywhere. Absolutely no customer service.
There are many errors and bugs which remain unfixed for months. The error check gives message, "Mortgage int. must be linked to worksheet." You can't double click to link as it indicates, and in response to complaints, they acknowledge the problem and give two solutions to fix. Neither work. I have re-imported, deleted, re-entered, and I still get that message. The 1099MISC doesn't fit any of their choices and completing it leads to an endless loop. There is an error in the instructions for rental below market rate. One TT support said, "Ignore the instructions." The next one said to follow instructions. One leaves you hanging and the other another endless loop. The support is non-existent. It's at least one hour or more for online chat or phone, and limited hours. You can't preview or print selected forms unless you pay first. You can't jump to a certain form. They are charging me $774 for business tax and I don't even have a business! They said to delete Schedule C, which I did, but that charge still is in there. At this point, after 3 weeks, I can't complete my return because of errors and can't get help on how to fix it. This will be the last time I use this product and, in fact, I may have to switch this year in order to file. I have already had to delete the entire return and start over because all my 2011 comparison data just disappeared. I would advise no one to use these products, especially if you itemize or have rental income.
We needed to file amended federal and state income tax returns in order to add a late 1099 DIV for $100. This should increase federal tax by $15 and our state tax by $7 or $8. The amendment to the federal return is OK, but the amended state return now shows that we owe $666 more (for only $100 in additional dividend income). The $666 is $8 more than the amount that our refund should be. In a "Bottom Line" summary page, TurboTax shows the correct result, but the actual return is wrong.
I found a problem with my 2012 Federal tax return concerning my HSA and medical expenses. Following a detailed discussion with the IRS (who were very helpful), it seemed to be a software issue with TurboTax. Customer service at TurboTax were most unhelpful, insisting that I must have wrongly encoded my data; and that if there was a problem with the software program, then someone else would have discovered it previously. Eventually, I got to talk to one of their independent consulting accountants who agreed with me about the problem and said that he would pass on the information. I can correct the problem on my own taxes this year by falsely manipulating the data to fool the program, but this does not help anyone else. Now, all I have received from TurboTax is an email saying my problem is solved. Despite the fact that my call to them was mainly to alert them to the problem, which I believe affects many of their customers, they seem disinterested. It is, of course, impossible to find anyone to talk to at Intuit.
I've been using and recommending TT to people for more years than I can count. This year has been a disaster. I sat down to file and after updating the disk I installed, I now get messages that some of the forms are missing and won't be updated until 1-19-13. OK, but it's now March 16th! Where and why won't TT update the forms? That was the first problem I ran across. After going through the process, I was told by TT that I don't even qualify for the home deduction even though I meet all the requirements and have taken a home office deduction for the past 15 years! Can't find anything on this either online or in chat, except who qualifies for it - which should be me! I got to online chat and waited 10 minutes, only to be told I need to talk to someone else. Now I'm in the queue for a whopping 83 hold? There are so many tax forms missing in this software. How in the heck is TT even going to ensure you're getting all the deductions if you can't fill out the forms required or go through the step by painful step of answering the questions? I usually have my taxes done in about 2 to 3 hours. I've been sitting here all day now for what should be a pretty cut and dry routine procedure since nothing but my income has changed over the last year. TT take a hike. I'm sorry I wasted the money and will now have to go outside to have someone responsible do my taxes or purchase H&R software and start all over again. Glad I didn't wait until the 11th hour, although with these issues it will be months before I even see a refund now. That is if I qualify because according to TT, I owe big time which is absurd. My income only went up about 20% from previous years, yet my tax liability went up by 350%! Impossible!
I've been using Turbo Tax for years but as they get bigger, they are lost! Specific forms for business were out last year, so I had to make some phone calls and spend too many hours on the phone. This year the form is available but now, they have a problem with expenses! I caught a mistake and tried to eliminate it, but then I didn't even get the expense at all? This is really making me angry. They don't know business! Who's in charge? Since they don't know business, then how can they support business taxes? Duh! I'm done this year and only because I actually paid for their stupid headache for tax preparation. I recommend www.irs.gov and use their supporting programs like Tax Act or H&R or anybody else! Good luck to all.
I filed our Federal and State income taxes online on Feb. 2, 2012 using TurboTax. I had no problems e-filing our Federal return and we received our Federal refund within a week. Our State e-file was another matter. TurboTax froze up on me after I agreed to pay the $20 fee to e-file my Arkansas state return. Eventually (after three computer restarts), I finally got it to file. The next day, I received confirmation that my state taxes were received by the state, so I mailed off the form required by the Arkansas Dept. of Finance and Admin. So far, so good, so I thought. The problem is that it is now March 16 and we still haven't received our refund! I've tried to contact TurboTax a couple of times, but always have to hold for over 45 minutes, so I just gave up. At this point, I am in the process of trying to determine whether my state ever even received our return and whether I need to re-file. I have been using TurboTax since 1990 but will never buy/use it again nor would I ever recommend it to anyone!
I paid for the software. I tried to call for support and waited for 45 minutes. Someone answered the phone then put me to different department. I was on hold 120 minutes. The person couldn't answer the question, need transfer to other department. Another 175 minutes, still no one picked up the phone. It is impossible to contact someone via phone. I have been on hold for 3 hours and 20 minutes now. Since I've been waiting for so long, I don't want to lose it there for I can't go to lunch or the restroom. I strongly advise against using TurboTax and will tell my peers not to use it. Their customer service is unacceptable. All they need is your money and no support.
I can’t believe I used this program! After filing on Feb 19th, I received an email stating that my return had been accepted by the IRS. I then received another email stating I would receive my return on Mar 12. When that didn't happen, I referred back to the email (which apologized for the delay, and told me to expect a letter from the IRS), which in fact, I received today. Now I am on hold with the IRS and have been for 48 minutes. Who knows what the heck is going on? I'm pretty confident that Intuit expected these problems and delays, which warranted the next step (to wait for a letter from the IRS) if my return had not been received by the specified date. This program is a joke and I regret having purchased it. I do not recommend this to anyone. If I make it through this process with my sanity and minimal financial damage, I will be grateful. This has truly been a learning experience. H&R Block, you have my business for 2013! Frustrated in Texas.
I am completely dissatisfied with my use of TurboTax and I completely regret using it. I would rather file a paper return and I would go back if I could. I have completed all the steps and the very last page where I hit submit return button, there is a glitch not allowing me to do so. Had I not already paid $20 to file, I would abandon this process. But now they have me completely committed. There is no way to contact them. There is a 30-minute wait to chat with someone online and the page keeps on timing out causing me to have to repeat the 30 minutes. It is impossible to contact someone via phone. I have been on hold for 15 minutes now. I strongly advise against using TurboTax and will tell my peers not to use it. Their customer service is unacceptable.
Someone in TT or Intuit development dropped the ball! No live person to help. The program is difficult (impossible for me this year) to install, and I cannot update the forms despite email from them informing they are available. I cannot print without Do Not File showing across the form. I have spent hours attempting to get a response to questions with no success. I'm going to H & R Block where there are live people to help.
After I downloaded some updates to TurboTax around 2/20/13, I've not been able to access my nearly completed filings for 2012. I've been using TurboTax since 2003, buying the home and business CD every year. This year, after reading issues on the web and trying all fixes and 10 hours later, I decided to give TurboTax a try. First two calls to TurboTax, my home phone died from loss of battery (over 30 minutes on hold). The third time, I spent nearly 2 hours on the line trying everything I did over the weekend with no fix. I was told to use another PC and try to import the return files there and maybe it will work. Today, I'll purchase tax software that will pull in 2011 TurboTax files. I will not use or recommend TurboTax anymore.
Return was rejected twice because of TT error in for 502UP. I have tried manual override, but TT program keeps reverting to its error (line 12 supposed to have 4 decimal places, but program keeps printing it as four digits, two decimals). I've had to print forms and make manual calculations for manual filing. Because I've already authorized automatic withdrawal of outstanding taxes, I am in limbo as to whether I have to make another payment. I'm not happy. To be fair, I have used TT for years, with no problems - and I have had 2012 return accepted for two other states as well as federal. But this error has me very nervous, whether it will create an "audit chain reaction" or not. There are many complaints about MD 2012 program on the TT website but no answers from TT.
I have used TurboTax for 8+ years. We filed on the 23rd of February and received an email that stated "return filed successfully". On the 24th, we received an email stating that TurboTax encountered a problem with our e-file and would file State and Federal again on February 28th. We called on the 27th just to make sure our returns were going to be e-filed. After being on hold for 2 hours and 17minutes and speaking to two customer service representatives, we were assured that it was going to be taken care of. On March 1st, because we received no email message that stated if it had been e-filed, I called again (37 minutes on hold) and was told the Federal had been filed and the State was still on TurboTax's server; but it would be e-filed in the next cycle. The customer service representative explained that it was a random rejection by our state, and I explained that we filed ours and my sister's the same day. They have the exact same schedules; theirs have been accepted and ours is pending. On the 2nd, we called again (1 hour and 12 minutes on hold) to check on State. I spoke to Jennifer and was told that it was still not e-filed; both are still shown as pending on their site. I cannot get information from TurboTax. I went onto TurboTax’s support online only to find that there are hundreds of negative remarks about this same issue and no one is getting any help. Our state return is still sitting on their server and it has been paid to be e-filed. TurboTax has that money and no e-file! Right now, we are unsure of what to do. After the lack of help and not knowing where our personal information is, for sure, next year, going to use something else.
The Department of Revenue in the State of Indiana tells me e-filing should be completed in 2 weeks and mail filing in 12 weeks, yet I cannot determine if Turbo-tax has even filed my tax return. Both my federal and state were e-filed through TurboTax on January 26th, but the state states it hasn't been processed. In five weeks, they commonly do better than that, and there was only one item changed from last year’s filing! Nowhere in the TurboTax program does it state that there is a determination point of state acceptance! The authorization to deduct $19.99 as payment for state e-filing should have resulted in a $316 return!
Because of the consequences of this unresolved problem, I will either need to file by mail or take my return to H&R. Each time, after I entered my credit card information to e-file my federal return, my screen goes blank, and I have to re-launch TurboTax Deluxe. After several tries over two days and rebooting etc., I called for help. The customer service person (uncertain of country location) told me I wasn't the only one with this problem. He tried many ways to fix it and none worked; that took one hour and 40 minutes. He gave up and told me I'd get a refund. The follow-up email said my case # was closed and there was no mention of a refund. I filled out the online survey and received a promise of a Visa credit. I have used TurboTax for 12 years without any significant problem.
I tried the chat version and phone support. The chat was especially awful. Wrong answers then the agent just quit. The next agent (04_Sheryl **) was especially off target, saying "Try changing web browsers" for example, although the previous and later agents could tell from the supplied information that I had desktop software. Most of what she said had no relationship to my issue and seemed to be just random suggestions. There was also a long delay before she sent anything. The chat window took 33 minutes before connecting to an agent, making a pop sound every few seconds. It was an additional 30 minutes getting wrong information that had no hope of fixing my issue. After an especially long wait for a reply, I said, "I'm gathering data for how awful the customer support is for TurboTax." Usually, agents just hang up. Is that what you are going to do? None of your suggestions has been even remotely related to my problem. Well, instead of disconnecting, she said I needed tax advice (not true) and transferred me to a CPA. Who knew that Intuit would offer tax advice? Well, this was the pleasant surprise payoff from this effort. Although he wasn't personally familiar with the nuts and bolts of the software, he was able to consult with someone who gave him the right place to find the information to delete. While all this waiting was going on, I was also on hold to talk to someone on the phone, which was a far better experience. (However, the music on hold was so distorted and garbled I wish they would have just left the line silent.) After waiting 21 minutes on the phone, I heard ringing tone as if being connected to someone but they disconnected. I called back and waited only 5 minutes to speak with Rose. She fixed the problem in less than a minute. The TurboTax forms sometimes let you click on an entry and it goes to the source form. With Form 8949, that is not available but you can view the data source. The problem is that the source of the imported data is not listed. It turns out that you cannot change the imported data from the forms view, only from the step-by-step view. So the data source information is missing crucial information. This is what worked: Step-by-step and Federal Taxes and Wages & Income and explore on my own and Import Summary or Investment Income.
As others have noted, this year (2012 IT) has been a nightmare for filers and I am on the list. I also received a delay of acceptance message last Tuesday (10 days ago) and was told by an Intuit representative that the IRS is to blame since they are the holdup. From what I see on this site, the experience is widespread and I have no recourse but to wait, or do I? Advertisements on TV for H&R Block say they will review TurboTax returns for free and refile if necessary. I'm not sure if there's a refile charge but, after next Tuesday, if my 2012 return is not accepted, I intend to take them up on the offer.
My return was calculated wrong, even though TurboTax documented it was correct and that the State accepted my submission. After review, the numbers were wrong, affecting my refund. TurboTax refused to accommodate my request for simply the refunding of the cost of the single state filing… all of $37. If their math is wrong, and it doesn’t check my work, the submission is at risk for problems. And they do not care. And as a result, if they don’t double check my work, why do I need them? I cannot check my work without them. They claim they will ensure accuracy but do not and do not care about me. So they got $37 from me this time but never again. And anyone that I can warn in person, on line and in print, I will. (And owned by Intuit?) I will advise any and every one I come in contact with that the entire product line from Intuit is flawed and they do not stand behind their product or their customers. Run, don’t walk to another service!
Like many, I've never had a problem with them until this year. I understand the education credit delay, but then they added a form for a passive activity loss on a house we no longer own! I even checked the box that we no longer own the house. This has put us in perpetual pending status with no end in sight. I chatted with them and was told, “Too bad, so sad. Nothing we can do.” I've heard of others re-filing with another company, but I'm mad because I can't afford to let it be held up by being rejected. What a horrible experience.
I was charged on my Discover for TurboTax and the figures were wrong. Now I have to refile and get an independent to prepare my federal and state taxes and yet I paid for TurboTax.
I filed federal and state returns on 10 Feb. 13 through TT. The federal return is still "pending" in TT but the IRS website shows no record of my return after 18 days. I've called TT three times, attempted to chat twice, but have no positive results. I called the IRS, who indicated they had no record of my return and that I should consider other tax software. I will most definitely do so with my 2013 taxes!
I have done Turbo Tax other years with no problem. I got a "free CD" this year & took it with on snowbird vacation along with the prior year return. Before I could take one step, it charged me $59.99 when local ads that weekend had it for $49.99. It says we have high deductible health plan though we don't and can't find where to report roll over of my retirement from a recent job to my IRA. On an accuracy check, it says that I'm good to submit despite flagging things that don't make sense & I've left blank. Then it says I can't e-file due to my "tax situation". Nothing unusual happened this year. I think I should get my money back so I can go to H&R Block. This is really making me mad. I want to be done with it. What a headache! Online support says it's a "glitch." So, we have to pay for their problem?
I gave a review a few hours ago with complaints that were corrected. My refund was received with no extra deductions other than the fee.
I've used Quicken and TurboTax for ~12 years. I've never had a problem with TurboTax until this year. I have one minor gripe on the new flow; you are forced to repeatedly answer that you don't want to use the advisor and you want to enter manually. But, that's a minor gripe. TT took my return and took my money three weeks ago. They didn't say they couldn't process the Federal return at the time. However, it is now Feb. 27th and they say they are waiting on a form (which isn't part of my IRS package) that was released on the Feb. 14th. If you go to the chat, the agents don't answer. I've been assigned 11_Genisha ** and she hasn't responded to the chat window as I type up this complaint. I've opened a 2nd chat window and now I'm still waiting ~15 minutes later. Next year, H&R Block.
I received an email that state returns are not accepted after midnight in January 2013. Another message sent next day stating that was a mistake. Still states on their website that my return was not accepted. I tried fixing it four times. Today the IRS was to deposit my refund. I received an email from Intuit at 4AM that my refund is being diverted to them first to deduct fees and then sent to my bank in 1 or 2 days. I was not told of this. I can't believe it's legal. Why not deduct from my bank account? So my refund is delayed longer and who knows how much will be deducted, and I'm paying for a rejected state return. Also, customer service is unreachable.
I bought and downloaded the most expensive version of Turbo Tax to do the taxes for my S Corp. When I was checking out, it offered me a version of Quicken at a reduced price. I tried to buy it, but the link only let me know more about the offer. There was no way to actually purchase. Later, I was entering information for my shareholders and there was no box to enter % owned. Turbo Tax asked me why I hadn't entered a % and directed me back to the shareholder page, but there was nowhere to put the figures in. Later, when reviewing my K-1s, I found that I could scroll through and change it manually, which is a huge hassle. But hey, at least it works. Then I paid an extra $50 to get the state version of my tax return filed, only to find that Arizona doesn't e-file. I don't know what I bought. I don't know why I would have to buy anything more after the $150 I spent on the poorly functioning product. Then I went back to the website to try and buy Quicken, just because I thought it would be a nice tool for my business. No such luck. At one of my home pages, I can get to three different home pages, all of which ask me to log in and try to sell me products I already own. There's a prominent link letting me know what a great deal I can get on Quicken. Clicking it gives me a popup message about what a great deal I can get and nothing else. I can't buy it. So I tried for live support. I typed a description of my problem and submit. A phone number pops up on the bottom with a "less than 5 minute" wait time. 26 minutes later, I'm still on hold with some god awful flute solo that's just blaring in the background. I search for topics like mine on their community site and find dozens of them all saying the same thing - this doesn't work; no one will talk to me in any form; I don't know what to do. Awesome. I'd love to demand my money back, but I know I've got literally no shot.
I have used TT for years without issue and this year has been pretty bad. To be fair, I did all 3 of our children’s taxes successfully. Their refunds are still pending but the returns were accepted. My wife’s and mine have been stuck in efile since at least Feb 9th. All it will say is to check back in 24 hours. They say there are forms the IRS will not process yet, but I went through the list of forms and none of them were a part of my return. There is either a software problem going on or else there is a communication problem. Either way, they seem to have a lot of regular past customers who are very unhappy with them this year, myself included.
The error checker keeps saying, "Schedule B: Payer name exempt-int div- must be entered." When you enter 0, it won't accept that. You can't correct it in the error check screen. There is a glitch in the software and when I called customer service, they said it would be corrected on 2/7/13. It is now 2/27/13 and nothing is changed, except you can't get a hold of anyone in customer service to address the issue. I am done with TurboTax.
I have used this service for years and never had a problem. I started noticing that the more deductions I recorded for my business, the lower my refund was going. I was also unable to enter deductions for the business use of my home. This started me searching reviews of TT. Guess I'm not the only one. I think I may go the old fashioned pen and paper route. This rates only one star (or less), but I'm not angry. Just glad I stopped before getting in too deep.
I did my daughter's taxes on the TurboTax software that I purchased last year and could not get them electronically filed. They were rejected multiple times because it said her birth date was different from what was on file with the IRS. The exact same thing happened this year after I paid $20 to file the state taxes electronically. I have to mail the tax forms in now and TurboTax does not refund state filing fees regardless if your electronic return is accepted or not! What a horrible business practice! Buyer, beware with this software!
I have used TurboTax every year since 1990 with no problems until this year. This year, however, TurboTax delayed my filing for two weeks stating that certain forms were not ready (they didn't identify which forms). When I was finally able to submit the forms, I received notice that it would take 24 to 48 hours to process my return. I then received notice that my return was pending. That was over two weeks ago, and it is still pending. The TurboTax support people blame the IRS, and the IRS blames TurboTax. Neither one is willing to take action to fix the problem. I have given up on TurboTax e-File and will submit my tax return by regular mail. As a result, my refund may be delayed by months. Given TurboTax's e-File problems this year, I advise anyone who hasn't yet submitted their tax return to purchase a different software product or file their return by regular mail. Do the same and do not try e-File with TurboTax. If you really want your refund back soon, purchase a different tax preparing software.
I am not sure what they did but they sent me a message saying I owed them money because the IRS had adjusted my return and there was not enough money left to pay them. I called IRS and TT had left out forms that should have been filed and triggered an audit on me. They have to be the worst. The IRS lady said they have had more audits this year because of TT mistakes than they have had in the past 6 years.
I've used TurboTax for 10 years, but this will be the last. I submitted my taxes on January 10th. I did hear, after the fact, that the IRS wouldn't be processing until January 30th. Then I heard that some form I used was going to cause more of a delay. None of this was told to me before I pressed the button and launched my return into nowhere land. My returns just hung out there in pending mode. Then on Feb. 10th, the federal updated to "accepted" and I received my refund on Feb. 20th. Meanwhile, my state return is still hanging out there in pending mode - three weeks after the feds started accepting returns. TT's website states that "You will be notified in 24-48 hours whether your return is accepted or rejected." I contacted TT and they were really jerky about it. They blamed the state and made me feel like an idiot because I should know that TT wouldn't be able to discuss my taxes with a taxing authority, only I can do that. Duh! The problem is my state keeps telling me that there is nothing to discuss. They have never received the return. So where is my return?! No one seems to have it. This is unacceptable. I would understand if there was some update that let us know what was happening or what the hold up was. Instead, they just keep us in the dark and push the blame off on other parties. Very bad customer service. Not using them again!
2012 Turbo Tax Filing - I have used TurboTax for years without any problems whatsoever. This year has been a nightmare. I filed my taxes on 1/10/13. TurboTax held it because the IRS wasn't processing returns until 1/30/13, but then before 1/30/13, I got an email saying it was accepted early. Nothing has happened since. I did have education credits, so I was waiting until after 2/14 when the IRS began to process those returns. Today, it’s already 2/22/13, and I've been checking my refund for a week. The IRS still doesn't have anything for me. Now, what do I do? I am so frustrated with TurboTax! I will not be using them again.
I used TurboTax 6 years ago and then went to another company. I tried them again this year 2012. I filed my taxes with direct deposit. Entered my new account information and their system overrode it with the old account information. Bottom line, refunds were not deposited and I'm still waiting for a paper check in the mail. I cannot speak with a live person and no responses to my online requests. But I was charged an extra $20 because they had to write a paper check. I will never ever use TurboTax again!
I chose Turbo Tax this year because I had no problem with them last year. They seemed to be very reliable and helpful with all of my needs. I filled out my tax return much like last year with no problems. I filed my return on the 24th of January. I assumed that there were no problems. The IRS was to blame for my education credit form that was not available to file until the middle of February. My wife checked our debit card that we received from them last year. A week ago, there was no problem with the card; it was active. She called in today and it was deactivated. They told my wife that we received a notice in the mail as well as in our email. There was no notice sent to us in either form. The whole point of filing with Turbo Tax was the ease of receiving my refund on the same debit card that we already owned. They decided to deactivate our card and opt us for a check instead without our approval. Or, we could file for “their” NetSpend card, which has been known to have multiple problems so far with their presently unhappy customers. They told me that my address was also different since we moved from our past location. I now need to call the IRS to change my address and send the refund to a different card or opt for a check. We are going to try to change it to one of our bank accounts and hopefully there will be no problems in doing this with the IRS. I know that it takes almost an hour or longer to get a hold of an actual representative. A check will take a couple extra weeks and I am not willing to wait that long. There should have been some notification of this before I filed with them. I would have just filed the taxes myself if I knew they were going to do this to me and delay this process? Like I stated earlier, the whole point of filing with them was the ease of the process. This has become somewhat of a nightmare. My wife is talking to our lawyer from our business' Pre-Paid Legal to see what legal ramifications we could find from this. I want to receive the money that I paid for filing my taxes with them and I would like a serious apology and an explanation from a district manager or someone higher up through Turbo Tax. BTW they do not accept complaints from the Better Business Bureau. Any complaints will be rejected within a few hours, so do not waste your time. Good luck. Turbo Tax can close your bank card account with no notice and leave you high and dry waiting for a paper check in the mail.
This was my second year using the purchased online version of TurboTax. Last year, we were attracted by the free federal version, knowing there would be a $39.95 charge for our California e-filing. Because we no longer claim deductions, we thought the free e-z form would suffice. However, somewhere along the way, it upgraded us to the Deluxe version without ever making us aware of it, and charged us for the federal and state. Although we were never given an explanation, I now assume it was because of the added form for interest and dividends exceeding $1,500. When I called their support line (they make you jump through hoops to get the number) after an hour's wait, I talked to a woman who was very helpful, respectful and solved the problem. She never did say why I was upgraded, but gave me a service code number and talked me through how to enter it. To my surprise, once I entered it, the new amount showed federal 0 and the state also 0. I wasn't looking for free gifts, but was obviously pleased, thanked her, and decided I would use TurboTax again. So this year, I went online, registered in with them and very carefully and deliberately chose Deluxe version for $29.95, plus the state for $39.95, because we still no longer itemize deductions, but do need the forms to report interest, dividends and social security. Along every step of the way, because of what happened last year, I was extremely vigilant for any notices or changes. Because TurboTax saves your previous year's numbers, shows them alongside your new entries, it was simple and familiar. However, when I reached the final stage, basically the checkout, it was now charging me for the Premiere version at $49.95 plus the state at $39.95. I was livid! In going back over my version choice and all entries, nothing I could do would change it. So I once again called their support line. After about an hour's wait (every 5-10 minutes it would say "Your wait time will be 1 minute"), I obviously reached India. The gentleman was polite but in giving me a service code number to correct it to the right price, he did not know where I should enter it. Also, after all the deliberate care I took in choosing versions and monitoring for any changes, I didn't appreciate it when he said, "You must have made a mistake." So I don't know if I will use TurboTax again next year. I like the format and ease of entry, but when it comes to their charging procedures, bait-and-switch doesn't seem to apply. In bait-and-switch, you are shown one product, but talked into buying another. TurboTax doesn't talk to you, they just switch you. The more appropriate term might be scam. Are they playing the odds and assuming that most or even some people will not notice the change, or give up trying, and go ahead and pay just to get their taxes filed?
I have used the service for years with no issues. This year, it seems there is a glitch in their systems. As with my children, there is an option that states "Child's other parent will claim them this year per legal agreement." I checked this option. It removed my EIC and Child Tax credits and dropped my refund by a few thousand dollars. However, it seems on the final review section, it re-added my EIC, did not increase my refund and filed them this way. Now, their mother is unable to claim them on her return. I called TurboTax and was told wait time is one minute. Thirty minutes later, I got to talk to I think was a kid named Maria who I am surprised even knew what tax returns were, let alone what TurboTax was. All she could tell me was to amend my return. Okay, what am I supposed to do? Your commercial makes it very clear that you are the only tax company that will put me in contact with tax professionals, so what company do you work for? Calling back the next day, I waited for 10 minutes and was told the same thing: remove the kids and amend the return and it would take 5-6 weeks to amend that my fiancée cannot submit her tax until mine is amended. But I would have to wait for my initial refund to be deposited and I may even be subject to fines from IRS. What? I was then hung up on. I called back and hung up on again. I then waited for 30 minutes to demand a refund from TurboTax which I was told cannot happen since the funds were being taken from my refund. I called back once they take the funds and then they will mail me a check in 3-5 weeks. H&R Block is getting a copy of these screwed up tax returns and hopefully, they can help me sort this mess out. H&R got a new customer as of 2013.
Turbo Tax is broken. Can import a 1099 from financial institution. If imported from a second account at same institution, TTax overwrites the first import. Their answer? Enter manually. Like many others, I've used this product for many years. This will be the last year.
As all others have already noted, TurboTax is having severe issues with their software. It's time for them to be honest with their customers. Maybe a little exposure from the press and a little action by our elected officials could change their attitude.
I have used Intuit products - Quickbooks, Quicken and TurboTax for more than 10 years without a problem until this year. TT Premier should have a free state download. It saved the fed return and downloaded the state but would not complete the state. It wants me to purchase another state online with my CC. I use Quicken 2010 Property Manager that will not import without a .txf file, which is not available in that version of Quicken. Customer service is non-existent. I called TT (Intuit) and after a 45-minute wait, I was told the import issue was in Quicken and I would be transferred to that department. Another 20-minute wait for the computerized voice to tell me I can get personal service at their website, a joke. There were no phone numbers or information at Quicken.com. Intuit will not refund my purchase since I bought this from a retail source. The online retailer should not have to bear the refund cost for an Intuit defective product. I teach business classes and will no longer recommend an Intuit product to my clients.
I, too, have used TurboTax for at least 4 years, and without any problems. However, this year, I wish I went to an expert to have my taxes filed. There seems to be a system error in the program. I had all my itemizing and deductions in place. During the initial review, I realized that I made a user error so I went in to make the correction. By doing so, the program went haywire and froze for a few seconds. I did not think anything of it at the time being and thought that this happens once in a while when something is uploading on other programs; I gave the system time to adjust and re-format. Once the screen became operable again, I went ahead and double checked the area that I applied the changes to; everything looked fine. Moving forward, I went ahead and ran it through the TurboTax error check; it came back without any errors. Seeing how everything looked good, I e-filed both my federal and state tax, only to be rejected by the state. With that, I reluctantly had to revisit the forms. In doing so, I found that the correction was not saved, and it was submitted without the change, or so it looked like it! I called TurboTax, waited for 45 minutes, and then, when I did get connected, they explained that there was a high volume of callers, and that they would be transferring my call to another specialist. Lo and behold, I get disconnected. I called again, and the automated recording advises the high volume of callers and that the wait period would be between 30-45 minutes. This time, after waiting for 36 minutes, I got through and discussed the issue. The lady tells me that I will need to file an amendment and perhaps, request for an extension! By this time, I received an email notification advising that my federal return was accepted. I am not sure what actually went through and what was received. Right now, the information that TurboTax is displaying in regards to my returns is questionable as I do not know for certain what was actually sent. This is another reason to dislike filing taxes. This is my last year using TurboTax!
I have never had a bad experience with TurboTax until 2013. The deluxe program has flaws. It required me to file a form that is not needed (5695 Residential Energy). I contacted technical support, and they couldn't help. I was told to restart my return. I was also told that the IRS was not accepting returns requiring this that’s why I would have to wait. I waited until the 7th of February. I filed the taxes with pending response for the last week and a half. I called customer service for TurboTax and waited 41 minutes - no resolution was given. I waited for a supervisor for another 15 minutes; no response. I am contacting the FTC and Better Business Bureau. I feel there has been a breach of contract on their behalf and border-lining on fraud.
This is my second year using their services to file. I was not informed that the forms I needed were not available until after I filed. I was told my return would be held until January 30th. It was not filed until 01/22, and it was accepted on 01/26. I am still waiting on a return after seeing others with the same forms accepted and approved for a refund. I am under enough stress, and this is contributing.
I believe that this is an increasingly unfortunate problem. TurboTax uses a lot of foreign call centers. In this instance, I had a question about a 1099 filing. After waiting for 20 minutes, I spoke to someone presumably from India who said that the IRS prohibited her from giving tax advice. She transferred me to a number located within the US. I have been informed that it'll be another 40 minutes to talk to someone. Sounds to me that TurboTax doesn't know what they're doing.
I've used TurboTax for years with good results, but not this year. My Deluxe program (which I downloaded) does not open the Help Center, so I can get no answers to simple questions (like how to open a window to list expenses separately). I called, and after a 25-minute wait, was sent to another department. The same thing happened again - a 16-minute wait, and now a 50-minute wait for another department. Does anyone there (in India) know anything about this program?
I have never had a problem with TurboTax until 2013. I went to file my tax return online last night, 2/16/13, and noticed that the software did not record my 2012 itemized deductions. I contacted them via phone, 2/17/13 at 6:30 a.m. and spent 45 minutes waiting for a rep and then another two hours on the phone with a rep, trying to figure out what the problem is. It appears that they have a glitch with their software when it comes to itemized deductions. The rep then told me to download the software and file my taxes that way. Well, lo and behold, it is now 12:23 p.m. pacific standard time and no filed tax return. The download is a joke. I had to uninstall the crap. I am now off to H&R Block. And to think TurboTax had the nerve to poke fun at H&R Block.
I try to e-file. Rejected. Message: “There is a known problem with TurboTax that is being corrected. Please wait until February 22, 2013 and then...” Basically, update the software and go through the return from the beginning and try again. A three-hour call to support ended with me wanting to shoot myself. I resolved the issue myself because I am awesome, but an error message that says "wait six days and try again" is unacceptable.
I am so disappointed and feel I was cheated by TurboTax. We have used the software for several years and have always been satisfied with the results. I would have said the same thing about this year, except for all the add-on charges. Not only did we pay the $49 for the deluxe version, but then got added on charges for another $50. Today we received a paper check in the mail with a letter from a bank saying they deducted an additional $20 since our routing number was incorrect. We gave them the routing number our credit union gave us to use. So it cost us $120 for a simple tax return. Next year, we'll go to H&R Block and let them earn the fees.
I had a simple question regarding filing 2 W2's, one for NY and one for NJ. I paid the extra money for the tax experts, waited 22 minutes for a representative to pick up, and the lady that answered would respond with "um....", went mute for a few minutes, came back and said things like, "How was your day?" or "Where are you from?" I asked another question, to which I got the same treatment, 5 minutes of silence with "um’s” interspersed. I didn't receive an answer to this question. The answer I got for the second question was, "Well, you are reporting more wages, so you are being taxed more." Even the most uneducated knows "more wages" does not equal "less return." I had my taxes taken out of my paycheck every time. This was also incorrect because I did the same thing last year, and this year my return was abysmal, though I didn't do anything differently from last year. She then said she will "axe" (I assume she meant "ask") someone, went mute for a while, then returned and recommended I speak with a Tax Expert. I'm overjoyed at this, but keep reading. She transferred me, and I heard the "hold" music. After waiting for approximately 12 minutes, the line went "beep, beep, beep" and Turbo Tax hung up on me. When I tried to call back, I had to now wait an additional 20+ minutes on hold for the first level "Tax Expert." Terrible service, terrible knowledge of taxes, terrible all around. Avoid at all costs. I wish I could refund my entire evening as well as the money I paid for the blatant lie in the "expert" portion of "Tax Expert."
I've been using TurboTax for years with no problems. My federal and state tax returns were sent in early February. The federal seems to have processed without problems but the State did not get sent. I never received the acceptance email that is normally generated so I contacted my state today. They indicated that TurboTax has a transmission issue and it was never received. I even got an email from TurboTax indicating it was sent. I immediately contacted TurboTax and have heard nothing back from them! I paid the $19.99 fee to process my state taxes and now this. I will never use this product again.
I have used Turbo Tax for over 10 years. Up until about two years ago, I was happy with them. The last two years, however, the guide that helps you walk through the filing process has become very confusing. What is really bad is what happened this year. When I filed, I received notification that my return would not be accepted because my return included a form that was delayed and wouldn't be available until March. When I checked on the form in question, it isn't one I am required to file. Turbo Tax never asked me the exception questions that would have omitted this form. The Turbo Tax system required it because I had rental income, but I didn't meet the litmus test that required the form. Since I have already filed, I am now stuck waiting for my refund all because of this lousy product with no recourse.
I bought TurboTax Deluxe and e-filed both federal and state tax. About a week or so later, I went to check my e-filing status. Did turbo tax do an update? I checked e-filing status again. It said that neither the state nor federal tax were e-filed. They wanted a $19.99 for one state filing that should have been included in TurboTax Deluxe. They also wanted a $29.99 TurboTax refund processing fee for a direct deposit of the federal refund. I chatted with TurboTax, and they did not answer the question regarding the $29.99 TurboTax refund processing fee. Why would I pay another bank to process my refund from the IRS when it was being direct deposited? Also, the TurboTax support representative said that I should have called about the $19.99 state filing fee. I don't think the support person on the chat understood what I was typing.
I have used TurboTax for well over ten years. Every year, it gets more complicated and frustrating in its inability to explain what information is needed or why it calculates things differently when a law changes. This year, I used the business version because I started an LLC and wanted to deduct the related costs. The help section is very, very poor. No explanation of what information is needed for a given entry. Their expert advice directly conflicts with IRS publications which brings up the point of if I have to go to the IRS website to find information, what do I need TurboTax for? The idea behind software is to make something easier, not make the user do the work themselves. My main gripe this year, as I've stated it gets worse every year, is that finishing and filing my return got hung up because TurboTax did not ask for information or automatically fill out a form needed for my LLC. I had to dig through to find the problem and fill out the form myself before the software would complete the return. Isn't this what I paid them for?! Reading reviews, I find this same problem happens to others and it has been known for a few years. I used to kind of look forward to doing my taxes because of the mental challenges involved, a sense of accomplishment. TurboTax has become such a hindrance to the process. I doubt I'll ever use another Intuit product again. Poor product. Save your money and use anything else or use a tax service if you're unable or unwilling to do it yourself. I'm warning you to save you the aggravation of this ill piece of software.
I bought Business TurboTax. While filing, I was told I needed to spend $59 for NC state tax. I thought this was okay but after I finished, they told me they don't support NC. No refund. I've been on hold for 2 hours and when I am one caller away from customer service, I get cut off. Next year, I will not be using TurboTax. I used it 4 years running but they have lost me with poor service this year. I can do without the headache.
After finishing my federal return on Turbo Tax Deluxe, I was prompted to purchase the state download. In years past, this was always included with the purchase price of the Federal. I entered my credit card information as instructed on the screen and got a confirmation email, but I still cannot get the state download. It has now prompted me to a screen that stated that I must call Intuit Sales and Service to complete my purchase by phone, but of course they are only open from Monday to Friday! I am totally frustrated with this. The software keeps sending me around in circles without downloading the State and transferring the info. I have used Turbo Tax for many years and have been quite happy. This year is a different story.
I bought a TurboTax deluxe. I paid $10.00 more for that version because it had the state download too. Entering all the information was easy as it said, but when I went to do my state, the program was running me in circles and encouraging me to buy a download for my state at $39.00. By this time, I was frustrated, and against my better judgment, I did it, only to get nothing. I'm into TurboTax for $90.00 now, and I can’t even file my federal tax because I still need to do my state. I called the help line. Wow! It says I have a 42 minute wait - that’s no joke. I waited the full time. The young man I was speaking to did not understand my problem. There was a minute of silence and then he hung up on me. Oh my God, can you imagine my frustration now? I then tried the online chat version of help. I waited a little bit to speak to a young lady who seemed like she wanted to help me. She told me that she would refund my state download and set me up with free TurboTax. Hmm, it took a little convincing, but I went for it. I joined the online TurboTax she told me she set me up with free deluxe; I should scroll down until I see it. When I saw it, the entire chat page disappeared - no more help, no refund, nothing. I reloaded all my information on the free online version. I was impressed and I saw my state build too. Yeah, I went on to file it. Wow! They charge another $60.00. I have to wait for a refund for the online download, and a refund for the disc that I will be sending back before I can go any further with TurboTax. I tried the online thing again to get my refund (recommended when you ask for a refund). When this person could not sway me to do the online thing, she said that she could not get me a refund, and that I had to call that number again. Hahaha! This time, it was a 62-minute wait. I hung up.
I was unable to use the free version as it forced me to use the pay version. The IRS sent my refund to TurboTax's bank on February 6th. They have to take the fee and then send the refund to my bank. They claim they still don't have the refund from the IRS. They told me to call the IRS back. I did, and the IRS told me to call TurboTax. I spent another 1 hour 45 minutes on chat with a supposed customer service representative, who basically told me that the IRS is behind. He said this not once but more like five times. I finally got frustrated and told him that this was not a viable argument since the IRS had already sent it to TurboTax's bank. All anyone has told me to do is go through the same hoops I already have. And then when they realize I have already done all this, they tell me to wait. When I asked what to do if I waited another week and still didn't have it, they told me to call them back. I imagine at that point that I will be sent in the same circles just as I was now. It’s really nice that I paid them a fee, and they refuse to help or back their own bank up. Ridiculous! I am disgusted and will never, ever, ever use TurboTax again. A friend of mine filed after me and asked for a paper check and already received it. The TurboTax site tells me that 96% of people filing at the same time as me have already received their refunds, but they still try to blame the IRS and refuse to research anything or to assist me at all. I fear that their bank lost my refund, and they refuse to acknowledge that or try to help. I have no idea what to do, and I am an unemployed single mother of a 6-year old and we’re about to lose our home. Thanks TurboTax. Go screw yourself. I will be reporting this to the BBB as well.
TurboTax caused us to be audited by the IRS. The auditor's first question was, "Did you use TurboTax?" Apparently, the errors are so consistent the IRS can easily spot them for audit. Bad importing of data, mis-classification of donations as sales, so many errors that ordinary people don't pick up on. Between the adjusted tax, interest and penalties, it cost over $20,000. I filed a claim with TurboTax and got a denial so quickly they couldn't possibly have actually reviewed it. And they were rude! Rude in every email they sent! Terrible, terrible, terrible. Using a CPA from now on. Better to support a small, local business anyway.
I have used TT for years with no problems. This year I've had no income, but they have made it impossible for me to access the free form, after mistakenly beginning the form that updates from the previous year (Basic). Plus, they no longer make individual forms available, and have no help except for other confused customers, whose questions are so numerous and detailed, there is no way to extract any useful information. There were no answers anyway. The other problems I ran into on a three-hour aborted effort were: They tagged employer contributions to HSA as excess when they are not. They taxed all of my husband's social security even though our household income was far under the cutoff for owing taxes on his benefits. They had us pay $1500 in federal taxes, when we have three people living on my husband's social security, far under the poverty line. And they send you in circles and circles and circles, reviewing the same material over and over again. It's insane. I've been a loyal satisfied customer for years, but never, never, never again especially after reading the other posts here! I count myself among the lucky ones. I can fill out a paper form and send it in without risk of penalty or paying for a broken program.
TurboTax Deluxe 2012 - I filed my federal and Mississippi state tax. The federal tax processed fine and was accepted within hours. The Mississippi state tax was rejected within hours, saying missing or incorrect info, but they wouldn't give me details. So, I rechecked it and saw nothing wrong. I resubmitted and got rejected again. I changed a few things, thinking it might fix it, but got rejected a third time. I called the Mississippi Department of Revenue, and they said that TurboTax has a date glitch or something that they were working on. They told me not to change anything on my return but wait on a fix update from TurboTax. I doubt I'll use them again. They need to test their software before releasing it for millions to use.
I filed using the TurboTax free addition but will never, never, never do it again. It should have been a simple this is how much I earned, how much I paid in taxes and no other deductions or claims. Three days after I submitted my form, I received a rejection notice from TurboTax but they don't tell me why it was rejected. They only give me the link to Fix It Now. I reviewed my form and cannot see any problem, so I resubmit. One week later, I have heard nothing from TurboTax. But when I tried to check my status, it won't let me back into my account because there is an authentication error. After contacting online customer support and waiting 45 minutes, I am told that I need to try and access my account in a different browser. I tried but it still won't allow me into my account and I have no idea where or what TurboTax has done with my return. I am glad I did not pay for this service - that would have really pissed me off.
I'm just going through the motions and following the prompts. I ended up paying $36.99 for filing my State (which apparently is free in IL otherwise) and $29.99 for Federal. Also, the cost of purchasing the software itself was $65+. It is ridiculous. I will not be using this software next year. It claims to be the way to file and I have used it for years, but this is just crazy. I feel so stupid for paying all this!
In my opinion, you should avoid Turbo Tax. It has a bug and does not get you the maximum refund. I used it twice just for fun, before I visited my CPA with over 30 years experience, to get a rough estimate of what I would owe. Both times he was able to get me over $4000 more than Turbo Tax (No, there are no shady gimmicks; unfortunately, there are no excuses for why Turbo Tax sucked). When I tried Turbo Tax last year, I wasn't able to continue because it found "an error" with the Home Buyers Credit. It wasn't an error - it was a bug with their software. I chatted with them for hours, called them up, nobody could help me. There were just excuses like, "You did it wrong" or "Our CPA isn't available right now, you have to contact us later". One person even stated that I should file the return without the credit, then file an amended return manually! Why waste my time? This year I tried it again; nope, it's still buggy. It won't let me complete a return for the same reason. The issue? I purchased my house with another person; we both got the buyer's credit. The IRS states a married couple must share the credit, but nothing about two single people who purchase a home jointly and file separate returns. Yes, interest deductions must be shared 50%, but not a buyer's credit. So we both got $7,500 for a total of $15,000. Two separate returns. Again, IRS rules don't state we can't; so why is Turbo Tax making up rules? Now we are married. Turbo Tax insists that I'm wrong in putting that we received $15,000 and the maximum can only be $7,500. The software does not account for my specific scenario. It assumes we were married when we purchased the home and got the credit. That's not true. My CPA who has done thousands and thousands of returns a year agrees. So why can't the people at Turbo Tax get this right? What other bugs are hiding in their software? Why do you need to wait almost an hour for support? Why won't they fix a bug that is reported to them? And yes, it's true. In case you ever wondered, Turbo Tax will not get you the maximum refund. I followed all their wizards to the exact step, gave the same inputs to Turbo Tax and my CPA. Turbo Tax actually took longer since their site is so slow at times. So don't bother, avoid it and find a decent CPA instead.
TT subtracted my military retirement during the gross income calculation even though it had not added it in as it was entered by me as non-taxable (0). This gave me a momentary orgasm as the refund amount was tremendous. Upon further investigation and my doing the state forms manually, there is a flaw in one of the worksheets that if you answer both questions correctly about income reported on your federal but not your state, it assumes it should deduct this amount from your gross income and shows it on page 1 as a negative amount. My first year with TT and my last. I spent hours using it and ended up doing my taxes manually in 30 minutes. If I could get my money back, I would!
Though the TurboTax product is generally fine, the customer service representative charged me the highest fee of a combination of their home/business package. When I selected the online free federal return, they refused to change it. I explained to her that I can prove that I do not have a business at this time, against her assertion that her choice was the correct product for me. I have kept all records. The presumption by a retail business when this type of civil offense occurs is that the customer won’t likely go to a small claims court over it because of the nominal fee involved. However, if enough customers experience this same type of override, then a class action suit may be in order, thus, the reason for my post.
I took a couple of hours to complete Turbo Tax online. It seemed easy enough. When I finally attempted to file, Intuit tells me IRS forms were not ready. The wording implied that it was the IRS' fault. Intuit had a nice feature that they would notify me when the forms were ready. A couple of days later, I received the email notice. I returned to Intuit site only to tell me the forms were not ready. Additional research found that the Intuit is the problem, not the IRS. I'm done with Turbo Tax. I found another popular online filing program - for less money too!
I have been using TurboTax for over 5 years. This year's program is flawed. During the looking for errors assessments process, an automated message appears stating, "div/state not entered." After 1 hour and 40 minutes, it was not resolved. It keeps looping you in a circle. As a result, I started using the H&R Block software. I entered the exact same data and had no problems. Thanks H&R Block. The same $ amount expected to come back with either software. Don't waste your time this year. Too bad, TurboTax was really strong for awhile.
I used TurboTax to complete my federal (FED) and state income taxes. When the FED completed, at the very end, I received an error that indicated my FED return could not be e-filed due to a HSA Acct withdrawal for medical expenses and that I would have to file my return manually with an 8889 form. I had to search for that, complete it manually, and send it. Then I completed my state taxes, which simply auto-populated the information from my FED filing, and after it said everything was okay - no errors - it e-filed it. Later in the day, I was notified that the state rejected my e-filing, and I was not given a reason. I went through the steps recommended by TurboTax but could find nothing. I set up a chat to ask questions. And after waiting 45 minutes online for a person, I explained the issue, and she said she could not help me. I must go to the state IRS Office and see why my return was rejected. I said if my return was not accepted, then it's the same as if it has not been filed by TurboTax. She said if you completed your return and e-filed it, that means you were satisfied with our service and a refund cannot be made. I said simply that completing the forms does not mean they were filed, so the TurboTax service is incomplete. She ended the chat service at that point. Rude! I feel they need to complete the service, or refund me the fee charged for filing a return that was rejected without telling me why.
I called Turbo Tax to find out what package we needed (I don't want things to come back on us). The girl had no idea; I waited for 45 min. because they say they have tax pros with all the new laws that no one understands. We want the right forms. We are also tired of paying $200-$300 to get our taxes done. But the girl could not answer the questions. I found myself getting more and more angry until I finally thanked her for her time and hung up. Now I don't trust you all and won't get the product.
I was charged and unable to delete one of my returns. I was not given an option and was unable to contact anyone. I will not use TurboTax nor recommend it. It used to be a great service. Their filing screen made it seem like I had to pay and then reverse by viewing status and by choosing action/delete. Too late! This is not sound customer service. Also, I didn't like your new screens vs. the last few years.
At the beginning, it says the basic service is free, a big green free button with no asterisk. At the time to submit, it asks you for $19.99. This is a bait and switch. It was only at this point I was able to find a page that explains how the free service isn't free. I feel pretty pissed after sitting here for an hour typing numbers, and I get scammed. (Here are some keywords from me to Intuit: scam, ruse, bait and switch, lawyer, lawyers, class action lawsuit, closed, closing fines, and jail.) Stop advertising things for free that are not free anywhere, at any point, and for any reason.
The deluxe version stated that it included both the federal and state returns. Everything was fine with the federal but the state would not work unless I paid another $39.99. There is no way to contact them for a refund.
My refund was directly deposited to my Turbo Tax card. Everything was okay until Turbo Tax closed my card with $2,600 on it. I’ve sent them the information they wanted three times, and they still have not released my money to me or the IRS. It has been one year now and still nothing. I’ve contacted the IRS, and they’ve sent Turbo Tax a letter and still nothing. How can I go about getting my money back?
I have used TT for many years. Last year, TT reported my tax amount as $10,371 and I got my refund. No problem. I then had to amend my return for a DIV statement I received later in the amount of $11 (I did not need to but did know any better). Next thing I know is I received a bill of $360 from the IRS. After 4 trips to the IRS office and spending much time, the mystery was solved. It was found that my tax amount was actually $10,731 (and not $10,371 as stated in the TT program) - a difference of $360. On contacting Turbo Tax customer service for a refund for all the time spent on their error and pointing out their 100% accuracy guarantee, I was told that the IRS was at fault and that I should take up the matter with them. It is extremely shameful for such a large organization to treat good customers in such a poor manner.
I paid $59.98 for my federal to be completed and they want me to pay another $36.99 for my state tax. I wouldn't pay. I will send off with paper return before I give them another penny. They are liars.
I have used TurboTax for years. I received a notice from the IRS in Dec. 2012 that my 2010 taxes were incorrect due to a re-characterization of an IRA. Fortunately, my financial adviser contacted the IRS and got it resolved. The issue was that TurboTax could not calculate this, and I had to override the program and that required me to not be able to file electronically and caused the IRS to look at my return very closely. The issue here was that the IRA lost value from the time it was converted to the time it was re-characterized; thus there was no way for the amounts to match. Now, I just received a notice from the State Income Tax Department that my 2009 TurboTax state return is incorrect. This was an error directly from TurboTax. I now owe back taxes, penalties and interest. I will not be using TurboTax again. It is just not worth the fines.
I filed 2010 return, paid extra for the audit review and also their audit defense. I got a letter about 6 months ago telling me I owed $30,000.00 to IRS. We got a refund that year of about $2,000.00. We don’t even make that kind of money. I have been speaking with the tax people supposed to be handling with IRS for me. They said they sent my true tax papers in and got a confirmation, but then the other day they said IRS said they didn't receive it so they had to send it again. This is like a nightmare. I got a cert letter from IRS the other day still stating that I owe them $30,000.00 for 2010 taxes. I am going to have to get a tax attorney; I don’t trust them to take care of this for me. I will never use them again.
I was contacted by TurboTax in October to tell me that the software had calculated my tax wrong (Federal Land Rental Issue). They offered to recalculate the tax for me, and I let them do so. The change increased my taxes by more than $3k. I then needed to resubmit two states' worth of tax forms. Since I had previously filed an amended return in May, TurboTax was unable to file a second amendment. After some time with a TurboTax rep, who actually was able to converse in English (a first), I was instructed to reconstruct my federal and state taxes from scratch. Since then, I have filed my returns again, with interest and penalties, only to find that the Feds, and both states have found that the updated TurboTax calculations were incorrect. I am now getting most of the additional payments (>$6k) refunded from the states and Feds. I turned over the calculations to the Feds and the states. Whatever they charged was going to be cheaper than hiring a forensic accountant or depending on TurboTax (it's a trust issue).
I have used TurboTax for several years without problems. However, my 2011 federal and state taxes that were electronically filed with TurboTax were never sent. The IRS contacted me by mail. I thought that it was a scam since I had records of my electronic filing with TurboTax. I called the IRS general number to report the scam. Only it wasn't a scam. My joint return was not received. I now owe penalty and interest. I've tried to talk to TurboTax about the problem. The best I get is an online chat that goes nowhere and ends up being a waste of time.
The problem was resolved by patches to the software. This first time problem was caused by our indecisive Congress and should be a one time event.
I have been doing my taxes with Turbo Tax for the last 3 years. This year, I was audited by the IRS so I needed to go back to 2009 and get my tax information. I could not get it off my computer so I called Turbo Tax and asked for a copy. They told me they couldn't get my information because I didn't send it. I told them I had a confirmation that my taxes had been sent and accepted by the Federal and State. They said the best they could do is let me redo my taxes. Also, I bought their audit defender and they were of no help. I won't buy this product ever again! Oh, and the auditor told me that Turbo Tax is very confusing and you can easily answer wrong and it will cost you penalties.
I received a notice from the IRS that there was an error on my 2010 return, which TurboTax prepared, saying that I owe $2,500 plus interest. I scoured the website and found a phone number which just directed me to the support page where I found the question I needed an answer for. And they are telling me that I have to submit the entire notice from the IRS, all my tax documents and 2010 return, and proof that I have paid the tax and interest owed on the first notice. They will take 8 to 12 weeks to determine if the error was theirs. I just got laid off my job; I don't have $2,600 to pay the IRS in full! TurboTax is a huge rip-off. I will never use them again. H&R Block is a better deal and they have actual offices that you can go to and talk to a real live person! Has anyone else had this problem? How did you solve it?
Really? I was out of the country for eight months due to a funeral and started working in KY in September 2009. I just received a mail three days ago stating I owe $867 and change, for TurboTax being Turbo retarded. TurboTax initiated a return for $14,856 income when I made only $6,513. So now, I have the government on my ass for ignorance. I use them every year. Now I have to go back every year and see if there are more mistakes. I am really considering hiring a lawyer to sue these ignorant individuals.
I included a 1099-MISC and TurboTax did not prompt me for a Sch C or an SE. Thus, TurboTax should prompt you for the Sch C and SE. I received a letter from IRS that taxes were due. This would not have happened if the program had prompted me for these forms.
We filed our Idaho return and according to TurboTax, we were to receive a $105 refund. We received a call from the Idaho Tax Commission that we would not be receiving a refund but owed over $1,500 with interest and penalties. We were then told that many filers who had used TurboTax were experiencing the same problem, some glitch in their software. Since we did not purchase their insurance, TurboTax says too bad, so sad, you should have bought the insurance. Well, we will never use TurboTax again.
Turbo Tax figured my Federal Tax incorrectly. I now owe the IRS $459.00. Reviewing the return, I see no possible reason for this error. It was a simple straightforward return. I would have done better doing it by myself.
I have used Quicken since 2002 and Turbo Tax since 2008 and this year, I found numerous software errors in Turbo Tax. As a software engineer, I know what caused Turbo Tax 2011 to screw up my state and Federal tax returns. Still, it is June 2012 and I am owed $4500 in refunds which the state of NY still has not refunded my 2011 income tax and it's nearing July 2012. All my NYS income tax was refundable and a portion was to go to the state of Alabama. I did my Federal 1040 using 2 W2's and one 1099. When I sent it to the IRS and Alabama, I realized Turbo Tax has not included a W2 with $65K gross salary. Alabama and the IRS refunded what Turbo Tax said I owed, but when I recalculated it, I learned the IRS owed me an additional $522 and even while I owed Alabama about $1200, Turbo Tax reported a Alabama refund of $1100 and Alabama paid it. Now, I have to file a NY IT-203 and use a corrected Federal 1040 for New York. New York owes me $3900 because I never worked or lived there in 2011 and my employer made a mistake. They also did not fix this meaning this will happen when I file in 2013. I filed the correct NY IT-203 and fixed 1040's on May 15th with all $3900 refundable from NY, but as of June 16, New York has not refunded my 2011 income tax causing me extreme financial hardship. My belief is, NY is delaying the tax return because it has a corrected Federal 1040A and Schedule A, and it does not match the initial 1040A and Schedule A's and no one has looked into this. Also, I am a month behind in paying all rental, utilities, and child support and now that I am unemployed, Alabama will not provide UE. I have no money to pay for groceries, gas. tax. rent, utilities, car payments, insurance and have already incurred a cost of $165 using Turbo Tax and about $175 in fines and fees from my bank, landlord and utility payment delays. This problem began in March 2012 because of Turbo Tax and has spread. I tried to contact Intuit to get a refund of their $165 fee for using Turbo, and now my Unemployment is being paid by the wrong state. When the auditors are done, I will owe more fines. No more Turbo Tax. Go to H&R Block. As for Quicken, I have no choice except refuse to upgrade each year like I used to.
I filed my taxes through TurboTax in January. I selected the card option. I tried to activate the card. TurboTax said to give it 3 to 5 days. Every time they requested different documents, even the ridiculous ones. After several weeks, they said the account was permanently closed and to contact the IRS for a paper check. The IRS put two traces on the money. I received the traces back over the course of several weeks. I was instructed by the IRS to contact Bancorp Bank; I did contact them and sent all documents to them, which even included me holding my driver’s license up in front of me, on the webcam in front of the computer. They would not open the account or send money to me or back to the IRS. I have waited 5 months for my money. I have been treated very unfairly by literally over a hundred people. I am a single mother of six; instead of being caught up on bills, I am further behind with past due and penalties. I have done everything the IRS has asked me to and filed out all the forms with no results. I cannot see how a bank can hold my money in an account this long. I really need someone to help me on this. They know I don’t have the means to hire an attorney.
Turbo Tax still wanted to charge me a State Refund fee even though my Fed Refund didn't happen. I tried emailing them back the below with no success: Due to the fact that Turbo Tax software did not give me another choice, but to use the Turbo Tax Refund Processing Service, and because it was part of the electronic filing process, I feel this is unfair and not justified. I do appreciate the waiving of the Federal Refund Processing Service fee. My taxes were adjusted by the IRS and as you know, there was no refund involved. I have used Turbo Tax for over ten years now. Turbo Tax has not ever charged anything when filing electronically to the IRS before. Turbo Tax should not intervene in that process - period. Turbo Tax software is expensive enough and should not try to rip its users off for more money. Tax time is painful enough! It's bad enough we have to pay our government, but to pay extra fees for using the Turbo Tax software that we have already purchased is ridiculous! I guess since you already have my bank account information, you will proceed to deduct my bank account for more money. I will not use Turbo Tax ever again if this money is deducted from my account. There are other products on the market that understand that we, the people, must pay our governments, and does not require extra fees at tax time.
Well, TurboTax has been holding on to my money, going on three months now. The IRS tracked my money and requested I might have to file a lawsuit on TurboTax if they don't send the money back to the IRS. I have sent all of my paper to confirm I am who I am. I'm trying to be calm and fair to give them time but like I said, it's been three months. So after next week, I will have my lawyer to take over.
Using TT Premier with Windows XP, efiled with debit information to pay taxes. After three weeks and no debit, called IRS who said they had not received efile. Opened TT and final page said efile not submitted although all information was there. Several issues with TT and XP: files would not print, had to save as PDF then print, would not do cost basis, so suspect it was another software conflict that Intuit didn't warn us of. Anyone ready for a class action lawsuit?
Oh my gosh, I signed in and it will not find my return! Oh yeah, previous year, but not this year. So now I can't print it. And there was no number to reach these idiots and yes, I mean idiots. For as much as they charged, I should be able to easily get a phone number. I'll never use them again. Ever.
Charges not clearly spelled out up front - I am furious with these people! Do not use TurboTax! They are bait and switchers and will charge you inconsistent amounts and bank fees. Ripoff alert! Call Clark Howard and file a complaint with your State Attorney-General's office. We all need to find a lawyer, who would like to rip these bait and switchers. If they had a place on their website that's easy to find that dealt with complaints, I would not be here. Intuit is not interested in helping; it's just ripping people off! I'm out $129.00 in fees. The bank refund processing fee is $29.95, tax preparation fee is $89.90, and applicable state tax is $6.30.
Free government TurboTax through Intuit is unstable. During the preparation of my taxes, I had to redo items more than once since the system overrode what I wrote. Each time I saved the document and reopened it, I had a different income, or some other fact changed and it was difficult to get back in to correct it. For instance, the New York City address of my bank changed to NYC Pennsylvania. I am concerned that my taxes were filed properly, but to the best of my knowledge, I corrected all their erroneous changes. I've used TurboTax before with no problems but that was with a purchased copy. This one was the free version so maybe that is the problem. But it's disconcerting that what I typed was not what I got when I would reopen the file.
I filed with TurboTax for a federal filing extension until October 15, 2012. I have done this before with no problem. I then received an email from TurboTax saying that the extension had been rejected. Even though my spouse's name and Social Security number are included in the information in my TurboTax account, they were apparently not on the extension form that was sent to the IRS. I was not given a chance to review the information, it was simply sent off. The email said that I had until April 22, 2012 to resubmit the information. Every time I went on the TurboTax link to resubmit, the program, however, would not send it. There is no contact number on their site, only a forum where other users can talk to each other. They are basically using us to counsel other TurboTax users - this is ridiculous! On Sunday, April 22, I was still attempting to refile my extension; however, when I went to the site, there was a message that the site was down temporarily and would be back up soon. Hours later, the message was still up, so I went back to the users' forum where I discovered that TurboTax was claiming that the deadline for resubmission was at 7:00 or 8:00 am on April 22nd and that emails had been sent to update us. I received nothing and, judging from the angry comments I read from other users, neither did anyone else. The suggestions included mailing a paper resubmission; however, it is impossible to have anything postmarked on a Sunday. Finally, I called the IRS this morning, only to be told that if my extension had been rejected, there was no grace period or deadline to refile. The woman I spoke to said that the April 22nd deadline was "a TurboTax deadline, not ours." She said that if an extension was not received and approved by the April 17th deadline, then there is no way to file it later. Because TurboTax submitted an incomplete extension form and lied about there being a "grace period" to refile, I now have to get my taxes filed as soon as possible and will still have to pay a hefty fine! I don't understand how TurboTax can be permitted to mislead consumers with such impunity or why the IRS has them on their website! The IRS rep said that they are not responsible for the TurboTax software problems and I agree. But with so many complaints against them, I would think that the IRS would at least investigate and take the company off their official website and permit users who have their extension filing documentation to resubmit their requests.
I continued to try and file a tax return for 2012 and it cost me money on top of money. I have used Turbo Tax Deluxe for years but this time around, it was more than a burden than it was worth. Useless information and useless format and useless waste of time. I will never purchase it again!
I had to do an amended 2011 return. When I clicked to amended return, the window came up showing procedures to follow that looked like a point I would be at, if I were half way through the procedure. I retried several times with the same result. I finally tricked my return into thinking it was an amended return, and went from there. No matter what it did, TurboTax never produced a finished 1040X form on the screen, filled in or blank. I had to resort to go online to procure an IRS 1040X form, printed it out and filled it in by hand.
I filed my federal and it went through. But then on the 17th I discovered, despite the phonies’ assurance that it went through, that it didn't. All that after spending 9.5 hours! I had to spend 3 more trying to get my state to go through. I had to print out a copy and mail it in that night. I think they are thieves of time! Today, I received a survey, which I had completely marked anything, with an explanation of problem. When I hit finished, I was given a message there was an error and all data that was there was deleted. I guess they only want positive responses.
I have been using TurboTax for many years. This is the first time I have had an issue, but it was a big one. I purchased the Deluxe version online in November 2011. I typically file the last minute. When I attempted to print and file, a fee of almost $80 was required to be paid first. When I spoke to an agent, she reduced the fee to $39 for the state form. She said I was sent an email in March to tell me that my purchase price would be voided and increased if I filed at some later date. I never received such an email. This was an outright lie. But how can a company tell you at the last minute that they would not honor the original purchase price? After filing by e-file, I still had to run out and find a post office to mail what I owed the government, which made the e-filing ridiculous; I could have mailed it all. At any rate, once you purchase a program, it is disgusting to attempt to double the cost at the last minute in order to use it. They held me hostage, really. I will never trust a company that works in such a fraudulent, deceptive manner.
I started my Business/Personal taxes on April 16, 2011, went online for all the updates and spent the 17th finishing up. My post office was open till 9pm so finished, we up and hit "print" at 6pm. Printer shut down and all info on forms disappeared. We could not retrieve them no matter what we tried. We called a computer expert and he said Turbo Tax has a problem like that on some Macs. We had to attempt to reconstruct info, ended up paying $500 more to federal and $350 more to state because we didn't have time to go into depth on itemization forms. Then, we had to file electronically because it was now 11pm on the 17th and use a credit card which added a $130 convenience fee and pay $29.99 for filing a state fee. Is anyone considering a class action against Turbo Tax? If so, count me in.
I started to file my 2011 taxes and chose 'basic' at the start and spent a couple of hours doing my return on 4/17/2012. When I got to the end of the process, they wanted to charge me about $80.00 to file and print, which included $39.95 for the federal which is advertised as free. When you try to contact them, you will find out that it is impossible. Now I will have to pay a penalty for filing late. Thanks, Turbo Tax!
I have been a Turbo Tax customer for more than 6 to 7 years and never had a problem. In fact, I was an advocate and bragged about your system. This year it was a catastrophe. I never got to file my 2010 1040 or my state forms. Your system would not make a connection! I had already entered and finished my spouse's in March. I also started my own 2010 filing during that time. However when I went back to finish and e-file my forms, beginning on March 16 and still today, I cannot get into your site. The more I tried the more I could not get a secure connection. There was one time that I got into my files for a short time but was kicked off. Because of your program, I did not file on time. I was forced to go to another web page and pay money to file for an extension at 12:05. I pray that the Feds accept my extension even though it was 5 minutes late. My question is, why did this happen? And that Turbo Tax calls me about this issue.
I tried to use the free TurboTax option. It still made me pay, then my return has been denied and the option to "fix it" is no option at all. I’m low income, I won't be getting my return back now because my estranged husband has already filed with my name on it and I want my ** money back.
I have used TurboTax for probably 7 or 8 years without a problem. I have a fairly easy return, so I procrastinated until about 6:00pm on April 17th to start my return, knowing it was easy and I could just hit the e-file button. I finished it in about 30 or 40 minutes and went to do a wrap and print and was given the message that TurboTax does not support some form due to tax code changes so I could not e-file. I could never figure which form, no matter how many times I entered the credits area (which was where the problem was supposed to be). I was spitting mad. I bought this product because it is supposed to be an all inclusive up to date product and it has been until this year. To really make matters worse, TurboTax cheerfully announced they could proceed with the taxes but I would have to find a mailbox! There I was at 7:00pm scrambling to find a post office that would do the 12am postmark. Never, ever again will I use this product. I have always thought it could be more user-friendly but this just tops it all. I will be demanding my money back. I’m sure TurboTax could care less.
Overcharged for filing return without notice of price increase! - When I originally started my return, I was told it would be $29.95 for me to file. When I went to file and send the paper, it charged me $84.95, then charged my bank $91.96! they said that the $29.95 was a special, if you filed before a special date. This was never sent to me. I was never notified of this or of course I would have done it. Very misleading to their customers. I will not use them again!
I spent the time and effort required to complete my 2011 income tax return using Turbo Tax Basic. I completed it on April 15, 2012 and upon selecting the necessary option for print in order to mail it, I was greeted with a system crash. I tried several times using suggested work at rounds, none of which worked. I also manually updated the Turbo Tax as recommended and the same problem occurred. I also tried to save the return to a PDF but that crashed also. I called the file up for preview with the intent to save it in PDF but that crashed also. I noted that a lot of finger pointing was taking place with Intuit saying that Microsoft had done some security updates that were causing the problem. All that said, actions seem absent and the customer has no real solution. I tried to contact Intuit but could not do so. Here we are hours away from midnight, April 17, 2012 and there is no apparent solution. Responsible vendors would have put out a relief program or fix that would have allowed the customer to print the essential files to be printed for an event as important as meeting the tax return deadline. I was using Turbo Tax by Intuit for the first time and you can rest assure it will be the last time. Customer service is absent totally.
This service is a scam... they say free, but then would let you file federal unless you pay $39 for state filing. This is deceptive and consumers should be aware to avoid this horrible service.
I used TurboTax in 2009 and 2010 and it was fine. I printed the pages I wanted to keep handy and burned the entire filing to a CD. This year (2011), the only thing I could do was save my filing to an Adobe file. When I tried to print, some pages would print and some would not. The first page of the 1040 form would print, but the second page comes out blank. I couldn’t find any way to burn the filing to a CD. TurboTax apparently wants you to buy something extra in order to do that. I have used them for the past three years, but I doubt if I will use them again.
I'm initially unhappy that worksheet information did not roll into the forms and items had to be answered again and again. Then when time to file electronically, I was unable to because of no internet access, which was totally not true as I had access to the live chat throughout the process, but when time to file, nothing. This is my fifth year using TurboTax and the first time I have encountered such problems. Hopefully, these issues will be resolved before next year. I use the Home Business version and feel that it's too much money not to be able to use the service as advertised.
After going through the rather lengthy process of finding the contact information and going through the help categories, the live chat contact window disappeared as I was typing my name. I went through the whole process again and then had to wait for over an hour for an agent. After the first agent read my question, I received a message that I had to wait for another agent. After reading my message, this agent asked me which form the question was about. I mentioned that I had listed the form number in my message and gave it to him again. He said that he needed to call up the form and would get right back to me. Then the live chat window disappeared and I never heard from him again. I need to send my return tomorrow, but I'm not going through this again.
I have used TurboTax before and was satisfied so I went back again this year. And now, I am being charged $79.00 or $79.99, I was too upset to remember, for my State and Federal taxes. This was $50.00 more than what the upfront fee quote was. I had to put it on my credit card because they wanted me to pay another $29.99 if they took it out of my refund. I am very upset as this may cause a financial hardship due to a rough economy. I usually help my family with bills and did not anticipate this. Please help me. The deadline is tomorrow so I feel they are taking advantage and raised the rates overnight. Now I am worried they are shady and I won't even get my refund.
Turbo Tax Deluxe - I have always used to TurboTax to e-file my taxes. I will never again use them. They say my federal has too many forms to e-file, but my sister, who has a much bigger tax packet, was able to e-file hers. I've researched the internet about this year's TurboTax. It seems others were also misled about what "free state" meant. They want me to pay $19.99 to e-file the state forms. I've used TurboTax to file my taxes for many years, but I'm done. I will never again use TurboTax. I would like to have my $59 refunded. Again, I will never purchase TurboTax again.
E-filing was rejected - I have always used to TurboTax to e-file my taxes. This year however, I mailed my return. Additionally, I've researched the internet about this year's TurboTax. It seems your program has caused thousands of people to mail their tax returns to the IRS. I've used TurboTax to file my taxes for many years, but I'm done. I will never again use TurboTax. And, stop sending me emails that state the IRS has extended the e-filing deadline. You should be ashamed for ripping off people. Honestly, I would like to have my $36 refunded. Again, I will never purchase TurboTax again.
My sister had the exact same problem as Tiffany did after calling IRS and Turbo Tax, and repeatedly faxing any and all required info. She called and told Turbo Tax she would now contact the media and an attorney. Within 24 hours her money was back on her card. Don't give up and good luck. I have never had a problem with them myself but will never again use them.
I switched from using an accountant to TurboTax 2 years ago. Big mistake! There were so many errors with our filings I can't include them all here. I ended up with a horrendous IRS audit that is still ongoing trying to sort out the TurboTax mess. Warn everyone you know not to use this software.
I have been using TurboTax for quite a few years, and although you really do have to know what you are doing to get good results, it's easier to use than a real 1040 form. Although, really, mine would be 1040EZ; and it is close to being a waste of money for a simple return. It's nice, because you can get it to import your info for the next. I have had no problems in the past years, and this year, when I did, my returns at the beginning of February all went well, except I could not print out a copy for my records. With all the problems lately with security, I have my internet at a high security and thought this was the problem. Over a course of about 3 hours and a couple of days, I turned off the security and tried many ways of printing. TurboTax was not showing any help on the problem at all, except other people stating the same problem and their solution. Install Firefox. So I waited until today to try again as my returns was at least filed. TurboTax has a problem listed right on the print screen now saying to "install a different browser or delete all the info and setting in your own." This does not seem acceptable at all. I have been searching their FAQ for hours again, and it shows no way to contact them. And it's about impossible to navigate with any kind of internet security turned on. And the main reason I wrote this was because my last resort was try and give TurboTax a bad feedback on their page, but It will not error to a point where you can allow one action from their website. All I want is a printed copy. I will not be buying TurboTax next year if It is not solved quickly and easily. I am using the same computer as last year, so what's the difference? Are they getting a kickback from Google Chrome for pushing it?
TurboTax’s fees and cost of services were too high. When I asked a question (and I had many), it would not answer them. It took me to other areas (sometimes related subjects), but most of the time why am I out in “no man's land”? It charges $29.95 to set-up a Visa account. I didn't know this until the end of completing my taxes. If I had known TurboTax would charge so much yet give me so little information on how to save money, I would not have chosen their services.
TurboTax Card by Intuit, Inc. placed a security hold on my debit card on 03/27/12. I was never prior notified there was an issue until I tried to purchase items and the transaction was declined. I immediately contacted TurboTax Card services by calling the number on the back of my card. I was told that I needed to fax in a copy of my driver's license, social security (signed), and two proofs of address. I faxed in the requested information the same day and was told that it would take 3-5 days for review. I contacted TurboTax Card services again on 04/03/12 to check the status. The TurboTax Card services representative and supervisor informed me that they saw no notation that the first fax had been received. I was told to refax the same information to the same number, but this time it would take 5-7 days. I faxed the requested information for the second time, but this time I called after faxing to verify that it had been received and was told by another TurboTax Card representative that it had been. I called back on 04/09/12 to speak to a representative with the company to find out if there had been any change because literally two weeks had past. I was told by another customer service representative with TurboTax Card services that they saw no notes regarding receiving the second fax. I was outraged! The supervisor named Carlos inquired which fax number that I had been given twice because he stated that it was a possibility that I was given the wrong fax number to the card security department. He gave me a new fax number to send my documents which contained my personal and private information that I normally protect so that incidences like this wouldn't happened. After hanging up with him, I searched for another and different number for TurboTax Card services hoping to reach someone who could give accurate information and explain further on what was happening to my money! I reached another department and was told that they would investigate this. I called back on 04/10 and 04/11 and still had not talked to anyone who could explain. On 04/12, I tried calling TurboTax Card’s service number that was located on the back on my card and reached an automated number which stated, “All lines are busy. Please check status on website.” I thought maybe I contacted during peak hours, so I called back again only to receive the same message. I used my daughter's cell phone who had been sitting right next to me because she was driving and allowed me to use her cell phone. When I dialed the number on the back of my TurboTax Card, I was immediately attached to the automated system which allowed me to enter card information to access a customer service representative. I immediately hung up the call and dialed from my phone again to see if I could access the same. Once again, I reached an automated message stating to check account status online. I did this 4 times repeatedly from her from my phone. Each time I dialed from her phone, I was able to access a customer service representative with TurboTax Card services, but I’m unable to do so from my cell phone that I had been using for the last two weeks to speak to representatives and supervisors in hopes of finding out why they were holding my tax refund money! I would appreciate if Consumer Affairs can investigate and/or advise me on what to do. After sending the same fax off 3 times (but really one time) to the new fax number, I was told that I would have to wait another 5-7 days for review. This experience dealing with TurboTax Card services has caused me great inconvenience! I have used my tax refund to pay bills, make payments towards my daughter's college graduation soon coming up, and vacation plans that I have already forfeited deposits because being unable to make next payment arrangements. My next step is to contact an attorney and sue! I will never use TurboTax again!
I was led to believe that, in order to file a paper copy of state tax only, the answers to the federal portion would need to be completed. I finished answering the federal questionnaire, with the understanding that these responses would be used to complete the state tax forms. I completed the filing process, with the understanding that at the end, I would be billed only for the state tax portion ($39.99). Instead, I was informed that my charge card would be billed for both state and federal plus tax ($97.00). Only then did I realize that there are no internet sites for Intuit or TurboTax billing issues. I sent an email to their tax support address, asking if they could not help, please let me know how to contact someone who could. Their response was to send me a questionnaire about their tax account card. I have already filed my federal taxes, and do not want another copy of federal taxes submitted. At this point, I do not know the status of the filings nor the money owed to state will also be withdrawn from my bank accounts. Once this group gets your money, you are left high and dry, with no way to get beyond tax questions. My only recourse at this point is to contact my credit card company, and place a stop payment on the TurboTax bill. I do not enjoy this course of action, but am lost at any other way of getting their attention. I hope this negative review gets a response.
Well, I heard it all in the emails, anywhere from $29.95 to $49.95. But in the end, the charges were $95.30 after agreeing to $89 something. Very deceitful company.
I found out my social security number had been used for someone else's tax refund. When I filed my return, it had been rejected a day or two later, but TurboTax did not email me to let me know that there was this important issue. They emailed me a receipt for all the money I paid for their services, but they failed to email this important status of my refund? Unacceptable. If I had known, I could have alerted authorities sooner, as the thief had filed for taxes using my social security number just a week before I attempted. I do not trust this company with such sensitive information.
I’m so frustrated and upset. TurboTax will never have to ever worry about me filing electronically with them. I filed my 2011 taxes and received my money on time February 1st. So, I barely spent my money. I so happened to check my card to see what was my available balance, only to find out that my account was put on hold for security review. So I called to see what the problem was. The rep told me that I had to fax over my picture ID, SS card, and a bill with my address on it. I did all of the above. They told me to call back 5-7 days and my account would be opened. I called back and they had closed my account permanently! They said that I wasn’t going to be able to receive my $4,484 that was left on my card. I called all the numbers and no one could help me (IRS and the bank that TurboTax deals with). All I can do is cry. I have called over and over and talked to supervisors and reps and they can not state why my account has been closed. Someone help me! I will not give up.
I asked for my tax refund to be given to me on their TurboTax Debit Card. I got the card and decided to not use up the balance right away so I could have some extra money for some school expenses I had coming. But when I went to use my card, I found the account "locked" for security they said even though I didn't have any problems. They had me fax over my ID, SS Card and Proof of Address and said it would take 4 business days to unlock. Yet, I have been waiting for over 2 weeks, with no money and they give me the run around each time I call. I've had to re-fax the info on 4 separate occasions and each time it's the same excuse "wait 5 business days". I'm frustrated and can't get anyone to help me get this done. I need my money! I've given them confirmation numbers. I have called to insure they've received the faxes. They gave me no notice and now, they have little money that I have and won't let me have access to it. What do I do now? I've found there are many people with this same problem.
I filed my taxes online via TurboTax. It was to be direct deposited and the fees would be paid through their third-party bank. My return got held up for review. I learned today it was due to my name change this year. Today, I got an email from Intuit/TurboTax. The email clearly states my return isn't large enough to cover their fees from the bank; so, they are dropping their services and I am to pay TurboTax their balance ASAP. Panicked, I called the IRS. The IRS has no idea what TurboTax is talking about. My return is clearly large enough to cover their little fees and have a few thousands to spare. I went online to TurboTax to chat with a "professional" there who at first told me the email was a scam. Then, I was told, “Oh, it is just in case you don't get your return by the 27th.” Then, I was told that it is all the IRS' fault and TurboTax did nothing. Well, wait - you did do something! The email was a complete lie. My return was large enough. Why scare me for no reason? Why not just say what the "professional" finally said at the end was that they weren't going to wait for me to get my return? So I get to wait 6-8 more weeks and TurboTax can have their money. I will never use TurboTax again. They could have emailed me the truth and not some made up lies. I would have been a lot happier. If the man on the chat hadn't given me the run around, I might have been a lot happier. The IRS was way more helpful than TurboTax!
They are nothing but a group of ill trained phone answerer. All I kept hearing was how strange it was. Despite my being knowledgeable, they kept having me do the same thing over and over again. I finally asked them whether they were aware of Einstein's theory of insanity. No one knew it, so I told them that is what they were doing. BTW, there are no "supervisors", despite being told that I would be connected with one. I knew more about it than they did. After hours of repetition, they put me on silence to "discuss" I figured a work around it and it went through. By the time they got back to me, I solved it and they wanted to know what I did. I asked them how much they were willing to pay me for the solution. You know that didn't happen. I have used TurboTax since 1999, this year and last, something went wrong. I will never use them again, as I could have done it faster with pencil and the free form. Do I exceedingly dislike their condescending attitude? More than they will ever comprehend. Don't walk away from their "service", run!
TurboTax computer system is utterly useless and calculates everything wrong! An example: TurboTax System guaranteed I would receive $900 back from the state and got their infamous green light and said it was confirmed and filed. Well, I received a $3 refund from the state and called Turbo to no avail. And then I spoke to the state of Michigan and they said that Turbo had made a huge error. I will never use them again. I wasted $69 doing so. They are the worst!
Turbo Tax will not pay for their screw up - I filed my 2010 Federal return using Turbo Tax because I heard from friends how easy it was to use. I recently received an audit letter from the IRS. The notice stated that I owed them $4,000+. This was a direct result in the way Turbo Tax used my filing status. Their software made all my calculations for me and somehow said that I claimed $79,000 in sales tax revenue when I didn't even make over $52,000. Both Turbo Tax and their audit defense partner have not tried to solve the issue at all, they are both just saying I better pay the IRS the money.
After using TurboTax online and e-filing on February 10, I finally received my refund card expecting $337 on it on March 25. The card only had $267 on it and I had paid for the service off my bank card. TurboTax could not come up with an explanation and suggested I call the IRS. I did. My returns according to their records were accepted on February 12 and the money deposited on February 17. Where did the money go? I went to use the card today on April 2 and find that my balance of $100 is gone! After a very unhelpful lady and me sitting on empty at the gas station, I had to call a friend to bring me some cash so I could get home. I am single and a laid off teacher. Every dollar counts. Shame on TurboTax and their fraudulent dealings. I do not have the money to seek recourse and am disgusted with the entire company. I hope they go bankrupt!
Tax refund miscalculation: On February 10, 2012, I used TurboTax Online to do my 2011 taxes. I sat for four hours filling in all the required information, and when I was done, I checked for errors. It was confirmed that there were no errors in my tax return. I was informed that I was eligible for the Child Tax Credit and the Earned Income Credit and would be receiving a tax refund of $4,254 for my federal taxes and $405 for my state taxes. I submitted my taxes through e-file at a cost of $118.89 to the IRS and did direct deposit. I was informed on February 11, 2012 that both my state and federal returns had been accepted. I received my state refund of $405 without a problem within a few days and expected the federal refund within 10-21 days. After continually checking on the status of my refund for three weeks, I was finally informed that my federal refund had been changed from $4,254 to $160 because it was determined that I was not eligible for the Child Tax Credit or the Earned Income Credit. I called TurboTax to inquire about the change, and unfortunately, the tax expert, even though she tried, could not help me. I called the IRS, and they informed me that I was not eligible for the Child Tax Credit or the Earned Income Credit because of my adjusted gross income. I called TurboTax again, and although the representative could not help me with the tax situation, I was able to get my filing fee of $118.89 refunded to me, which I greatly appreciate. I get a refund every year in the amount of between $3,000 and $4,500 from my federal taxes. I depend on this refund to help me get through the summer months, because I get laid off every summer. If the TurboTax online software had told me that I was not eligible for the Child Tax Credit or the Earned Income Credit and that I was only getting a federal return of $160, I would never have filed it. I would have redone it or took it to someone to look over before I filed. Because TurboTax misinformed me, I lost out on $4,094, and it is too late to fix it with the IRS, I feel that TurboTax should compensate me for my loss.
I filed my taxes on February 8, 2012. I chose to receive my refund of over $6000 to a TurboTax card so that I would have a card to pay for my wedding expenses since I do not have credit cards. I should have received the card within a week; my fiance received his within a few days. I kept waiting for mine everyday until I called and spoke to the most incompetent group of individuals I have ever dealt with in my life. I called and waited on hold for over 1 hour. The rep hung up on me since she did not agree with me. I called again and waited again one hour for someone to pick up the phone. I immediately asked to speak to a supervisor and waited one more hour for him to tell me this: the card did not arrive because TurboTax needed to verify my identity. They needed a copy of my driver’s license notarized and with my current address faxed to them. Not a problem, except I have a different address on my driver’s license—my parent’s address. I let him know that California DMV does not change your ID because of an address change and they just notated on the system. He let me know that I would not be able to get the card mailed to me because of this issue. So I asked for the card to be canceled. He stated that they had to wait 30 days before issuing a check to refund me the balance (today is 40 days and still not check) to keep any transactions from going through the account. Really. I never got a card or a card number, so how can something be posted to the card? It's been seven weeks since I filed my return and still no money. To me, this sounds very illegal: they do not have the authority to hold my funds. The bank can't even hold your funds—how can they? Please help!
After purchasing the CD, completing taxes, Turbo Tax deducting an amount for filing and me setting up my bank to receive my refund, Turbo Tax said I could not file electronically and I had to file by mail. When I clicked on file by mail, I was immediately sent to Turbo Tax's website to purchase the CD again. I was in a continuous loop to try and get out of it and there was no instruction as to how to file by mail. I went online to use the supposedly free Turbo Tax online to file. They advertised getting a refund in 7 days. So I completely had to redo my taxes again and when I went to file electronically, nothing happened. I could not file this way either.
We filed our taxes using TurboTax Deluxe on 2-06-12 and owed federal taxes which we paid. The program for the state taxes showed we were due a refund. The program did not show that there were errors on the state form and we were expecting a refund. After over 2 months, we called the state to find out where our refund was. They informed us that the form we mailed in was wrong and that we needed to amend our tax form and that we owed them money. We called TurboTax to find out what happened with their program, and after spending two and one-half hours with a person who apparently knew nothing about how to correct the problem, we finally asked for her supervisor who would call us 24-48 hours later. They finally called us and stated that he could download another program on our computer and give us next year’s program free. I told him that was unacceptable because we did not trust them and did not want to go back through another long process. He stated that they could not give us our money back. He is supposed to call me back today and I think I will ask for his supervisor. He was a tier 2 supervisor. This has been very frustrating to us and we are very upset because we have never had a problem with filing our taxes as we are honest people. I feel that their service is not dependable and I assume has erroneous information in their program. If their program has a fault in it, we feel we should be owed a refund of our money. I called my credit card company and they are filing a dispute with TurboTax. They stated we could look at the decision after 30 days.
I attempted to pay my tax preparation fee to TurboTax with my credit card. I immediately received a phone call from my bank stating the fraud against my card occurred in the amount of over $900. Nowhere could I find to report this on the TurboTax website. Also, now, I must deduct the fee from my refund which requires an extra $30 for me to pay. This site should be secure.
I have used Turbo Tax for many years with no real issues, other than the fact that the 'free file' they offer to military members does not include rolling over information from one year to the next. A minor issue compared with this. I had prepared my return this year, but was delayed by a missing 1099-MISC. Having that, I signed on (March 24, 2011) to update and file. Surprise! The fee of $29.99 increased to $49.99 effective...March 24, 2011. What kind of service raised their rates during peak season? I can think of a few notorious types that feed on their clients and now, Intuit's Turbo Tax. Next year, I will file on my own or use another online service.
In previous years, when I quick-zoomed to Form 4562, I could input my MACRS depreciation data directly onto Form 4562. I updated to TurboTax Premium for $30 and could finally and only enter my total depreciation value onto line 20 of Schedule E. I find it pretty sad that I had to pay $30 to do that while still being unable to enter the required MACRS data on line 17 of Form 4562 (assets put into service before 2011) or Section B, lines 19a to 19e. The question and answer is only for major assets, such as additional townhouses; it totally ignores assets, such as new flooring or carpeting, new stove, etc.
I filed my taxes electronically and even upgraded to the audit service on February 10, 2012. As of March 21, I still have not received my refund and find the Turbo Tax people completely unhelpful in trying to resolve this matter. I am a laid off, special education teacher and still have bills to pay. I need all the money I can. Obviously, to Turbo Tax, I am just a number. I don't recommend them!
I e-filed my federal and state returns using Turbo Tax Deluxe 2011. I expected to pay the $19.95 state filing fee, but the program funneled me into the Refund Processing Services requiring me to pay $29.95 to have the $19.95 taken out of my refund. Who in their right mind pays $30 to pay a $20 fee? I never saw an opt-out that allowed me another option (though Turbo Tax Customer Support assured me there was one). This is the first time in many years of using Turbo Tax that this issue has arisen. I think it's borderline criminal and that Intuit (Turbo Tax) knows exactly what they've done to many users like me.
I am using the TurboTax free edition for my mother. I am satisfied with the tax preparation part of the software but I got to a particular screen that showed someone else's personal information. The screen is "Enter your Registration Information" which is required to use e-file the return; I have a screenshot of it. It happened a little before 3/21/12, 9:52 am EST. It showed someone else's name, address and phone. It had my mom's email address. Do not know this person but it has me very worried about my mom's information. This was done on my personal home computer.
Incomplete function of Deluxe TurboTax: While I browse from previous years, I am not getting full information of dependents. When I am getting work by mail from customers, I need such information to prepare for 2012. How does your company hide this and not brought forwarding information about dependents? Also, Schedule D and Form 4136, etc. cannot be prepared easily straight away. It is very difficult to prepare. Please make it easy, as it was earlier in the past years. Also, kindly update your software to bright out the information about dependents completely for each dependent from the past year. Please advise me early and update my software immediately in my computer. Thanks.
Refund: I did all the work and waited almost two months and found out it's not even filed. I did exactly what I was supposed to do!
Turbo Tax Freedom is not free: I met the qualifications to submit my state taxes for free and followed the link provided by TurboTax. For tax year 2011, anyone who qualifies for EITC or is on active duty military with an AGI of $57,000 or less or has an AGI of $31,000 or less can use TurboTax Online Tax Freedom Edition. I followed their instructions at their website. I selected "I qualify start now." I began filling in the information they were requesting, then I got to a page asking for a credit card, which confused me. So I hesitantly submitted it, because one cannot continue with the filing until you do so. Then I went to the next page to continue my tax filing. Moments later, I received an email which thanked me for my $29.63 payment, when I had not even completed the filing process. I immediately called the 800 number provided to me and spoke with a woman, Colleen, who told me flat out that payments to TurboTax are non refundable, period. And because I had previously used TurboTax to file my free federal form, the software swept me out of Tax Freedom into Turbo Tax basic. So I was duped, and so are hundreds or possibly thousands of other people who also happened to be in the low-income tax bracket and can't afford this nonsense. I'm in dispute through my bank, but I doubt they will have success because Colleen was a complete imbecile. Her job is to make sure callers know that TurboTax does not give refunds. And she will not transfer you to a supervisor and does not care if you were tricked by the software.
I filed online with TurboTax. After 6 weeks and still no check, I went online and gave all the info they asked for and found out they had no record of ever sending or receiving my tax info. Yet I have a confirmation where they took my $59.15. When you call the number it tells you to call; it then tells you to go to the same website that gave you the number. I ended up paying another tax agency to redo it and they said that I did nothing wrong, it was TurboTax that didn't send it in. It was less than 10 days after the other agency done it right that I got my refund. Now, all I want is my money back that they debited from my debit card.
TurboTax incomplete tax preparation - I used TurboTax software for many years to prepare my taxes. I trusted them and recommended the product to friends. This year, I hired someone to do my taxes and have discovered that TurboTax did not prepare required informational forms for IRS for past years. TurboTax did not advise in tax preparation process that these forms are required. Now, I need to pay to have taxes redone for past years to include these forms and may be liable to large fines to IRS, even though I declared all income and filed taxes for past years.
This year TurboTax 2011 software pressures customers to buy the $19.95 e-file for State Tax returns. If you don't buy the option, the software just "drops" any further assistance, including instructions for filing by paper. It is a reminder of what Intuit did many years ago to lose a large percentage of their customers. The company this year is once more using greed over any honor to their long term customers.
State and federal return issues - I am a dissatisfied customer and have had several problems with Turbo Tax. One being my state tax return was supposed to be eFiled and was, however, sent to me by mail. The largest problem I am having is that Turbo Tax states their calculations are 100% accurate and guaranteed, but my federal refund was over a thousand dollars less than what it was guaranteed at. My federal tax return was guaranteed at $2,302, however, only $1,164 was deposited to my checking account.
I started filing my taxes online with TurboTax. I stopped halfway through. Two weeks later, when I tried to finish my 2011 taxes, I discovered someone else had already filled for a refund using my SS and date of birth with a different address. I suspect my identity was stolen through TurboTax. When I contacted their live chat service, they told me to call IRS and didn't help me at all. I have read plenty of news articles about several people filing taxes with this company and complaining about the same issue.
I ordered the Fidelity discounted online version of TurboTax for the federal return only. Bill should have been roughly $35 but I was charged way over $65 on my Visa card. In other words, they charged me for the state return which I did not order or download. Worst of all, however, I am finding numerous errors and omissions, eight major errors on one page alone. Plus, they charge an additional $37 for answering one question even though they advertise free help and info! Except for Dell, this is by far the worst company I have ever dealt with! And they apparently are getting away with all this!
I used my TurboTax card once. It is closed now and I can't get my money. There are no explanations.
After being lied to about my tax return, chatting to several, they had promised to refund preparation fees. I was told they would be taken from return, but they were. I inquired again, then I was told I would get the money back within two weeks after I receive my return which did not happen. I inquired again, now I am being told it would be 4-8 weeks before I would get prep fees returned with less than I was told. Does anyone at Turbo Tax knows anything? They are paying people to just say ** to people. What kind of business is this that can not live up to its commitment? I will never, ever use or recommend them to anyone.
The last two years, 2010 and 2011, I filed my taxes through TurboTax online with the free addition. I owed money and went through the steps it told me to set up payments. I picked out how much I wanted taken out of my account and when to take it out. Needless to say, my payments were never taken out. The last two years I owed and the never took my payments out of my account. I will never use them again as I fear I will have issues with the IRS over this. I will be going to a tax professional to do this year's and take care of the last two years and to look into why my payments never were automatically withdrawn like I had set up. TurboTax has horrible issues that people can't afford to run into. After all, taxes aren't something the IRS will take lightly.
Although I had completed my 2011 S-Corporation tax return using the Turbo Tax business software. I was unable to submit it using the e-file option due to some technical Turbo Tax software error. For many days, I have tried to do it. However, I always got the same message "error code 02 internet issues". Even after I have followed all the instructions on their website to correct a possible cause, being that my internet is working perfectly, trying to get a Live Chat to solve the problem was impossible. As a result, I had to print and file my tax return by mail. That is ridiculous. I lost my time and my money.
I filed my taxes with TurboTax and was told that my refund would be deposit into my account on February 8, 23 and March 9. How it is April 10? I did my tax on January 26, which should take 14 days, not 3 months if I get it then. I pay to get my taxes back in 14 day not 3 months. They charge me over $139.00 for this year and last year also. I 'am very mad at TurboTax and not satisfied with them.
TurboTax advertises that they have "tax professionals" to help you with all of your tax questions. Last year, I used the program and because I didn't need help, it worked fine for me. This year however, I had a question. It was 1 sentence and would have been a no-brainer for a true tax professional. I could not find a phone number anywhere on the site and the "Ask a Tax Expert" button did not work. I finally googled "phone number for TurboTax". I was then tossed around the Philippines to 4 different people who could barely speak English much less give tax advice. When I finally got someone in the US, it took 4 minutes to research what I was asking. Next year I'll be finding a new online program. There is no number on their site to call even though it says all over the site, "Talk to a tax professional by phone." I told the young lady who finally answered my question that I was upset and why. She continued to tell me about all the wonderful services they offer. I asked her what good it does if there's no way to call. She said, "Umm, it is difficult to locate our number on the site.” I asked her where exactly it was and she could not answer that question. Find someone else to do your taxes if you think you may have a question!
I called Turbo tax to let them know about the fraudulent tax return made with my SSN and spoke with two supervisors, who stated quite clearly that even knowing it was identity theft, they would not do anything about the situation. In essence, acting complicit with the criminal who filed taxes under my name and SSN. They did not offer to investigate, report it or anything. Quite simply, "oh well, we have lax security. Our field is software, not security". I have the emails from Turbo Tax. I recorded the phone calls. I am shocked that a company that deals with as sensitive information as SSN, tax IDs, etc. is allowed to have such lax security and no policies in place to deter fraud. If these were health information, many people would be up in arms!
I did my taxes with TurboTax online on January 30, 2012. I was excited to see that I was getting a very large federal return. H&R Block was offering a free second look at tax returns so I had them look over my TurboTax filing. Well, TurboTax put my small pension in as a withholding along with my federal withholding. I answered all the questions TurboTax asked me, rechecked all my information I typed in and don't know why this mistake was made or why it wasn't flagged as a possible mistake. So I had to pay back most of the federal return that I received and had to pay H&R Block to amend my federal and state tax return for 2011. I tried to reach someone in TurboTax to complain but wasn't able to reach anyone. I ended sending People Media a complaint and have never heard back from anyone. I will not use TurboTax again and would not recommend it to anyone.
I filed two tax returns (mine and another) with TurboTax. I was overcharged for the amount I requested and requested that all four returns to be bank deposited. The state returns have been issued via mail. The federal returns have not been received, but I'm guessing they will be by check as well.
The Free federal e-file cost me $39.95, then the program said they allowed 1 free state e-file, which then cost me $19.95. A total of $59.90 for what was advertised to be free.
I filed my taxes for 2010 through TurboTax without a problem. This year when I started TurboTax, my previous year’s personal information was imported but our SSN are incorrect. I checked last year’s printed forms and verified the information was right. Since this was appears to be a TurboTax security breach, I am very concerned about using any Intuit tax preparation program. I have used TurboTax for several years without problems, but something is seriously wrong with the security of confidential information. I will be preparing our tax return this year on paper forms.
We filed TurboTax for 2010 and 2011. We were supposed to get approximately $4000 back from our 2010 filing, and we only received $1855 because TurboTax had it configured to pay our estimated taxes for 2011. We called Turbo Tax and they told us to talk to the State of Virginia. The State of Virginia refused to refund the rest of the money. My wife was on a leave of absence for 9 months with her mother who was dying. We depended on that income and did not receive it. This year we contacted TurboTax reps to prevent this from happening with the 2011 return, two hours on the phone. This time TurboTax took 2/3 of our refund as estimated Virginia taxes. We were supposed to get a refund of $3555. We received $1700 in our bank account. Please make it stop! We will never use TurboTax again! Don't use it! They're screwing us all over.
I filed my taxes on January 24; it was accepted on the 25th. The IRS says it was deposited on the 1st of February. My bank never received it. It is now March 9th. I called TurboTax after being transferred 6 times; I still don't have my money or any information. They tell me to call their bank. That isn't going to do me any good. So you stole my money, which I worked hard for. I will bad mouth TurboTax to anyone and everyone. Nobody will help. Then to get Indians who can't speak English and always interrupt when I am trying to tell them is even more angering. You people are the worst; I guess it's time to get a lawyer.
I have been calling and talking to many TurboTax card reps and have been getting the runaround about my card. First, it was address issues then I was told by a rep my card would be resent last Friday March 2nd or the following Monday March 5th. Today, March 9th, I called to find out when I would be getting my card and they said they just sent it out today, March 9th, which means I was lied to by a rep and the 7-10 days wait is just what I'm being told and not what will happen. I also paid for the express card so I can get it faster but thus far express takes way longer than receiving it through regular mail so I paid the fee for nothing. I have bills that need to get paid with my refund money and I cannot pay them until I get my card. If I do not receive my card, an account # or a way from TurboTax to get my funds into my account or by today, March 9th 2012, I will file a lawsuit because this is a business I went through and they have broken the agreements countless times. I'm very displeased with the customer service and the fact that I see other similar complaints isn't helping anything either. TurboTax, get your stuff together and stop blaming everyone else for your mistakes!
TurboTax gave me my card in the mail and told me it would be available and it's not by the stated time they gave me. Every time I call in, they tell me to call the IRS. They give me my account information and tell me it's not their fault the IRS has processing delays. The IRS 'Where's my refund tool?' says it was deposited on the 23rd of February and I would understand as all banks hold the money for a few days but not two weeks. I'm beginning to think they are trying to run away with my money. I'm only 20 and it's not much money. What to do?
My funds were deposited to my TurboTax on January 26 and it is March 8 and still has not been able to get access to my money. I called several times to TurboTax only to either be hung up on or simply given the run around. This is just ridiculous. I want my money.
The IRS deposited my funds on February 1st. I have not received my money yet. I call TurboTax everyday and I'm getting the run-around. I am an old woman. I don’t make much. I need my money. Can someone help me, please?
I did my taxes on February 7, 2012. It is now March 7, I have had two cards never received, returned undeliverable as addressed. I verified my address every time I called and they never updated 'Apt. #2' on it. TurboTax itself is great customer service. However your Intuit Card Service Department is horrible. I have been answering inbound customer service calls for sales departments for 10 years now, I have the experience to know...politely, they suck. I called today March 7, and was refused a supervisor after re-questioning for 10 minutes for one to be put on the phone. The agent refused to give me her rep ID and name. She just kept saying she doesn't have to give me that. I hung up and called back. I asked for free express and they denied it, then I said, “I do not want to deal with you, just charge the $19.95 so I can get a tracking number and be done with you guys.” The supervisor (I got when I called back) told me he could not express it because it was ordered at first regular mail. So my question is, how come my company ships packages for $7.95 regular post office, and every one comes with a delivery confirmation number, but a federal tax refund card with hundreds of dollars doesn't? It's ridiculous. I am also sending a request to refund the $96.22 I paid you to do my taxes. I did taxes for almost 20 people for you this year, they all received theirs. I will never use TurboTax again. My resolution from them was, “We'll send a request to get the express waived and sent, if not, it's coming regular mail,” again with no tracking number, to the same address because they can't send it to my work.
I filed my taxes through TurboTax this year for my 2011 taxes. It was recommended in order for me to receive my refund faster to select to use the TurboTax refund card. Under the assumption that I would, of course, this is the option that I chose. It has been over a month and my refund money from the IRS has been deposited but I have no TurboTax refund card. I was told that I have a security hold on my account only after I called to see why I still have no card. After following their instructions to get this lifted (faxing my id, lease, and social security card), I still have no Turbo Tax refund card. I called to see if they received the fax, their words were yes, but it takes 5-7 days for us to note it on your account. Well, of course, this time has passed so I called again. I was told, "Your licensed is too dark, please fax again." I faxed again. This time frame has lapsed again, still no Turbo Tax refund card. I had called yet again and was given a different number to fax to. I was told that my card would be expedited at this point. Well, I've faxed it five times. Still, it hasn't been updated on my account. I called back today and the CSR told me that my card was mailed out on 02/29 and I would receive it between 03/08-03/12. I called back to make sure I wasn't misinformed yet again. To my surprise, I was. My account has not been updated, they have not received any fax, the card has not been mailed out, nor is it on the expedite list. I have been on hold now for an hour trying to speak to a supervisor to get this resolved.
I was filing my taxes today, and had a question about Retirement Savings Contributions. On my first call, the customer service representative kept thinking and guiding me to Pension Income Claims. I repeated my question over and over, and he just did not understand what I was saying. English is a second language in my home as well, but I feel that when it comes to customer service, people who are fluent in English would be a better fit for the job! It is extremely frustrating when you're constantly being steered in the wrong direction! It is even harder when you can barely understand what the representative is trying to say! To be honest, I don't even want to use Turbo Tax anymore, because I can't seem to get help when I need it!
I purchased both deluxe and business. I got NJ free but now I was told it's $20 to file NJ, $40 to download WI and $20 more to file WI. It's too much and will not recommend TurboTax to anyone asking.
Can't eFile: I paid $120 for TurboTax for Corporations. The PDF converter for the required signature did not work. There were 8 calls ahead of me on the help line, and they closed in 20 minutes. I ended up faxing in to get the PDF version of the signature, and then there was an error in the body of the file even though you run the review and no errors found. It would not eFile. I ended up printing and mailing, which defeats the purpose of paying to eFile our return.
TurboTax Scam: I paid TurboTax fees to process my refund. I received my refund on February 6, 2012. After 4 days, my card was closed by the company for security review. I was advised by customer service to submit my identification, my signed Social Security card, and a utility bill via fax. I did so the very same night. A week later, I was told my ID was not clear enough and until I submitted the proof again, my funds would not be released. I repeated the steps 7 more times, and still, a month later I'm without my refund. I'm in debt, I'm due to move next week with no money, and my car is down. I just want my money, and all the fees associated with my refund. TurboTax is running a scam. I have very sensitive information out there who knows where, and they're playing games.
I am very dissatisfied with my recent experience with TurboTax. My husband and I attempted to e-file our federal and Illinois state taxes and everything appeared to be fine. A few hours later, we received a rejection notification for our state taxes. Since we have never done our taxes on our own before, I immediately contacted TurboTax before anybody else as this is the company that we were using to file. They told me there was a glitch in our state, that several people were being rejected, and that I had no choice but to mail my tax forms in. I didn't know any better, and thought this company knew what they were doing. I printed the forms and it continued to state that even through the mail we would have our refund direct deposited in 7-14 days. We were also charged $19.95 to e-file. After 5 weeks of the Illinois IRS website stating they had not received my tax forms that I had printed, I called the Illinois IRS to find out what was going on. I was told that TurboTax completely misguided me, that I should have contacted the state to correct the problem, and continued to e-file, as there was no glitch in my state. Now I have to wait approximately 16 weeks (4 months) to receive my refund. Next year, I will be going back to my tax professional.
I thought TurboTax was free for 1040 EZ filers? I completed my 1040EZ form and was charged $71.59. I worked part time and went to school full time and certainly don't feel like I should have to pay $71.59 for an EZ form, especially when it is advertised as free.
Philippines Service Center: I just experienced my worst experience ever with TurboTax support staff; to say I'm dissatisfied puts it mildly. I've been a loyal customer of this company since ChipSoft became TurboTax several decades ago. I called the 800 service number and had a frustrating experience with one of your service representatives in the Philippines, as I asked him where he was located. The representative could not speak clear English, did not understand if the TurboTax 2012 disk covered the 2011 tax year, and also did not understand the Advantage program. The supervisor I requested spoke clear English, but could not transact my debit card through his system. I became suspicious when he asked me to repeat all my personal and card information, so I stopped giving him information. Per the supervisor's directions I ended up going online to the main TurboTax website and ordered my 2011 Home & Business CD, having to pay the shipping charges that were offered free by the supervisor. TurboTax needs to train their overseas support centers better. They should be able to enunciate English words clearly. Service is going downhill fast. Please improve or I will move onto a different company. Thank you.
My husband is unavailable to speak with TurboTax but I have a Power of Attorney. Our refund was placed on the wrong account because of a mistake my husband made. I contacted them and asked to have a contact number to submit my Power of Attorney. Jessica and her supervisor both informed me there was nothing I could do, no address, no phone number or anything. I waited on hold only to be told there was no one there of higher authority to talk to. So women, beware, if you file a joint return, you have no rights to the funds with TurboTax even when you have all the legal documents to prove it.
I think I can help everyone with the TurboTax card. This number may help: 858-215-8542. I called and they are sending me a new card. What happened to me was they said they sent a card I never got, so they sent another one. When I got that card there was a security block on it. After a few days it was off, but card said a DD was made on Feb. 5 for $984. However, the IRS DD my money on Feb. 8 for $930. The routing number and account number for the card they sent did not match with where the IRS DD my money to the card. They also said a zero balance on it, but it had no transaction history. Call this number. They helped me. I hope I will find out when I get new card.
I filed my taxes. IRS deposited the money into a TurboTax debit card on 02/07. I called TurboTax because I had not received the card. They told me the card was on a security hold. I questioned why they would hold it and not IRS? It is now 21 days later, and I have faxed every document to them, including what there website says was deposited to the card from IRS. I was still told wait 7 to 10 more days. Are they going to pay me the interest they are earning? Are they going to pay the late charges I have from late rent with possible eviction? What a scam.
On January 30, I filed my taxes using TurboTax. The email I was sent said I would receive my card by February 8, 2012. When I called to check, I was told to wait until Friday, the 10th. Friday, the 10th, came; and there's no card. I called TT back and was told the card was never mailed out and that my account had been placed on security review. So I faxed over the info they asked for: driver's license, SS number, and utility bill. On February 14, I called and was told the info had been received and I had to wait 5-7 business days. Fine, I can wait. I called every few days to check in and was told several times the info had been received and was being worked on. On February 22, I called back again (7 business days) and was told the info had never been received. So I faxed it again. Today, February 28, they called me to say the copies were too dark and I had to re-fax. Add to the the 30+ wait times on hold the constant lies and aggravation. I finally found this website and called Bankcorp and am waiting for a call back.
I received my refund as expected, so I can't complain about that. However, I went to a resort and authorized room service, which I did not use. Apparently, they place a hold on my account for $108. The day I left which was on February 13, the hold was released. I even called the hotel to confirm this. So I called up Turbo Tax Card's customer service. That was the first time I waited for 30 minutes. Then, the recording stopped but I was not transferred to a representative. I called up again, waited for 20 minutes, and the representative informed me that when a hold is placed on the card it takes up to 30 days to remove it. "Really? But why?" I asked but the representative couldn't tell me. "It's just policy" was his only response. Why is my money being held hostage? I have never had this problem with any other prepaid card or bank account. If I knew this in advance, I would have deposited my money onto another card. There is absolutely no reason for this. Are they just too busy to take the hold of, as they are to answer phone calls? This is unacceptable. I also opted to take the survey which was supposed to happen after the call, and they didn't let me do that either. I already told them how horrible their customer service is on their website feedback form. I wanted to do it by phone too! They don't even have a customer service e-mail address, so whenever you need something you have to waste precious minutes of your life on hold waiting for some incompetent to tell you what you don't want to hear. I was very disappointed. I used to recommend this service to everyone, and now I am doing the opposite.
Their customer service put me on hold forever then they hung up on me many times. They took my money for the state taxes but then couldn't file them by e-filing and there's no way to contact them. They made an error on their part on ss number where the return was rejected because they messed up - not us! I keep getting the runaround. It's awful.
They don't keep their word. They got their fee, and a month after the IRS released my refund, I still haven't gotten it. I tried calling the customer service, but put me on hold for 30 minutes on two different occasions, and did not answer.
On 2/21/12, I tried to e-file my 2011 taxes. I got a message that it was a duplicate, and it would not go through. I called Turbo Tax. They advised me that on 1/19/12, someone filed a Federal and State tax return using my name and SS number. I've spent many hours on the phone with IRS fraud unit, Federal Trade Commission, the Police Department, Bank, and the credit bureaus. Now I probably won't be able to get my refund this year! Turbo Tax accepts no liability. All they did was give me an email address for the person who hacked my account. The best part is I'm married and have been for 20 years. The person filed using only my information. It is not fair. I can't get my refund because now they have to do investigation while someone got away with taking my information, getting refund under my name and SS number. I wish I never used Turbo Tax. The sad thing is I've used it for years. I think they should be responsible for someone getting into the account and taking my information. They tell you everything is secure.
I am going through the same scam as we speak. They are claiming that they mail a cashier’s check which was never delivered and never returned back to them. It has been 23 days since the IRS released my refunds and TPG Santa Barbara now has perfected their scam by imposing 11 working days delay prior to sending you their stupid "I-bond form" to re-initiate the process all over which advises you that it could take an upward of 90 days to receive the second check and they are refusing to simply put the money on a prepaid debit card which they can do as confirmed by their CS supervisor! The discrepancy regarding the first cashier check having been given two different mailing dates previously; Feb 06 and Feb 07-2012 by two customer service agents cast a cloud of suspicious as to the credibility of both agents and Santa Barbara Tax Products Group/University Bank policies. Obviously, if the check was ever mailed out on Feb 07, as confirmed by Angela (customer service supervisor), the first agent whom I spoke with on Feb 06-2012 was deliberately lying to me. He clearly affirmed that the check was mailed out to me that same day, Monday Feb 06-2012 while reading the transaction on his computer and told me to wait 3 to 4 business day to receive the check before he abruptly hanged up on me. Why would an agent clearly lie, if it’s not the company’s? The second lie I caught the agent on was when he stated that a previously check mail out to me had returned back to them. It was the reason for the delay. When I asked why I didn’t receive my refund yet. I had to correct him for the fact that I was issued a debit card by TurboTax which was suddenly closed for no apparent reason as soon as the IRS accepted my income tax application. Disappointed by the poor service, I asked the agent which company was I dealing with and he informed me that they were the University Bank. Five days later, on Friday Feb 10-2012, the second agent Damian will give me the Feb 07-2012 mailed out date as I was inquiring on the where about of the so-call cashier’s check which I never received for all suitable purposes and conveniently to Santa Barbara Tax Products Group and Turbo Tax benefit. Despaired, I ask Damian which company they were. With so much inconsistency, he would tell me that it was Santa Barbara Tax Products Group. At this point, I knew I was in for the ride of the worse experience ever. Agents giving me different mailing dates, different company’s name, it is the Epitome of the most unorganized and blunt scam I have yet to witness in my life. When I reported my concern to Angela, she was very humored by my confusion and had a good laugh about it, while I was seriously astonished of the level of unprofessionalism of this company. It’s apparent that with hundreds of TurboTax customers complaining online for the same problem that this is indeed a scam, coordinated by TurboTax and Santa Barbara Tax Products Group. The reason why Santa Barbara Tax Products Group is not mailing checks and prolonging re-issuing second check is for one purpose and one purpose only! Make money both for themselves and TurboTax, their partner. It’s simple economics, the farther out Santa Barbara Tax Products hold paying out clients the higher interest these forcefully held funds accrues at their bank, and is free money for them. Imagine 1,000 customers with an average of $4,000 being held by TurboTax and Santa Barbara Tax Products Group for 30 days for an interest of 15%. That’s $600, 000.00. I will generate for them $600, 000.00 free money simply by holding other people’s money. It’s cruel but it doesn’t get any better than that! We must hold both Santa Barbara Tax Products Group and TurboTax accountable for this scam. Let organize people we have Twitter, Facebook, Myspace and the press on our side. We need to coordinate our effort and advice friends not to use TurboTax ever! Email me at **. On the subject box, please mark TurboTax. Let’s give TurboTax much needed bad press as much as possible.
I signed up to get my Federal and State Tax refunds to be direct deposited into a new account with TurboTax and gain access to the refunds with a Visa debit card that would be sent to me in the mail. I completed my 2011 tax returns with the online Turbo Tax software. This is my 4th year using this service and this is the first time I have had this problem. I received the Visa debit card (# **) in the mail and tried to activate it online and over the phone but kept getting an error message saying I'm not entering the correct info. I called the customer service # on the back of the Visa debit card and spoke with a rep and explained the situation. It was determined that the social security # associated with the account was not correct. I explained to the rep how and why I set up the Visa debit account and explained that there must be some error because my tax return and the IRS have the correct SS#. I know this because I created an account with TurboTax 4 years ago. When I log in to my account certain info (name, address, SS#, etc.), download automatically from one of the previous returns and fills in certain spots on the online tax return. It asks you if the info is correct. Also if the SS# was wrong on the tax return, my e-filing request would not have been accepted. Also, when you choose how you want to file and receive your refund, you have multiple chose questions, so the SS# is already on the return and you don't load in any SS info. Somehow, the SS# received by the company handling the direct deposit, University National Bank (which is a new company that TurboTax is using this year) received the wrong SS# for me. I was transferred to the TurboTax Security Review Dept. and was told I need to fax a copy of my SS card, my driver’s license, and my apartment rental lease to phone# 800-506-4836. I did what was requested of me. After calling numerous times at all hours of the day and night to see if the info was received, I finally spoke with a rep 3 days later after being on hold for over 30 minutes at 12 midnight and was told that the record shows that the proper info was received on Feb. 7, 2012 and it would take 7-10 business days to fix the problem. In the meantime, the IRS website is saying my refund will be deposited on Feb 8, but I wouldn't be able to access the money because the account is closed/on hold because of the SS# issue. I received a check from TurboTax card for the federal refund with added fees taken out, because of this problem. I called TurboTax card several times to complain about the added fees because I paid a fee already to have the refund direct deposited, but never I got a chance to ask those questions. When I did speak to someone finally after being on hold for 45 minutes and being hung up on and 38 minutes and being disconnected again in the middle of the conversation, I was told the hold had been lifted on the card but the SS# had not been changed on the card and I would have to refax the same info I earlier faxed and had already been received. I have spent a lot of time on hold or dialed the customer service # on numerous occasions and got a recording saying the lines are backed up and try your call again later. I have spent extra monies on check cashing fees and faxing fees and taxi fees (to go to fax the info) trying to get this matter resolved. My state refund was scheduled to be deposited to this same account, but has since been returned to the state and a check is scheduled to be mailed to me on March 1. Now, I have to spend more money to get this check cashed because of this mess. I'm tired and I want this problem fixed. I feel I have been so inconvenienced by this that all the fees that were taken from my federal refund should be refunded to me. I'm fed up and if I don't get a favorable resolution, I will not be using TurboTax for my 2012 tax preparation.
I've had the same problem as everyone else with them saying my funds are being held and my card for security reasons. I faxed my stuff 3 different times, still no use. So I've done some research and here's what will help you. Follow me on twitter at **. From there, you can log into a class action lawsuit or through Facebook! Let's take them down! First, you will call 1-877-554-2339, this is the customer service line for Bancorp. If there is a wait time, they have a nifty call back feature which gets them back to you within minutes, not waiting hours to talk to TurboTax! Second, you can opt to fax your documents to Bancorp directly at 605-988-3346 or email your scanned copies to operations@thebancorp.com. Either way, wait 2 business days and call back 1-877-554-2339 and prompt in to the option that says, "If you are checking on documents that we requested you send to us, press X." You may have to call in a few days in a row, but start at 2 business days. It should be no more than 5 business days. Once they have the documents, your hold will be released and your funds are all clear.
After completing all tax forms and e-filing, I needed to print copies of both my federal and state returns. It was a dead end! I spent over 2 hours trying to print copies, using all of the site's suggestions, and a few of my own. There is no number to call for help. I guess if you need an "expert" help for a fee. You have that option. The program doesn't work as advertised, so don't feel I should have to pay extra. I paid for my service via American Express. If no assistance is rendered, American Express is very good about not paying the vendor. H&R Block is more expensive, but I have never had issues with them.
They mailed me a card to access my refund only to find that the card was closed and all they kept saying is that is was a security problem.
Scam!...Liars...Frauds!- I wish I would have read all these reviews before I used this dumb ass card! I have a card I could have deposited it on but instead I wanted to try something new, what a big mistake! I have money they are holding and talking 'bout 30 days this and 30 days that! Never had this type of issue with H&R then they have no reviews on their website! It took forever for me to find somewhere to post a complaint! I asked Turbo Tax, how do I place a complaint they told me there was a P.O. Box I could write. Are you serious? This big fraudulent company you mean to tell me a PO BOX is all you have? This is ridiculous and the hold times on for the customer service department is the worst! I have been on hold for over 2 hours in the last 24 hours, it's crazy! I would never recommend Turbo Tax to a soul. As a matter fact, I'm writing the BBB right after this review not to mention I will most definitely let all 1,000 of my Facebook friends and Twitter followers know what a scam this is!
This is since January 29, when my e-file through TT was accepted. It is now past the 6-week period, and TT will not answer my questions. And Intuit is a joke. This is the last time I will ever go to them. It's back to Block and their higher cost but better services. Did you know that those who e-filed with Block have already begun receiving their refunds? Your tax return has been received and is being processed. If you file a complete and accurate tax return, your refund will be issued within six weeks of the received date.
I completed my taxes on 2/2/2012 and was accepted the same day. My federal tax return was deposited into Santa Barbara Tax Group on 2/21/2012. On 2/22/2012, I saw that the money was not on my TurboTax Card. I called customer service who transferred me to an automated message stating that the card was closed. After calling 2 more times and the customer support transferring me to the automated message, I called again demanding to not be transferred to the same message. The customer representative did not give me a reason as to why my card was closed or how to resolve the issue. Customer support told me to simply wait for the IRS to send a check. I have filed with the Better Business Bureau and I’m looking into a class action lawsuit. The card cost a total of $56.90 and I want a refund from all services.
Their software doubled line 71 in my W-2 entry. I filed a claim, then the IRS has charged me. Now, I owe over $5300 in back taxes, penalties, and interest. Help.
Well, like many of you I used TurboTax and signed up for the card. The confirmation email said it would take until the 16th of February. When it didn't show up (emails and phone calls show the government was quite effective even with the delay warnings and the account values have been loaded to the account) by then I called and was reassured (after waiting on hold almost an hour) that it would be here by the 21st, which is still later than they advertised. Now after calling back again when it still didn't show (only about a 30 minute wait this time) they will send me a new one (another 7-10 day wait if this one actually shows up) or I can PAY to have it FedEx? I have read several complaints similar to this and it hit me, they are intentionally doing this so you will call back desperate and they can get the extra 20 bucks out of you, which they "conveniently" can deduct from the new card you have to wait for, which seems like since they sent a confirmation date they didn't live up to shouldn't they pay to fix the mistake? I will never use them again and if anyone can elaborate on this subject, if it could be proven they are doing this would possible legal action be in order, because from what I've seen this is happening to tens of thousands of people this year. Pretty sad when a government bureaucracy is more efficient and competent than a private business.
Money was taken out of my account at 7-11. On 2-14-2012, I went to 7-11 at the 800 Block of Sycamore St, Petersburg, VA 23803 to get a cigar and $3.00 back in cash. I had $4.41 in my TurboTax refund card. The cashier said that the card had been declined, but I had just checked the card before I went the store. Now I can't get into my account.
Turbo tax without any warning is holding my husbands money hostage! His taxes were deposited on the 14th of Feb, I called them on the 20th to see where his card was. They verified him and that they could talk to me and then told me that because they arbitrarily pick on customers, his name was picked as "possibly fraudulent" and we would have to fax them further information to reopen the card for use. This is BS in my opinion, why did they never tell me that and why if you just spoke to him and he was cleared to let you talk to me. Why the hell is that not good enough for you to open his card! I asked if I could just change it to be deposited into his checking account, no of course not then they could not get the interest off his money that way. I mean, it's ridiculous that they cannot just verify him over the phone. Honestly, I am not comfortable sending them any information at this point. How do we know that his personal information is safe going to such a shady company? But they give you no other choice. It's either send them the info or wait some undetermined amount of time for them to close the card and then 14 days later, you will get the check. If I wanted to wait, I would have paper files you jerks!
Filed taxes on 2-2-12 and was suppose to receive money between 2-9-12 thru 2-12-12. I ended up having a hold on my card, sent my info through fax on 2-11-12 then my card ended up saying that it was closed. I kept calling TurboTax for help and nobody could tell me anything. IRS sent money, a direct deposit on 2-21-12 and because of the TurboTax issue, I will not be receiving anything for another month and on top of that, turbo tax still collects their fees... Not fair at all.
I was accidentally charged by a hotel; it was $940.78, and they refunded the money back to card and had authorization code doing so. And now, TurboTax say it's the merchant's policy that it will take 30 days to get my money back. But the hotel says it's TurboTax playing with money and still have yet to get my money back. Also, my kid's father said he got his card and they closed it due to security purposes and asked him to send all this stuff. And they said money will be on in 5 days, and when he checked, it's still not there. And then they request more stuff to be sent and keep stringing him along now for a month, and he still hasn't got his money. This is illegal, and it's wrong what they are doing to people, so they can gain interest off holding people's money. I want to file a class action lawsuit against them.
This is a fairly minor complaint in that I did not actually lose any money, but I have been unable to use TurboTax's Tax Freedom edition to submit my state taxes, even though I qualify and after specifically accessing the site through my state's Department of Revenue link. I went in using that link, got to the end and to proceed with submitting my state tax return I was asked to pay $27.95. I've been using the TurboTax Tax Freedom edition for several years and even if I had initially used the wrong link, I was always able to go in through the correct link and still file my state taxes using the Tax Freedom edition until this year.
I, along with many people have had problems with TurboTax. I have used them for the past 4 or 5 years now. I filed my taxes back in late January and I had my refund on my card by Feb 14. But now, my card has been closed and I'm pretty upset about it. That was my money and I'm not sure why they can get away with holding my money from me. I'm not sure what else to do. If someone can help me figure out, I would greatly appreciate it. I will never again use TurboTax and will never recommend them to anyone. They are nothing but tax frauds.
I filed my taxes through Turbo Tax Online on January 28th and opted for the Turbo Tax card to have my funds deposited on. I received the card on Feb 2nd. It would not activate saying that the card was closed. When I called the # on the back, I was told there was a security breach and to fax all my info to a number. I did. They told me it would be a few days. I saw that the IRS had deposited my money on Feb. 6, so I checked my card. It still was closed. When I called the line, no one would tell me any info except that a security breach had occurred. The IRS just confirmed for the second time that the money was deposited into a Turbo Tax account. The IRS said to call the police for possible theft and fraud which I have done. And every day that I call, I still keep getting the run around. I have kept a log of info and if I had the money, I would throw a lawsuit at them. But my husband is out of work and money has been extremely tight. We have no food to eat, are getting behind in bills, and have a tire that I have to fill up daily with air because it has a leak. We have been having breathing problems because I work 60 hours a week and spent hours and hours trying to find my money. I hope my tire can make it through till I can find this money or I will not have transportation to my job.
I have been informed that I would receive my taxes on the 17th of Feb., which is the same time I would receive my Turbo Tax card. Needless to say, my refund was deposited, but I received no card, and the 17th marked the 10th day within the time frame Turbo Tax allowed for me to receive my card. I called, and was informed that my card has a security code placed on the account. Turbo Tax notified me, and informed me that I would receive my card within 7-10 business days, but why was I not notified via email, that there was a security code placed on the account. This would have allowed me enough time to submit in the required info to have my money, when the IRS deposited it. I feel really violated by Turbo Tax, to make this inappropriate decision of not notifying me. This was a first time use of a Turbo Tax card, and I would never use or recommend them. I spoke with a rep and a supervisor by the name of Anthony, who could only tell me that the internal department placed the code on the account, I can't speak with the internal department, and that there is no one that he could call or speak to in reference to my call. This company is garbage. Once they receive my requested/required documents, it will take another 5 days to process, then another 3 days to receive my card through FedEx. I guess they are in control, cause they have what you need. This is a poor way to conduct business, and as I see it, this is just how they handle their business. I would never recommend, or use their services again.
I filed my federal taxes at the end of January 2012. By the way, this is my 3rd year using TurboTax. After I was done, I decided to use their TurboTax card just so my refund will not get mixed in with my paycheck funds. Well, my taxes were accepted by the IRS and in about 5 days the card came in the mail. When I tried to activate it through the website, it said that the card was closed or something, so I called the customer service # on the back of the card. The gentleman told me that for security reasons, I needed to mail in my SS card, proof of residence and ID. This was on February 5th. So on February 8th, I faxed the information to them and called back on February 12th (Sunday). The gentleman that I spoke to then stated that if the IRS had deposited the money into my account with them (I suppose the one that they set up through their bank) and the account was on hold, the money could not be placed in the account and that I would need to call the IRS to have them deposit it into another account. Well I called the IRS the next day and found out that they deposited my taxes on the 6th and even gave me the specific account number that they deposited it into. Well, I then called TurboTax, which like the first two times, took over 45 minutes for me to get a live person. While I was on hold though, I read through the comments on this website and saw the similarities in every single complaint. So, when the lady came on and verified my info, she asked could she be put on hold to read her notes. I told her no since I knew she could probably read them without me being on hold. Well, she preceded to put me on hold and the phone went silent, then music came on, and then a man's voice came on stating that my account was closed and to contact the IRS to get a check mailed to me. Well I called today as well (February 19th) and the another rep went to transfer me to the department that could assist me in my security hold for the card and yet again, another recording like the previous one. Two things will happen if my taxes (which I worked hard for) are not accounted for: 1) The Better Business Bureau will be contacted. 2) I will file fraud through the IRS concerning this matter.
I filed my 2011 federal tax with TurboTax. I made a mistake after I emailed tax to IRS. I tried to get the amended 1040X form to straighten it out to no avail. They were of no help but still I paid $29.95. I ended up going to Liberty Tax to refile a 1040X charged $93. My tax person said I was not the first one this year this happened to. Better yet, the amount I owed previously became a few dollars less than TurboTax figured. They have not returned my credit card amount. Thank you.
I was using the Turbo Tax online free Federal Return. I could not print my work or EFile it without paying for it and automatically I was charged for the state return. If I wanted my taxes processed, I had no choice but to pay the $60 charged to a credit card. There is no way you can get a free return.
I filed on the first and waited the ten days that TT wants you to wait before calling about the card. First rep I talked to just straight lied to me and said it was the IRS that was reviewing my account not TT. Second and third reps I spoke to put me on hold to transfer me to someone that could tell me why they were holding my money. Both came back on the line and told me that no one was available to answer my question but someone would contact me within 24 hours. Both times there was no call back. So finally, this morning, the rep asks me why I haven't sent in the documents they need to clear my account. Because not one of the ** I spoke to ever mentioned faxing any documents. Worst part is it seems that it was intentional. I got the exact same runaround from two of them and one just plain lied to me. It gives the appearance that they are being trained to stall refunds. Something is going on at TT that they don't want the public to know about. Why else misdirect customers and just plain lie about the review? Is TT using our money in some way for their benefit?
I have been using TurboTax for seven years but will never use their products again. After entering my tax info and seeing a refund due, I opted for audit defense, which was an additional $40. Instead of paying for it with a credit card, I decided to use the option to deduct it from my refund. Big mistake. I guess I didn't see the fine print that must state that I will be charged an additional $30 for processing by University National Bank. Wow. After giving them business for buying an additional service (pure profit , since I won't be audited), they reward me by spanking me with another $30 fee. And for what? To deduct $40 from my refund? I could train a monkey to do that for a nice ripe banana. LOL. Stay away from TurboTax!

What happened this year to TurboTax? Are they using a new bank? Seriously! It has never in the past took so long for refunds to be received. At least a dozen or more of my fellow co-workers are very upset as well. Next year, it's going to by Liberty or H&R. They cut you a check right then and there, no waiting weeks and weeks and weeks and with no excuses. Sorry Turbo but your loyal followers are going away next year. Best bet...dump your Intuit stock now.
My card was declined after verifying a $6000 balance. I tried to call for several hours, but I cannot get through. There was no way to email or any other alternate method. I was trying to purchase a car and cannot do so due to this problem. My money is being held hostage!
In previous years, I used H&R Block Tax Cut Deluxe to prepare my income tax returns. This year (2011 tax year), I decided to use TurboTax. I checked TurbTax Deluxe information and they said all necessary information would be transferred from the previous year's tax return. I completed my return and discovered that the Real Estate depreciation information from the previous year return was not transferred and, as a result, I was going to pay several hundred dollars more in tax. I called TurboTax and after being put on hold several times, I was told that only the Premier edition could handle this feature. I told the tech how poor I thought this was and she said she would try to get me a free upgrade to the Premier. She put me on hold again and then came back and told me they wouldn't do the free upgrade. TurboTax did not disclose this problem in any of their literature and unless I had been very diligent, I would have paid more tax than I should. I will never use another Intuit product again.
OK, I know most of you folks are from the USA. But my complaint is just as valid. I have been using TT for a few years now. No probs. This year was a complete disaster. Calling customer service was waste of time. All in India. I could not understand most of what they said. They lied to me and gave me incorrect advice. If I listened to them I would have sent my taxes in wrong. They have no knowledge of Canadian tax system. Their software (this year) is bugged and does not properly add up or even add in the line of Ontario sales tax credits (state tax). I will never use this software or any other from Intuit again. I am filling a complaint to the Better Business Assoc.
I used TurboTax online to prepare my taxes on January 14th 2012. I chose to receive my refund on a TurboTax prepaid visa card. The website stated I will receive my card in 5-7 business days. I received an email January 15th 2012 stating that the card was mailed out and again I should receive it in 5-7 business days. I received an email from the IRS on February 8th stating my refund was deposited into my account (TurboTax card). I still have not received the card as of yet and today is February 16, 2012. I have called TurboTax numerous times and all you get is an automated service that disconnects after keeping you on hold for 20+ minutes. I Google search the question: Has anyone not received their TurboTax card for 2011 and the hits were in the upper 20 thousand, which lets me know that this is not an isolated incident with just me. Are they holding on to individuals refunds to accrue interest for themselves and if so is this legal? Please help!
Turbo Tax Free Online is a misnomer. It is NOT free and shouldn't be advertised as such. Its bait and switch tactics are a sham. You get all the way through the tax questions and go to print to check it out and they want to charge $30. Again, how is that free?
I decided to use TurboTax this year to do my taxes again for the third year. I noticed that they were not the cheapest but the reviews said that they were the easiest, so I decided to go with it. The process took very little time and was easy until it came to the part where I had to netfile it. I followed the suggestions on TurboTax's website exactly but CRA kept complaining that I was not using the right .tax file. After multiple tries, I decided to open the .tax file and compare it to last year to see if something is different. After opening the file with Wordpad, I noticed that the file from last year starts with ISA ** where as the .tax file from this year is completely different and it looks like it's in xml version 1.0 format. I called the support number and after about ten minutes, I was able to get a live person on the phone. I explained twice what my issue was before and to my amazement he asked, "What is the issue you have?" at which point I explained the issue again for the third time. I was then put on hold for about three minutes and on his return, the technician asked me yet again what exactly was the problem and what extension of file I was using. Make the long story short, I had to explain myself about eight or nine times and be put on hold about another ten times before I was told that this is a known issue and that I had to wait for four or five days until the issue is resolved. I then explained to the technician that I did not have that much time to waste and that if their software does not do what it promised to do, then they should give me a refund. To my amazement again, I was told that a refund was not available for the online version. I then asked to speak to a manager, so another five minutes on hold and someone who introduced himself as the manager confirmed that the issue is a known issue and that it should be fixed within a week but in the mean time, they still did not want to refund my money. At this point, I was beyond frustrated and I asked them why they continue to sell the product if it does not work properly and why not make their customers aware of this issue before taking their money. As it stands, I am still having this issue and no one has contacted me back to resolve the issue or refund me my money. I will never ever use any product made by Intuit again and I will leave this feedback on every forum of every website I can get my hands on so that people out there would know what kind of scam QuickTax is and not to buy their bad product. Another frustrating thing is to deal with technicians who do not speak English and have an attitude that suggests that you are not following proper procedure. I am an a Certified Network Engineer and I have been in IT for the past fifteen years of my life. I know how to use Windows or Internet Explorer, so blaming the issue on my computer skills is not going to work.
After filing through TurboTax both my federal and state returns and paying over $70 for this privilege, I was maneuvered into taking a TurboTax Card and having my refund of $2087 deposited into it. There was no warning that I would be charged $2.50 per transaction, that they would charge $5.95 if the balance fell below $50, or that I could only cancel by phone (which they don't answer). They would send the balance within 35 days, allowing them to run into another month, hence charging me another $5.95! I did realize I didn't have to take the card; I could have it direct-deposited to my checking account, so immediately I called them to cancel the card. I was on the phone for 25 minutes, mostly on hold, then i was told to call the IRS. I never could get to the right person at IRS, so I gave up and let the card come and the cash be deposited. I went immediately to the bank to deposit the entire amount to my account, and it would not work, even with the help of the bank manager. There was a $1,000 daily limit to access my money! The site tells my wife who I have on the phone that I can call TurboTax directly, if I want to withdraw more than $1,000. For 30 minutes, they did not answer the phone. I had to do just $1,000 and go back the next day and do another $1,000. And each time, I was charged $2.50 by TurboTax or their bank. It has been impossible to withdraw the rest, though I was able to pay some small transactions with a portion of it. There is over $40 left on the card, and I can't get through on the phone. And if I try an ATM, it tells me my PIN is invalid. I'm so frustrated and angry and feel that TurboTax should be severely penalized and this debit card scam shut down. There are so many complaints about the card online that I am dazzled. I wonder how I could be so stupid as to get sucked in. However, I have Lyme disease which causes neurologic symptoms which is the reason I used a computer program to begin with. I mistakenly thought there was an extra fee if I didn't take the stupid card! No, it was actually if I didn't pay the filing fees in advance. But it wasn't clear at all and is designed easily to suck in all but the most astute user. I will never use them again.
I filed my income tax with TurboTax on January 28th 2012. I was told I would get my TurboTax visa card with in 7-10 days and paid extra for that service, plus a $20 FedEx delivery fee. After 11 days, I checked my refund with the IRS and they issued my refund on February 6th to TurboTax. I then contacted TurboTax only to find out they will not release my money or mail out the visa debit card I paid for because of security reasons. They will not tell me why. I now have to fax them personal information to have my account unlocked and then they claim it will take another week before they will release my income tax and mail the visa card. I'm contacting a lawyer and I hope that we can get a class action lawsuit going against this company for what they are doing to people. In my opinion, they are holding people's money in the bank to collect interest. This is criminal what they are doing to people!
The updating was not proceeded with any warning as to how long it would take. It took over half an hour to complete but I tried to interrupt it and got short messages that something was put in the trash and if I would want to retrieve something. These messages were so short I wasn't sure what was being said. I let the updating finish and then restarted. I looked for data in what I thought were the forms I had filed in November of 2011 and found no data. I then thought all my data had been erased and all I wanted to do was actually talk with a human being who could help me. It was actually my confusion in thinking the updates were for the forms I sent in November 2011 which were actually for tax year 2010! I then found that my 2010 data was intact, and of course, all I had in 2011 was a transfer from 2010 which was there still. While all that was involved was my confusion about paying taxes in one year for data involving the previous year, e.g., this is taxes to be paid in 2012 for the tax year 2011. This I find can be very confusing and I do not think I am the only one. My complaint is that I found it impossible to find any actual telephone number, address, or any way to chat with support from Intuit Turbotax without having to pay money for a so-called expert to give an answer to a question not listed in Turbotax listing of questions that they assume we want to ask. I simply get the impression that, more than any other company I have had to deal with, Turbotax wants to keep its customers at the greatest distance possible instead of providing, after all regular guidance has been tried, a contact with a support person in some way through email, phone call, chat, snail mail, etc. simply because there will always be a question that can be answered in no other way. Otherwise, frustration occurs and one wants to find a company providing better customer service and consideration.
I was issued a TurboTax card, my deposit date was on February 13th and so I called to check my balance when it said my card was closed. I called the customer service line to see what was going on and they told me I had to fax in documentation of my ID social security card and proof of residence, so I did and was. Told to call back today only to be told I was getting a check mailed out to me now. I'm stuck with not having the money to pay my bills that I was suppose to pay yesterday! ** TurboTax will never use again.
I paid $33 for Federal return prep, and my primary goal is to have it e-filed, not submitted by paper. Delays, return for several weeks. However, the software has a glitch on one screen that is automatically choosing an option (it clicks that I received interest from a seller financed mortgage, which I did not) no matter how many times I uncheck it. It comes back. Thus the Federal Government rejects my e-file, saying it wants the details. More forms, etc. TurboTax is useless.
I submitted electronically through TurboTax my taxes on January 29, and I immediately received a confirmation they were accepted both at the state and federal level. Today, I called the IRS as I have not received them, only to learn (after 45 minutes on hold) that they never actually received them and I needed to refile. Nor has the state. I called TurboTax. After 60 minutes on the phone with the dumbest women I have ever encountered, I learned I should have gotten an email from the IRS. I never got that info from TurboTax; however, they have no way for me to re-file. I need to wait 3-4 more days; it's probably a mess up with the feds, etc. Now, why would the feds search their system and say they didn't have it, etc.? The TurboTax people were simply just trying to get rid of me. After 60 minutes, I was cut off. Now what do I do? I can't refile it without their help. The system won't let me. These women could not keep my story straight, kept getting me confused, calling me the wrong name, thinking I was on hold when I was not (so I got to hear about her nephew, his pics, and what a pain I was.) Very unprofessional!
They put hold on my card for nothing. Then they asked me some information. Well today, they gave me my money but you have to fax your info to the bank corp fax 605-988-3346. So whoever is getting mess over by Turbo, go through the Bank corp 302-385-5000 and fax them your info.
We are unable to file our taxes because of a software error. This has happened to many others and been going on for over 2 weeks with no fix. Here is the error: Schedule 1: Line 11 Description has too many Characters. I've used TurboTax for many years and this may be the last!
I filed my taxes through TurboTax online software. They advertise a free or reduced return and a free state return. At the end of the process, they had upgraded my return to a deluxe version, and I also have to pay to get the money electronically deposited. I did not see this fee when I started. On top of that, I filed my return on February 5, 2012. They claim to have your refund back to you in 7 to 10 days. Not until February 14, did I find the status of my refund. I will not be getting any money until February 28. I could have filed a paper return and received close to the same results, but I was given promises and overcharged for their services. In total, I will be charged $95.00 to prepare my state and federal taxes. I will never use TurboTax again, and I will tell anybody I know not to use them, because they overcharge and make promises that are not realistic.
I filed my taxes on February 2, 2012 online on TurboTax right after my sister and brother did. We are triplets, but they used H&R Block. I applied for the TurboTax card in order to get my refund faster! I waited for the card and never received it. I called tonight as my taxes are to be done on 2/15/2011. Well, guess what, my account has been closed due to some security risk. When asked what they just said, some kind of fraudulent activity of which they could not tell me. They said that my money will be sent back to IRS and a paper check will be mailed to me. What the heck is going on?
I just wanted to let you know that the TurboTax program advertised is not free and a person using this so-called "free program" will incur charges which are not disclosed until you attempt to review and print or file your return. In addition, the charges are for the most expensive version "premier" and you cannot select any other version. It will cost a minimum of $42.95 plus filing fees!
Turbo tax is a total rip-off. I paid $40 to file my state taxes, only to find out when I was getting ready to submit it, that it would be another $20. They never indicated this up front when I was paying initially. I was on hold for 20 minutes with them when I tried calling in regard to this, and was then hung up on by accident. I am again waiting on hold for an unreasonable period of time. I will never again use Turbo Tax and suggest the same for others not wanting to get charged a ton for a simple service.
To all of you that are unhappy... it is not TurboTax that has your money. it is the IRS and if you signed up for a refund card that is not TurboTax, either it's a company that TurboTax partnered with. If you are relying on the IRS to give you money, why don't you go out and get a job, there are plenty out there, learn a trade and get busy off your lazy asses and do something instead of waiting for others to do it for you. Despite what the media says about there not having enough jobs, **, there is. You know the fastest growing job trade right now is in medical. There are medical facilities out there that are in need of competent people. Hell, you can work from home, I do and I am married and have four small kids. I make a living off of working from my home, I go to work in my PJ's and all you are complaining about how TurboTax did you wrong... No, you did you wrong. TurboTax just provides the software, the rest is up to you. Get over it and get a job. What are you going to do when you meet your maker and he asks why didn't you do better for your self ?Are you going to sit there and blame TurboTax because they didn't make the IRS give you your money. I bet, if you said that your maker will laugh in your face and kick you in your lazy bums and tell you "not good enough" you want a roof over your head and a bed to sleep in, you have to make it happen, not others. Because in the end, all you have is you. I own two businesses, have four kids and a husband and I am only 23 years old and I run a business. And all you are crying about is because the government wouldn't give you money. Look on the internet for at home jobs, all you need in a computer a phone and some sense. God gave a goat and you have it made .You can be making 4,000 + a month. Get a clue people.
Turbo Tax advertises free file for federal. I did not need to file a state return and kept clicking no. Turbo Tax will not allow a consumer to avoid the state return and charged me $27 plus a $29 processing fee. I am a student that made $7000 last year and did not wish to give Turbo Tax almost $60 of my return. This is false advertising. I could have completed a paper form and saved myself some money. I was stuck in the system and could not get out until I corrected an error and by then I was just fed up. I also received a refund card with 0 on it. I will never use free file again.
I filed my boyfriend’s taxes thru Turbo Tax. It was the first time using them. Well, I put all of his info in right and the IRS accepted his return and they direct deposited it on to the Turbo Tax card. The money never showed up. We called Turbo Tax and the IRS, who said there was no problem on their end. So we called Turbo Tax back and finally found out that they sent it back to the IRS because of an unmatched SS number. We told them that it was their mistake, not ours and we can prove that it was put in right by us. Turbo Tax will not take responsibility for this at all. They claim that it had to be our mistake. I told them that I have printed his return off and his SS number is correct. So they said all they can do is have my boyfriend send copies of his ID and SS card and a letter stating he wants his SS number corrected. I don’t see why they did not send him an email or even tried to call him to tell him about this problem before they sent the money back. It makes no sense to me at all and I don't see why they could not look up to see that the mistake was made by them and fix it themselves. Well, we just called the IRS back and they are going to just mail the return to us, but what a mess Turbo Tax has caused. I will never use them again.
They took all the fees out of my state return. After doing the math there is 67.00 dollars unaccounted for.
I have received two TurboTax cards and later got an email saying my refund was deposited into a card I never got. I cannot get through to customer service and would really like my refund of about $800.
TurboTax has lost my business forever. This is the first year I opted to get my refund on their card. It states that it is not only quicker but convenient and secure. Well it has been anything but those things. My card never came because I believe it was never actually mailed. I never have problems receiving mail so I don't believe they sent it. They finally agreed to re-issue a new card because my refund has been in their bank for weeks. TurboTax refused to give me a tracking number so I called FedEx and was able to get info on delivery date from my address. I do fear though that even when I receive the card, TT will have the account locked due to bogus security reasons. I have read that they have done this to so many people and then require them to fax sensitive information. This is just another attempt to delay the funds so they can keep them in their bank longer. This is so shady. Regardless of my electronic signature opting for this card, Intuit has misrepresented themselves and their product. I would've been better off waiting for a paper check from the IRS. If I am not able to access my money when the card finally comes, I am going to see what legal recourse I have against them. I will contact my attorney, I will file a complaint with the government at IC3.gov, I will contact the media, I will contact my local authorities to see what they can tell me, I will contact the BBB, and just about anyone who will listen. I am unsure what jurisdiction this type of injustice falls under but I intend to try every avenue in order to get my money and expose their negligence.
We used Turbo Tax for awhile now and never had any issues till now. We were told that we were to receive our refund on a specific date and never received it. We contacted the IRS and were told not they don't care what Turbo Tax says, they will get around to it when they get to it. After all that, we had a friend get it way before us. Then pay an astronomical fee. Our friend filed the same way and the same program and received hers before us. I am not saying it is unfair to us but dates should not be given unless the sure date is accurate.
TurboTax are fullof **! I filed on Jan 27. IRS said my funds would be available on Feb 8, 2012. TurboTax said my card was closed for security. Still had not reviewed or opened my card. My money was sent back to IRS! Now, I have to wait for a paper check from IRS. I really needed my money sooner than later. The whole reason for trying "Turbo-my ** Tax." Nothing is turbo about them.
I received my refund on my card on February 1st, which was actually a week earlier than I expected. I was 100% satisfied with my TurboTax experience until yesterday. After using my card numerous times over the past 10 days, I was declined for two purchase attempts yesterday, even though there was several hundred dollars still available on the card. It took me three attempts to reach a customer service agent, as the wait times exceeded an hour each time. When I was finally able to speak with one, I was told that they were doing "routine maintenance" to the system and all cards were being declined and would continue to be until sometime "the next day". I do not understand how TurboTax can make your money unavailable to you for 24+ hours. And if it is absolutely necessary, then they should notify all of its customers somehow. There is nothing more embarrassing than being denied a transaction in the store and then arguing that you know there is money on there. I had sent my teenage daughter to pick up a couple heaters since it was going to be 22 degrees last night where we live. She did not have another card to use and was mortified to say the least! When my money is made available, I am going to go ahead and withdraw it all so that this does not happen again.
I got my tax refund through TurboTax and approved that they deposited into a prepaid Visa. It worked fine. I have over $1900 in my account and it has been declined and not accepted at merchants all day today! I cannot call customer service line as their automated systems hang up on you because they say their lines are too busy! I want my money now!
Professional was used to prepare tax returns and Intuit uses the same cards for Turbo Tax as they do with their professional software and clients who have already been verified by their preparer have had portions of their refunds that have been released by the IRS, which means the funds belong to the taxpayer, not the bank. Whether they suspect fraud or not, that is the business of the government; not the bank. Anyway, they sent in verifying information more than once to be told it still has not been received and their money that is legally theirs is still being held by a prepaid card company who has no legal right to do so. That in itself is refund fraud. IRS was contacted and they stated they have not given any legal authority to intuit, Bank corp or the card program to block taxpayers refund or hold them after they have been released to them by the IRS. This is theft and fraud and beyond the scope of their authority as a prepaid card company.
I filed taxes with turbo tax and used my own account for direct deposit. Before my taxes were set to be deposited, I noticed the wrong account information. I quickly sent in a form to Santa Barbara and called, Problem solved right? No, Santa Barbara updated my checking account number only not routing number and although I called from the 6-10th of February, they did not update or attempt to stop payment. In fact, when the did finally correct my information, it took an additional three days to receive my money and they took an additional $50.00.
So I have line 58 error, which on their live community literally thousands of people are having issues with. Technical support stated that the error should be fixed this am. So I drive 30 minutes out of my way to get to a relative's house where TurboTax is installed. Nothing. I found this site and waiting on hold, read the issues going on this year, and decided to cancel my file. Janeesha, a rep in Syracuse NY "with no last name, no supervisor, no reference number, no ID no.," nothing to prove I spoke with someone, told me the line 58 issue is my error. Well, I'm not gonna waste anymore of my time if 2000 people can't fix it, and IT says it's their issue, for me to try to "fix" it. I cancelled my order, still didn't get an ID or badge number, no last name, but I did manage to persuade her to squeak out a team leader's name, Jerrard. No confirmation number either that this transaction took place, or even this conversation. No email yet that it was cancelled. I have very little faith in this company, it's statements, it's representatives, even after 5+ years of doing business with them. I'm terrified they will lock down my money and I will have no access to it, nor ever get to it in the future. If anyone reads this, please tell everyone you know to be very wary. And if they value their money (doesn't everyone?) spread the word. They are not trustworthy anymore. In fact, I'm scared that they even have my bank account number and social security numbers of my family members. Go somewhere else... at least until everyone starts getting their money back... until then, no way.
I used TurboTax for the first time last year. Believe it or not I didn't have one issue with them. However, this time around I actually filed around January 5th. Was put aside because of some new IRS forms or some **. Whatever. So it was finally accepted on January 21. Then I had an issue with state. What I found out was because federal was not accepted, they didn't accept state. OK. Moving forward. I resubmitted and went through. Ok, fine. I actually got my direct deposit on February 8th as it stated from my state refund. However, federal nothing. The cycle chart said direct deposit on February 1st. Didn't happen. Then I checked on my phone app and it said January 28 to February 10. OK. Here’s the 10th: nothing. I called the IRS and waited 30 minutes for MS. Could tell me nothing. They're reviewing your refund. If I went to my accountant, I would have gotten so much more of a refund. But I wanted it fast and this it what I get. What a waste of time! ** you and the fees as well.
I tried to help my boyfriend file his taxes through TurboTax. Huge mistake! While the fed tax is free, the additional fees and charges are outrageous. Apparently they have been getting away with this for decades. When I realized I had accidentally clicked to accept charges and filed his taxes, I searched for 3 days before finding a customer service number for TurboTax buried in the program. I had already sent an email requesting help. When I finally got through to a customer service rep he assured me the $74.95 charge I had not meant to accept would be refunded to my bank account within 2 working days. After 4 days I called to complain and the next day my entire fee of $118 was refunded to my account. Now my boyfriend’s taxes have been accepted by the IRS and he has received a refund card (at an additional bank fee of $29.95), which he cannot activate as technically we have not paid for the service. We are destitute and need help. Why will the government not step in and do something about this horrible miscarriage of justice by TurboTax? Is there a class action suit I can join? They are ripping off the people who need their refunds the most. We are starving and about to be evicted. Somebody please help!
Turbo tax are a bunch of liars. They are thieves probably making interest by holding our money. I was told that my mailing address was wrong, however, I verified my address with them twice. They never sent me my card. They are a bunch of crooked thieves.
I requested services that would make my federal return free and pay for my state return. I was to pay $30 for the state return. I was charged $29.95 for a Bank Refund Processing Service Fee and $27.95 for TurboTax Fees. The bank refund fee was charged because the company claimed that my return was going to be given to me via bank card, which is not what I requested and not what was written in my contract that I received and printed directly from TurboTax. I requested a direct deposit into my bank account, which is explicitly stated in my printed contract. While contacting the company, I was told that my return was going to delivered to me through this bank card that I did not request. On top of that, I am a minor and I am unable to legally sign into a contract and this company allowed me to sign into a contract with them without an "e-sign" from any guardian. They said that I would be getting my refund through this bank card, which would have also required a contract, which I still could not sign by myself since I am a minor. After jumping through hoops with customer service, they claimed that there was no documentation that I was to get any other kind of return, which is the opposite of what I had been previously told. I was also told that no supervisor was available to speak to. This is the worst company I have ever worked with. They are taking advantage of minors, issuing illegal contracts, providing awful service and stealing peoples' money.
You all should stop blaming TurboTax for having to verify your accounts and start blaming the ignorant, selfish, degrading ** that commit fraudulent tax refunds using identities of poor senile people which in fact could be your mother, neighbor or spouse. Do you all not see there's a new broadcast on the news everyday talking about tax fraud with TurboTax cards. It's because of the people in this society why this is occurring in the first place!
This was my first time using TurboTax and it will be my last. I did my taxes online on January 19th 2012. Everything went smoothly. I received my confirmation via email that IRS received my information on January 20th 2012. I received an email it was in progress. TurboTax stated that I was scheduled to receive my taxes on February 1st 2012. I know this will not be true because I owed some taxes from last year. IRS had change the date to Feb 7th 2012. On Feb 7th 2012, I had looked again on where is my refund. The date was change to Feb 8th 2012 with my remaining balance after deduction. I received my card and activated it with no problem. But on Feb 8th 2012, IRS had deposit my refund when I checked to see the money was on the card. I had received a message that the card was closed. I called TurboTax. They told me it was a security hold on the card and I need to fax over my ID, SS and proof of address. I asked the rep why I was notified of this when I filed my taxes, TurboTax put the hold on my card on Feb 7th 2012. This sound so suspicious to do this day before a deposit. It was okay for IRS to deposit the money into the account with no I.D, SS or proof of address but it's not okay to give my money to me from your standards (TurboTax). So I faxed the information to them, called them back they told me it will take up 24 hours to view the information. This was on Feb 8th 2012. Customer service line is so bad. I wonder if it's only one person answering the phone. TurboTax, I need money now! You had put me in a jam with my bills, rent, food. I need my money now! Someone please help us to expedite our money from TurboTax.
I am extremely upset with these people. I got my card, tried to activate it and, first of all, I couldn't get through the phone lines--not even to the automated service. I tried to use the online service and it was "down.” When I finally got to somebody, they told me there was a security hold on my card that won't even be activated. When I asked why, I was told they couldn't tell me why. The exact response I kept getting was “I only know what's on my screen." Really? Then I was told I would have to do this, that, and the other just to get my card activated, so I said, "Fine, just cancel it.” But they told me they couldn't even cancel it until I faxed all of that ** to them. So, I had no choice because my refund was due to deposit in 2 days. Then I'm told it will take 5-7 days to unlock my card and they have no number to give me to contact the 3rd party company to see when it will be unlocked. Also, I asked the idiot if it was even possible for money to be deposited to an inactive card and again, “I don't know." Now, my money has been deposited and these idiots can't tell me where it is. They even told me that it was put onto a different card that I don’t have; then they said they didn't know for sure. I am furious. My money is lost in Turbo Tax's world of idiots and I'm helpless.
I received my Turbo Tax card in the mail, when I called to activate it, I received a message saying it was closed. When I spoke with customer service rep from Turbo Tax, I was told I had to send in a copy of driver's license, social security card, and proof of address. So I faxed it. as I was told to, and still nothing. When I talked to a customer representative again, I was told it would be 5-7 business days, before the account could be verified and reopened. Well, it has been 5-7 business days, and still nothing. My refund was deposited on February 3rd, yet I cannot use the card.
I have used turbo tax for years and have never experienced any problems before. This year while attempting to e- file my return, the computer keep saying there was an error and I would need to mail the tax documents. I tried multiple times to review and fix the error, but turbo tax kept saying no errors detected. I do not trust that the information is correct due to the fact turbo tax would say no errors but later say there was an error. I will not be mailing in my tax documents. I fear they are incorrect. They e filed my state return and said it would be 24-72 hours before accepted by the IRS. I checked my status and no information is available. Now, I feel like I should pay someone else to complete my returns. By the way, Turbo Tax did manage to take my money. I unless they can refund my money, I will not use turbo tax nor would I recommend it.
My refund was deposited by the IRS on February 1, 2012 onto a TurboTax Card. I was able to use the card a couple of times. I went to the ATM tonight to get cash and my transaction was denied. I called TurboTax and was told that I needed to send in my ID, SS card and bill to show proof of address. I do not understand. How can TurboTax hold on to my money, even if the federal government saw it fit to send. If the IRS found no reason to hold back my refund. How can TurboTax hold it? This is definitely a reason for a class action suit. All those who have complaints, let see about suing their sorry **.
Billing was inaccurate. They put me on hold for over 15 minutes and in the chat line it was about 10 minutes. I hung up and logged off. I kept receiving error on state tax. I went in, fixed it, and they kept denying claim. Again, nobody answered or responded to phone or chat. I chose 1040EZ, they billed me for the deluxe package. I will never use them again or recommend them. I went to H&R Block without any difficulty.
I called and spoke with a representative named Mark #** that was no help. Basically, he’s telling me the same thing over and over, why they just fired all of them and leave it as an electronic representative we get better service there. I then wanted to speak to a supervisor and he told me that his supervisor will tell me the same thing. I insisted to talk to him and was on hold for 20 minutes for a supervisor named Alex. But then Mark, the representative, told me that his supervisor (Alex) said there is no need to speak with him because he is going to say the same thing. Now I see where the poor customer service from the representatives come from. If the supervisor has poor customer skills then we can't expect a lot from the representatives. I am a store manager for a large clothing department, and trust me, I will never ever give that kind of customer service. This will be my last year doing business with TurboTax. I recommend TurboTax to hire more experienced people. I will tell everyone in my town to stop doing business with these guys. How can a company hold my money that I work for? I feel am being robbed by TurboTax.
My return was deposited on my TurboTax card and after I used the card one time, they put a hold on it. I called them and waited over an hour on the phone only to be informed that I needed to fax in my DL and ss card along with proof of address. So I did so, then when I called again, I was told it would take up to 14 days for my hold to be released off my card. This is a rip off I have never heard of such a thing in my life. They have hung up on me numerous times after I waited at least an hour to speak with someone. This is fraud. Can someone please help me beings that they put the security holds but cannot release them and refuse to give me the number to bank corp. who they say do?
I filed my 2011 Federal tax return using Turbo Tax Deluxe Software on January 13, 2012. My Federal Tax return was accepted by IRS as of January 17, 2012. I was told by IRS and Intuit that I should expect my refund to be direct deposited into my checking account on January 25, 2012. However, my refund was not direct deposited on January 25, 2012. The next direct deposit date that was given to me was January 31, 2012. Again my refund was not direct deposited into my account. I called IRS and was told that my tax returning was still being processed and that I should call back by February 03, 2012. I contacted IRS back on February 03, 2012 only to be told that my return is still being process. I followed up also with calling Turbo tax to complain that after being given so many different dates that I am yet to receive my refund. I was told by Turbo Tax that there was nothing that they could do I would have to follow-up with the Santa Barbara bank or keep contacting IRS. Santa Babara Bank only told me that IRS had not made any deposit into my account. I finally learned on 2/6/12 while speaking to an IRS agent that I made a error on my tax return form . This troubles me as Turbo tax software is suppose to have a GPS system help identify errors when made. This did not happen, and now I am faced with waiting until the matter is electronically corrected by IRS system before I will see my refund and there is no definite date of when that will be.
I filled my 2011 tax return with TurboTax like I have done for the past 2 years. I filled on the 25th of January, received my TurboTax card on the 27th and tried to activate it on January 30. On that day, I found out that my card was closed and there had been a security lock put on my card. On January 31, I called back to find out that I had to fax over my ID, SSC card and proof of address to prove to them that I am me. On February 3, 2012, my tax refund was deposited to that account with TurboTax card and around 11: 30, I faxed the information to them and was told to call back to verify that it has been received. I called and was told by the TurboTax representative that I had to allow 3-10 business days for my information to be processed. So I waited until Monday, February 6, 2012 and called them around 2 pm. I was questioned about my mailing address on file and was told that the US postal service could not recognize my address and that was the reason a security lock was put on my account. They said first that there were four numbers 1215 that didn’t belong but 1215 is my apartment number and I never had any problem receiving mails from anywhere. So I'm thinking this the reason why and I feel a little better now but on February 7, 2012, I called to check again and now I’m being told that the US postal service cannot recognize Xing which is part of my address ****. Whether it’s Xing or Crossing, it does not matter because my mail always get to my mail box so I began to think and wonder why all of a sudden they give me an explanation to why my account is blocked and just last week, they were so worried about protecting my identity that they wouldn't even tell me why it was blocked and come to the conclusion that it's some bull and just lied straight to my face about my address not being recognized by the Post office. I cannot believe what I have to go through to get my money. I don't know what to do and really feel like something needs to be done. I don't even care about the money any more. It is the principle and the simple fact that they are requesting sensitive information from people without any results being done. They are liars, and full of crap. Please, please, help me. I need to do something about this. Too many people are being pulled into their little game.
I completed my taxes using Turbo Tax, and put in my bank information to have my refund direct deposit into my account. The Turbo Tax software selected the Turbo Tax card. Each time I tried to update it back to my bank info, it continued to default to the Turbo Tax card. I received a card in the mail about 2 weeks ago. I activated it online. Now, the IRS said my return was deposited today. When I checked online, it says it has $0.00. I have contacted the number listed, and kept getting a recording all operators are busy, and then the phone hangs up. This is unacceptable, and I am very disappointed. I use Turbo Tax every year, but will not use them anymore.
I have used TurboTax online for 7 years with no problems but will never recommend again. I (luckily) discovered an error on my Federal Tax return 2012 after paying for Deluxe but before E filing. After hours of online chat with two reps who would or could not understand the problem, I was finally promised a refund and free download of the desktop version. The desktop version confirmed my conclusion, entering the exact same information (I actually went through it step by step with my screen split between the online and desktop version) my refund with the desktop version was more than $700 more than online. I finally got to speak to a rep (supposedly a manager/supervisor) on the phone, was promised the refund was in process. The issue would be checked and I would get a call back in 3 days to be sure I was satisfied. A week later, I still had not received the refund or call back. After trying to contact customer support again (it is much too difficult), I found the refund had not even been processed. I am sure the online error has not been corrected and others are filing faulty tax returns. TurboTax customer service is almost criminal in its lack of information and problem solving skills. It took more than 20 minutes just to get the corporate address so I could file a complaint with the Better Business Bureau.
The only reason the I went with TurboTax was because it stated that my refund would be here in 7 days; otherwise, I would only have used e-file and only had to pay $29.00 instead of $59.00. That is very misleading. I just checked on my refund, and it stated that I should receive my refund by the 21st. if this is the case, I should be and I will not use TurboTax again.
I don't understand what's going on. I called in regards to my own money, and I don't get any answers. Now, TurboTax line has been busy according to them for days now. So now, you can't even speak to a live representative. My money was deposited on the TurboTax prepaid card over 2 weeks ago. This has to be stealing! What is going on, Turbo Tax? Please explain it to the public. I worked for my money. I paid you, guys, with my hard-earned money. And now, I can't seem to get my money back from you guys. I don't know what to do at this point, and after reading all of these reviews, I will tell everyone who will listen to never use your services.
My mother's income tax that I have worked so very hard for was direct deposited in my account with TurboTax and they have my money and will not release what is entitled to me. I worked hard and I had faxed them 12 times my info, proving that I am who I am. I just want my money, because this is not right and they do not have to worry about me ever, ever using them again. Believe that. Today is Feb. 07. 2012 and I still haven't received my money yet and it was dropped on the 1st of Feb.
I used Turbo Tax "free edition" to file my 2010 tax return and then decided to use them again for my 2011 tax return. I clearly clicked on the "Free Federal Edition" and was fine with paying $27.95 to e-file my state tax return through Turbo Tax. However, when I spent nearly an hour filing my taxes and was close to finish, I noticed that it automatically upgraded me to the "Deluxe Version", which was not what I had ordered. It did not give me any options to downgrade, instead it promptly asked for my credit card number and did not specify the total amount until the next page and by that time my credit card information has already been entered in. When I got to the next page, I immediately tried to find a way to correct this and went back instead of clicking on "confirm payment" (something to that effect) and found out that it was nearly impossible to figure this out myself, so I tried to locate a phone number that I could call for help with this matter. However, the phone number for Turbo Tax was next to impossible to find. You actually have to enter in your problem and they'll assign you a "Reference Number" and then a number for you to call. By this time, I was frustrated and felt like this whole ordeal was extremely deceiving and this is clearly a "Bait and Switch" tactic that Turbo Tax is using on their returning customers. The final bill came to $66.90, which I didn't agree on and when I went back to the e-filing section, it had already charged my credit card despite not clicking on the "confirm payment" icon. So I called customer service, waited for about 25 minutes and got a representative from India with a very heavy accent and had to listen very closely to him, otherwise it was next to impossible to understand what he was saying. I explained to him my situation and he was very helpful and understanding. He offered to refund the difference but I would have to call back after 24 hours because my credit card was just charged within that hour. I'll see how that goes tomorrow. He also informed me that in order to avoid the "Upgraded Version" next year, I would have to create a new user ID and password because if you sign in as a returning customer, it will automatically transfer the previous year's tax information for you, which is not a feature on the "Free Edition". In conclusion, they just lost a returning customer based on this unethical bait and switch method that they use for their returning customers. Also, the only thing that is informing me of the upgrade is the "Deluxe" word below the Turbo Tax icon on the top left corner, which is very well placed with the intentions of you not catching it unless you paid very close attention! Never again!
I filed my taxes on the 15th of January. I still do not have my card as of February 7th, 2012. They say 7 to 10 business days my **. The IRS had my money to me by February 1. I have $7000 that I can’t freaking touch right now and I need to. I am so ** about this. I feel like this isn’t legal. They told me that I should blame the post office and then they had the freaking nerve to tell me that I had to pay to order another card express. 20 damn dollars--are you for real? I have always used the H&R Block card and I have never ever had this problem. My card is always in the mail when they say it will be in the mail. Turbo Tax: never again. The worst tax experience ever. I don’t see them being in business for much longer. They are going to get sued for everything they have.
I just filed my taxes through TurboTax on Feb 2, 2012 my refund was accepted that same day. Two business days later, I received my TurboTax card in the mail. I went to activate the card and it sends me to a rep! I was on hold for over an hour. They told me I had to send in proof of identity like driver's license and SSN and a bill. I called the same day to make sure that they received the fax. They said yes but that I need to resend the information! Why? I have no idea! Now I'm reading all these reviews of how I am not the only one this has happened to! This not good for business. I'm now on the phone with the IRS trying to redirect my money. Wish me luck! I will never ever use TurboTax again!
I paid $57.95 for TurboTax Refund Card and never received the credit card. Each time I called, I was on hold for about 53 minutes and when I asked to speak to a supervisor I was hung up on over and over again. After several days of calling, I requested my card to be FedEx'ed to me and was charged $19.95 for having it expedited. I called to get a tracking number for FedEx so I can track when it will be delivered as I need to be home to sign for the delivery. I was told that they were not able to provide a tracking number. I will never use TurboTax and again!
The IRS released my refund on 1/25. I tried to use my Turbo Tax card and it was denied. I called Turbo Tax to find out that they locked my card. I had to send proof of address, SS, ID. I sent proof that same day. I was told by the rep 1-2 days. After the 2nd day, I called back and was told 2-3 days. After the 3rd day, I was told 5-7 days and it's now 02/07/2012. I called and talked to a supervisor and I advised her I need my money. My cable has been shut off, rent is late and barely enough of food. She said, it's nothing she can do - it's for security purposes. I advised her they had my info long enough and I need my money. She stated nothing she can do then she hung up on me. I called back and I advised them, "by law, if the IRS accepted your refund, it's not their job to keep holding my money". She hung up again. I come to find out it's more than me whose money they are holding. It doesn't take that long to see address, identification and social. They have nothing on their website about holding everyone's money. If they are protecting me, then I have no idea who have access to my real personal info. I wish they can send my refund back to the IRS. I called the IRS and had to print a 3949a form and fax it to them so they can intervene with them. This is a load of crap. I shouldn't go through this with this company. This is the last and final time for Turbo Tax. How come they are holding everyone's money who had it placed on a card and not for bank accounts? My friend did her taxes way after me on Turbo Tax and she just received her money on 02/06/2012. Is there a lawyer or class action lawsuit? This is not fair nor right for them to be holding my money and refuse to speak to me now. Crooks.
They deposit my money on 01/31/12. I withdrew $500. I went to use it again on 02/02/12 and it was blocked. I called to give them my security code. They said it was wrong and they can’t give me my money without boiling it all down. I still haven’t got it.
I simply went to file my taxes on the so easy and fast Turbo Tax. I chose the "free" edition because I am a student and do not have complicated reductions. After entering all my information in order to finish, you have to pay a fee of $29.99 to file your state taxes. This is clearly not free and is a hidden fee that should not be there. Just be aware when using Turbo Tax free edition of the not so free fees.
I filed my taxes with Turbo Tax. I have contacted them a few times about not receiving my turbo tax card. The IRS deposited my money already but I have no clue on how to get it. Every time I speak to someone from Turbo Tax they say my card is in flight. I have waited over two weeks and still haven't got the card. When I asked to speak with a supervisor they hung up on me. I just don't know what to do at this point.
I filed my taxes and had the refund put onto a TurboTax prepaid visa card. The IRS accepted my taxes that I filed and I got the funds on my card on 1-30-2012. I was able to use my card until today 2-6-2012. I had to get my car's starter fixed and when I went to pay for it, my card became declined. I called and after waiting for an hour, I was told by a TurboTax card rep that I had to fax my ID, social security card and proof of residence because my account was closed for my security and safety. I have to miss work because of this situation. My mom is a disabled vet and I need the car to get her to and from work. I can't even pay to get my car fixed because of the TurboTax prepaid visa people closing my card's account. I can't even log into my account online. If there is a class action lawsuit against this company, please let me know. I will be more than willing to join in. I am also contacting the Better Business Bureau.
I got my TurboTax Card. I followed instructions to activate it and got the response that my card was closed! I asked why and got told security reasons. Okay... understandable, but when you fax over your personal info that was requested to prove your identity and the ** place can,t tell you if it was received, and most of all they do not release your funds or open your account back up! Result is this; the bank that the IRS deposited your money to decided to close everybody's account with out notice, still charge the TurboTax fee, not direct deposit your money into your TurboTax Card account (because, oops, for some reason it's closed and you can not fix it). So, the bank holds your money for 10 days, then sends it back to the IRS and then within 6 weeks, the IRS will send you your money back. Do not blame the IRS! Blame goes 100% to TurboTax and their affiliates! Ask what bank TurboTax uses and they won't tell you because they have several. Google your routing number and you get a little hope thinking, " yes! I get to speak to the bank" ...well, no hope because they will say you do not have any accounts with us and never have. I have spent the past 48 hours calling every single possible number located in Google for this ** and my final result is this, In 6 weeks, IRS will send me a paper check. They can not send it sooner because that bank holds your money for 10 days then the IRS has to do their part to get your money to you and trust me, it is not a quick process because TurboTax screwed so many of their people that next year... they will not have a business to deal with when it comes to these stupid prepaid cards. Good luck to anybody who begs to differ and count me in on the lawsuit!
I've used Turbo Tax for two previous tax seasons, without any problems until now. My Turbo Tax refund card arrived with a block on it. I sent in all the info required by Turbo Tax's customer service to unblock my card (fax of driver's license, proof of address, and social security number), and was told to call back 5 to 7 business days later, only to be told the block is still in place, and all info needs to be faxed once again. I requested to speak with a supervisor, or the management, and was told there was no one else who could be of any further assistance and was hung up on. This will be my last year using turbo tax. It's just not worth the frustration involved.
I filed my taxes Jan 17, 2012 with TurboTax, I received a TurboTax card and I activated it 2 days before the IRS released my refund, which was January 30 and here it is, February 5 and they still haven't released my refund or reactivated my card. I was first told that it takes 5 to 7 days for everything to be processed but when I spoke with someone today, they said it wont be released until the 13th of February! What the ** could take so long? I sent the fax that they asked for on the 28th of January and here it is, almost 2 weeks. So today, they connected me to someone that asked me about what I faxed and verified that he had all my info and now, they must verify what I sent but wasn't that the reason for me to send my info? So that they had proof that it's me that filed! It's just real ** that I had all my family file with them also. Never again will I ever do business with TurboTax.
I've been using TurboTax for over 10 years but this year's issue (purchased software) is the worst I've seen and used! Dependents - Easy Guide asks if you provided more than half of your child's support but should really ask if your child earned and is reporting more than $3700. This is this year's cut-off. Answering "yes" will issue a faulty return if your child earned more than $3700 even though TurboTax analysis states everything is fine and ready for transmission. For me, resulted in several phone calls and two IRS rejections until this was cleared up. Also, error-check screens do not display accurate correction options and do not take you to where the error occurs either in the Easy Guide or the respective form. Forms print out differently than they are displayed on the screen making comparisons difficult. Box numbers do not match the emailed box numbers reference, if IRS rejects. Email reports from TurboTax are not easily understood and do not take you to where the issue is located on your return. Point-of-frustration: TurboTax needs to spend less effort on after-sale enticements and more effort on making sure information is properly collected, forms can be easily accessed, error-reporting more intuitive and email reporting easier to understand!
I made under the recommended amount to get free filing from them, but they turned around and charged me close to $60.00 in fees. I talked to one of their representatives and all I could get out of that person is what am I supposed to do. I did notify my state that they are charging fees when they are not supposed to. They charged my daughter $96.00 and she was on assistance last year.
I was overcharged for e-filing my taxes. I called to get help and I was overcharged and was promised to have the money that was overcharged ($236.95). The agent charged too much, so I asked to talk to a manager on February 3 and supposedly was sent to a manager, and I came to find out that today, February 6, it was another agent. The manager said I would get the funds in my bank account in 24 to 48 hours. Because TurboTax charged me too much, I have been on the phone since 8:30 am trying to talk to a supervisor to resolve this problem. I am very angry that I was lied to. I have done my taxes with TurboTax for over 10 years and I am very disappointed and I will not go through TurboTax next year. I will tell all my family and friends how bad this company is, and also how hard it is to get anything resolved or to get to a manager or supervisor. I would like this situation taken care of.
I called to activate the debit card from Turbo Tax, only to be told it was closed. Now, they want me to fax in sensitive info, and wait another week for my money! I've used Turbo for years, and have never been so dissatisfied. This is the last time, and I will make sure no one else does.
After 2010 taxes, I bought the 2011 taxes in advance. I got my DVD in Oct. 2011 and waited until Jan. 2012 and then tried to do my taxes. I could not download the DVD onto my computer. It would not download because I needed to download Service Pack 3. After 3 hours of total frustration, I was not able to download without a new spyware virus. Then, I tried to get a hold of Turbo Tax for some help. The helpdesk is in India and you know how easy it is to talk to them. Well, no refund and taxes were done and they could care less. I have used Turbo Tax for 5 years and never had a problem. I will never use them again. They are another American company that would rather scam you than provide the service they sell. People watch out!
They blocked my card after the IRS deposit my refund. They let me activated the card and when my money got there, they held my money.
This will be the last time I use Turbo Tax. On 01/26/2012, my card was blocked. As requested, I faxed in my informs to verify with Turbo Tax that I am the person that filed the tax return. My card was never unblocked. My SATE and IRS refund was returned back to the IRS and they state that I call the corp office, only to told that my account has been blocked. They could not give a reason and the$ 29.95 that I was charged for their prepaid visa was non-refundable. This delay has put me in a hardship.
I filed with TurboTax on 1/12/2012. My filing was accepted on 1/17/2012. After waiting until the day IRS told me to call if I hadn't received my funds, I contacted TurboTax and the CS for the TurboTax visa card. They told me I had to fax a copy of my driver's license and social security card, I did. A week went by and they told me to call them to find out they needed a bill for proof of address. So I did. Today, I called back and they told me they need me to send everything together again. So I did, having no choice because they won't let you speak to anyone in that dept. And even the supervisors said there is nothing they can do except have me fax the info over again. I don't have money to eat, money for fuel to get to work, to pay my vehicle insurance and I was told that I have to wait 5-7 days for it to be processed again. I am at the end of my ropes and don't know what to do. If there is a class action or legal action against this company, please include me. I will do anything I can to help hold this company responsible for their incompetence.
For the tax years 2009 and 2010, I had to pay over $500 to the IRS, due to a mistake made by Turbo Tax. It was never resolved, and because of this, I will never use Turbo Tax again.
I used the debit card option and e-filed with Turbo Tax. Days after the IRS verified it deposited my refund, no money ever showed on my card. I spent hours on the phone, both live and automated, and they can only blame the IRS! They had the nerve to say that maybe I entered the wrong routing number or account! They e-filed for me to my card! I didn't enter anything! They still have my money and the IRS said they can't do anything about for five more days! Beware of Turbo Tax!
So I filed with Turbo Tax, got my card, our refund was put on the card. We were able to spend about $1,000.00, then in the middle of a transaction, the card was denied. we called, and was informed that the card was closed for security review, that I had to send in proof of address, SS card, and ID. I did this all within half a day on the 26th, and was told it would be cleared up in 3 days. It's now the 2nd of Feb, and we have gotten the runaround so much, it's not even funny. I think a class action suit is what these people need! They say they are protecting me. From what? My money? This has hugely ** me off. I would rather pay $300 to H&R Block, then put up with this **!
I was one of the first to file my taxes this 2012 year. I used Turbo Tax for the 3rd time in a role. And they ** me big time. They blocked my debit card and still to this day have not released my refund. The IRS has done their part but these ** are still holding my money due to some fraud investigations. I too had to send in all sorts of info to prove who I was. No one who answers the customer service number can tell me what’s going on. All I keep getting is, we have no update. If I had known that once I signed into Turbo Tax this year I would be getting **, I would have sign in using condoms and some Vaseline.
I am trying to download TurboTax on my laptop but it does not show up in my account on the TurboTax website. It shows I purchased it on 12/19/11 but it is not there to download. The only thing that shows is Quicken Home & Business. I need to load it on my laptop in addition to my home PC. I tried to copy from the PC to a flash drive to load it but I was instructed I had to do it from the website which does not show the program to download. In FAQ it says to load to the computer then copy it to a flash or CD, but when I do this it comes up with the message to load it from the web download page where it does not appear. What can I do? I surely can't reload for three years. I can't even load a recent download.
I am not a Turbo Tax customer, but their system allowed someone to open an account, request a prepaid credit card, and file fraudulent taxes using my email address. When I called to file fraud charges with Turbo Tax, I was told that they do not have anyone who handles fraud with their software/system and that I would have to use companies outside of Turbo Tax to try and solve the mess they created.
I decided to use the Turbo Tax debit card. What a nightmare it has been. I filed my taxes on 01/06/12 and was told my card should be mailed to me by 01/16/12 never received it. I called to see where my card was told me I should have received it, so they cancelled that card and reissued a new one. On 01/30/12 I received the one that they said they mailed to me originally. I activated the card used the card at several locations. I went to Fry's grocery store last night went to use the card and was declined. Called Turbo Tax card services and was told they could not tell me why the card was declined and would mail me a new card. So in the mean time I am embarrassed because I could not pay for my food and the card had more than enough money to pay my bill. Now I feel turbo tax is holding MY money and cannot get the problem corrected. As soon as I receive the replacement I a taking all the money off of the card and will never use turbo tax again. This was the worst experience I have ever experienced with any company. I am filing a complaint with the Better Business Bureau and The county attorney's office. This is BS and they cannot hold my money hostage.
Not only didn't they send CA FTB 2011 of which I filed and paid what I owed, they didn't do refunds for the products I purchased and tried to refund. I am also asking for the NSF fees and feel they should reimburse me, because I wanted a refund in a timely manner. They didn't even write up a form for it. They have operators in call centers in India and the Philippines. In no way am I trying to be rude but their English was difficult to understand.
I have filed my taxes with Turbo Tax for 3 years. All of a sudden, they need to verify my identity. I had to fax them very sensitive information, and they couldn't even tell me whether it was received or not. The customer service line won't give me any information, and now their toll free number just hangs up on me. It is wrong to have a person sitting in limbo, wondering if their information is with someone secure, and to not even be able to check the status, is worse. Turbo Tax has lost my business and everybody else I referred, because this is unacceptable!
I've done my taxes. They have been accepted but Turbo Tax thinks it their job to hold my money along with everybody else who has used my address for a safe mailing address for which they don't have locking mail boxes. I want to sue for everything they got. This is not right. I know my rights and they have no right holding my money. It's the law. Get to know it, Turbo Tax.
My daughter filed my taxes in 2008, and she entered AIG numbers, but the IRS did not receive the information because the system did not register the tax information. And now, I have to pay $16,000.00 because of your inadequate system. I would like to file a suit ASAP. Please count me in!
I have used Turbo Tax to prepare my taxes since 2007 and have never been audited or dissatisfied. I was recently informed by the IRS that an audit of my 2010 return has resulted in a $3500.00 error with penalties accruing. With great difficulty, I finally managed to contact Turbo Tax, regarding their 100% accuracy guarantee policy and filed a formal complaint pursuant to their claims policy. The denial response came within hours of the complaint (filed on a holiday) from an alleged Turbo tax analyst, citing nothing substantive or concrete to support their position. Clearly the volume of data I was required to send was not carefully reviewed as less than twelve (12) hours had passed since the transmission of data! Essentially, due to no fault or negligence of my own, the 2010 software malfunctioned while calculating my "taxable" income, errors so profound that it's obvious upon close scrutiny of the 1040 Form. Since I blindly trusted the Turbo Tax service, I never reviewed the hard-copies e-filed, believing all to be in order. Much to my chagrin, I did review the 1040 Form after the IRS notice and saw the error almost instantly. Contacting Turbo Tax staff or any affiliate was difficult as they do not list any contact info with their product(s). I had to diligently search the internet and found other user complaints blogged with info on how to contact their offices. This resulted in exhaustive phone interviews, constantly resulting in accusations of ignorant misuse of the software and/or negligence and error on the user end. Once I obtained the website to file the complaint (reluctantly provided), I was overwhelmed with the cumbersome process of the claims protocol, involving the scanning and attaching of files, documents, etc. and emailing. The website contained a notification that 4-8 weeks were required to review the claim data, yet I received a denial within hours! My experience has led me to believe that their policy is to deny all claims initially and leave it to the consumer to find the correct remedy to resolve the matter. I respectfully submit my complaint for review. I hope to speak to a lawyer, but I cannot afford to hire an attorney as my resources are limited. Please help!
We got a turbotax card for our taxes this year. We sent in our taxes early to beat the dead line and a hour before our taxes hit the card the card said our account was closed. We got this tax card 1/05/2012, they said due to a security hold they closed the account. We found out that all you needed was to prove who we are with SSI cards and ID and a bill we sent that in and it has been 5 days and our taxes haven't been released and the account is still closed, and I guess now, we have to wait until the IRS sends us a new check instead of getting our money through turbotax card, and now that's like a month. Very unhappy with service desk. They have answering questions because they don't answer with any common sense. Hey read it from paper and that's all they know. What a good help desk. I will never use turbotax card again for the month hold I have to pay for now .
2011 TurboTax is riddled with problems, and is unethically steering people who are entitled to a "free state" into purchasing their home state instead of one they may prefer (it was already installed in my brand new Deluxe with free state download upon opening). This then requires an additional purchase or an hour on the phone or chatting to get a free download from them of the state you want. The Connecticut software is completely broken and generated a $7,000 refund for me when it should have been 0. Its forms have nothing in common with the actual Connecticut forms. It does not even open if another state is used in conjunction. The CS is just awful, little technical knowledge (I figured out more on my own than with the "tech" specialist) and they have zero tax knowledge. After promising me a return call within 24 hours, no one ever called. I have used this product for 5 years with no problem but will be switching to another brand ASAP. I already wasted 5 times what I would have spent in hours preparing my taxes manually and still have a malfunctioning product. I took a survey after my CS experience and after typing and filling the out in detail. When I clicked on submit, there is an error in transmission, so no real recourse. I am on hold now for 20 minutes trying to get to them for a refund.
I bought the 2011 Missouri software for $39.95. I entered my information and got one result. Then I went back to print the Federal return and ended up with a different refund amount. I then went to the trouble of doing my state return (for free) on the state website and ended up with a 3rd result. Supposedly, Inuit has a 60-day back refund policy but I could not find out how to get that on their website. I am not happy!
Being forced to go online to fill out W2 and W9 is wrong, particularly when your "form is not available at this time, try later". Is this a stupid business decision on your part or is it just selfish (like it increases your profit and wastes my time)? I will try your online forms again in a little while so I can finish this simple thing but by wasting more of my time. Why don't we have the option of just downloading the forms on our computer like last year? Even this complaint form is a pain, but I thought you should know and I may not be the only one looking for alternatives,
The rep I spoke to was a very lovely gal who really tried to help me with the issue shown below that was supposed to be fixed by TurboTax as of 1/12, but as of 1/26 was not. The supposed CPA I online chatted with was clueless and the solution is not what should be done. I wonder what the IRS and the Better Business Bureau as well as others I will complain to about this will say. It’s a shame, your poor rep who listened to me vent repeatedly about my total frustration with this tax service had no way to really help me. All she could do is listen to me, and she did. A lovely rep, Shellie J. I applaud her skills as a rep. She, unlike your company, tried to help. My suggestion: give me my money back. In all the many years I have dealt with this tax company, this is the worst. I will not be happy about having to use your service again and will tell others do not use TurboTax. They take your money, do not offer real solutions to issues that are their problem, and do not offer even their employees tools to really solve problems. I want my money back. I want this situation fixed. I want satisfaction. I will have it someway. Here's your issue. The solution: remove the UC1099G. I am sure the IRS would be happy about this. I am not. I lost money on my refund and no, I am not refilling a correction. No. Not my problem, it is yours. From your website 1099-G unemployment: Box 4 appears to be entered in error (updated: 1/06/2012, Article ID SLN55179). Work around: the 1099-G for unemployment with a 'zero' amount will need to be deleted from the return to remove the error message. If you need help deleting the 1099-G for unemployment, please use the help link below.
The Turbo Tax bank and company received my refund, took out their fees, blocked my card and sent my money back to IRS. I’m very upset and need some to be done or I’m going to go to the media and get a lawyer.
I have been filing my taxes for years with Turbo Tax to find that the calculations are incorrect. In 2009, I filed my taxes with Turbo Tax. I received a letter saying I was on audit and there were errors on my tax return, which I answered all the questions correctly using Turbo Tax thinking I was doing the right thing. Now, the IRS says I owe them over $7000.00 for penalties, fine and not allowing me to have my earned income credit which with the audit I now no type of credit will be given. For the life of me, I do not understand how I only made $25000.00 in 2009, but I have to pay $7000.00 in fines and penalties to the IRS because of Turbo Tax. I can not afford an attorney to help me sort this out much less pay the IRS.
CD for Turbo tax will not download. I cannot get a number for help. I have used this product since 1996. I am so upset that there is no number to call for tech help.
I filed my 2010 taxes in January 2011 using Turbo Tax. A family friend said it was easy. I've always used Jackson Hewitt. I filled in the pertinent information to include my unemployment. I get part of my ex’s pension from the military; we were married twenty years. I have two daughters, one was in college during that year. I supplied all Social Security Numbers, ID numbers for all my wages, W2's. I gave every thing it asked. I got a refund over $5,000. I’m head of household. In December of this year I get an AUR from the IRS that my numbers didn't match correctly on my taxes. I didn't receive the child credit (huh?), and I didn't earn income. I'm lost! So, I knew I had paid the insurance to cover any problems to Turbo Tax. I called and was connected to Joe at Tax Resource, representative for Turbo Tax, who does a search and tells me I filled it out wrong and that Turbo Tax cannot help me. What? Okay, I'm a single mom, unemployed now two years. I'm a caregiver to my mother who had a brain aneurysm.I barely make enough in child support to survive with my seven-year old daughter who has multiple heart defects and chronic asthma. I need help. My nerves are shot! Joe was very rude saying I didn't want to take the blame. I trusted Turbo Tax. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Very upset.
I have been using and paying for an application, through Intuit work place. Unfortunately, all of my employees use this to submit time sheets, and we also pull reports for billing from this application. The item has been unavailable, but they continue to invoice us for the application. There is no support from Intuit, and we are unable to cancel the billing, and we are having to fight the billing through our credit card.
That should be -5. I completed all but one, the PIN for sending tax return via e-file on 1/20/12. When I attempted to complete the form, obtain the PIN this morning, I wasn't able to access my Turbo Tax. I went through the process of changing my password but couldn't confirm the change, not even copying and pasting the website as instructed. I was told the website didn't exist. I have not been able to access and complete my taxes. Turbo Tax now has all my personal and pertinent information which is very scary. It also has my payment for the e-file as well as a credit card number and three numbers from the card back. I've spent over 7 hours since last evening and I'm very frustrated. The fact that this site exists tells me I'm not the only person who's had problems.
For the 2009 tax year, I followed the TurboTax interview process. For my state taxes, I identified the county in which I live on the 2nd screen of the process. Later in the process, the software told be to deduct, as a credit, a mortgage tax recording fee and entered that onto my return. It turns out that, according to the law, this credit is not allowed in my county! According to TurboTax, this is my fault because I should know all of the intricacies of the tax law and does not fall under their hollow guarantee. Apparently, they don't have to use accurate tax laws in their software! Turbo Tax is ignorant of the law and does not care! I now not only have to repay the credit but have been charged almost 20% in interest and penalties, which Turbo Tax says is not their responsibility.
I filed my taxes (federal and state) using the TurboTax online software for the 2009 tax year. Everything seemed fine and I electronically submitted my returns. However, the next time I logged in my refund amount had changed for no reason, indicating that I should have actually gotten $200 more in my federal refund. I waited for my refund to come through and sure enough, it was $200 short. I contacted TurboTax's customer service line multiple times trying to speak with anyone who could explain what happened, but was always on hold for an extended period of time (over an hour one time before my call was even answered by a live person) and then once my call was finally answered, the representatives offered no help nor explanation as to why my return was submitted incorrectly. I had to manually amend my returns from that year and have still not received the $200 I am owed. TurboTax reps offered no mention of this "guarantee" they claim to have and are no help to me in dealing with the IRS on this issue. I will never use TurboTax again!
The 2011 software will not load in my computer. I have used Turbo Tax for over 5 years and I never had a problem but this year it does not load and now I have spent $50 on this software that does not load. I want my money back from Turbo Tax.
I am married, filing to be "separated with dependent". It was supposedly very simple. I answered all the prompts it asked, and was informed I was due back a refund. Sad to say, I was hit by the IRS requesting for $500.00, and lo and behold, you cannot find a live person or email for Turbo Tax! It's a ghost site that takes your money. The IRS doesn't care that they have faulty programs, but claim 100 % guarantee. IRS accepts their business which needs to stop. I still at this moment cannot find a contact number or email to discuss my situation. Due to the faulty program, they should be required to reimburse the filing fee of $49.00, plus pay the IRS. They guaranteed it would be accurate.
My 2010 income tax was filed online and the choice was made to have my Federal and State returns loaded on a TurboTax Visa credit card (one for each return). Those cards were received and I was instructed to call the 1-800 number to activate the cards. After a week of attempting to get them activated, I was informed that the money was loaded as requested and available for me. However, when I took the cards to the bank, the teller told me that there was no money on the cards. I called TurboTax again and was told that the money was available. After a day, I took the cards to another bank and used the ATM on the Federal return card. The machine kept the card and shredded it. Shocked, I went to the teller and asked for her to explain why and to check the amount on the State return card. She said the amount was $0.00, the Bank Manager said that there was nothing she could do about the Federal return card and to contact TurboTax as she said many people have indicated to her that they have had problems with those cards. I cannot find a phone or mailing address to send my complaint to TurboTax with copies of the IRS and Colorado State documents showing the monies were sent on my behalf to the TurboTax account for the credit cards. I talked to an attorney who said to first write a letter with copies attached, but I have been unable to locate a customer service complaint department to submit my complaint to. Can you help?
After more than 10 years of using TTax for IRS and state filing, I placed an order for 2011 on their electronic order form which requested different information from previous years. This resulted in a different ID than in 2010 which was supplied to me on a CD successfully as all previous years. A paper delivery notice arrived last wk of Nov. 2011 but I was unable to download or even access my file to do so ( password/PIN does not match). A letter outlining my difficulty was sent to VP Bob Meighan requesting assistance. Today, no useable answer to the stated problem and today I received my credit card statement disclosing the amount paid even though the software is not accessible in my file. TTAx has sent me 4 temp. PIN is but none work. I have spent more than 4 hours trying to access my account (s) and the CPU states only available but will not process the download. Awaiting a personal assist in this or a useable email address to send communications to TTax. Signed a frustrated former TTAX user.
Turbo Tax charged me twice for one TurboTax software CD. I went online in a chat (Nov 15, 2011) and Turbo Tax told me that I would not be charged twice. However, I was charged in my October and November Visa statement. I am very angry. I will not include this charge in my Visa payment.
We had set it up for Turbo Tax to automatically register for each year. We were billed without notice last year, so we called them and told them we wanted to opt out of the automatic program. They canceled our subscription and refunded us the money. This year they did the same thing so I called and talked to them explaining to them we had canceled our subscription last year. They went back in the system, canceled it again and I received an email showing it was canceled and was told we were to be refunded the money within 3 business days. One the third business day we were recharged and it made us have a negative balance. We have now been charged for the program we were supposed to be credited for and were hit with overdraft fees.
I used TurboTax Premier 2010. The software allowed passive loss on rental property, even though the income was above $150K limit for couple.
My investigations point to the fact that Intuit sells/shares personal information to/with collection agencies. I filed my business/personal taxes online with TurboTax. Within a few weeks, I started getting calls from collection agencies (one in particular) about old, old accounts that these type of collection companies purchase for pennies then try to collect on. Both my wife and myself were contacted. Some of the information that they told us they could only have come from our most recent tax return, which we did through TurboTax, and this was the only year that we ever used TurboTax. I can't reveal, at this time, what key information that was revealed as we have been advised not to, but there were no other documents with this information available. At this point, I will not say that "TurboTax sells/shares your very private information,” but the evidence is mounting and I will report back to this board what the end conclusion/result is. Let the buyer beware.
In 2010, I used a free version of Turbo Tax (online) to complete my 2009 taxes. At that time of completing the taxes, I was only able to retrieve a cover page with turbo tax indicating the refund due to me and 4 other lines. The 1040EZ was not attached. I saved what was available to my computer and was grateful that I was receiving a refund. I received the refund as calculated by Turbo Tax. Now, a year later, I am being contacted by Internal Revenue, citing I owe them as the withholding amount was different than that indicated on my W2. It was incorrect - TT entered a different (higher) amount. When I contacted TT, they indicated that they only report what I enter in the computer. I have filed my taxes for the past 40 years, why did I have an error now? I requested the agent re-calculate giving him the figures, he too, came up with a different number than IRS or what they had previously reported. I do believe TT and IRS are in this scheme together in an effort to defraud those receiving refunds. I will write to the President regarding this action and have them investigate it. Now, I know why TT uses "get the largest refund." Here, I was thinking that they would assist me with obtaining credits I may have previously ignored. I will have the hard drive copied form my computer to determine if I can retrieve what I entered and consider a class action suit against TT,
I find my self both perplexed and very unpleased with some recent revelations about Turbo Tax. This would have been my seventh consecutive year to use the online version of Turbo Tax and probably 10th or 11th year, overall, using some version of Turbo Tax. Let me start by saying that I do completely understand that I have put myself in the quandary I currently face, but find it very, very hard to believe that I can be the only one or maybe one of a handful that has this same problem. I submitted an extension for my 2010 1040 return in April, got approved, wasted time, procrastinated and let life get in the way of me filing before the 10/17 deadline. And it also did not help that for whatever reason, I got in my head that I had until the 31st. Now that being said, I find it extremely disconcerting that the entire website (with the exception of the ability to download a PDF copy of prior year returns) is now unavailable until mid-December! I can understand shutting down e-file services, but no access whatsoever to the software for those of us who forgot about our returns? I understand that the CD-based version is available and that the updates to that version are available, but I like the ease of use, the ability to login from my home and work PCs to the same account, and the fact that all my prior year returns are in one place. That, obviously, will no longer be the case. What could possibly be the reason that I cannot use the online version to create a paper-filed late return? I used to work for a competitor of yours for many years (and still liked your version for 1040's much better) and the prior year software was always available for those who need to finish returns, amend returns, etc. Even if there was an 'extra' charge (which I would've been more than happy to pay). So as it was, I now had to hunt down a CD-based version (I was not going to download the version from your site for sixty bucks. Why would I pay sixty dollars? Which also took me by surprise! Yes, you have us over a bit of a barrel, but sixty bucks?). I found a local retailer that had it for much cheaper (about 85% cheaper), but again, this version is really only good for one machine and after I am done, you guys don't have a way for me to upload this return to my online account which is yet another problem that I have. But the straw, the straw was the fact that I left the comforts of my home and internet to buy a CD-based version of your software that I can really only use on one PC (without export/import, flash drives. Ugh) and complete a paper return that I won't be able to upload to my online account, which means I now have to make sure that I store this somewhere that I will not only remember, but be somewhat safe... and wham! The straw is that I cannot retrieve from my online account or your support organization or apparently anywhere, a version of my 2009 return to import for my 2010 return! If I were to have a PDF of a competitor's software, I could do it. But apparently, the PDFs that are available to me for your product cannot be imported into your product for the next years' return. And now that the entire system is shut down, there is no way for me to get my 2009 Turbo Tax return rolled into my 2010 Turbo Tax return. Impossible, I was told by your support. Wow. Yes, I know that I brought this on myself and that for those years that I used the product during the 'correct' times, I was fine. But I cannot believe that I now cannot access your website, complete a late paper filed return using your online software, store my completely inconvenient CD version paper filed return on my online account or even retrieve a version of my 2009 return for use in the completely inconvenient CD version. None of your direct competitors have any of these problems. Very disappointed.
They shutdown the electronic filing system prior to the final tax deadline. I could not use my "free" electronic filing. I now have to pay penalties because my return was late.
I selected via radio buttons the option to pay for and e-file my 2010 Federal Tax Return only. I also selected: Do not decide about State Tax now. But I was charged for both federal and state tax return preparation and e-filing. When this happened, it was after Intuit's telephone and chat services. There is no email option, so I cannot contact them today, and the tax filing deadline is today. I was not given the opportunity to review my order before Intuit went ahead with the wrong charge! I will call Turbo Tax as soon as possible to complain.
For the past 3 or 4 years after I started to use Turbo Tax to file my taxes, I started receiving lots of spam. It happens every year. At first, I thought it was a coincidence but I filed taxes late this year and the pattern of unwanted spam started. I indicate on everything I fill out that I do not want to receive email offers or anything else from partners. It really doesn't matter that I ask to keep my info private - my info gets distributed. I really wonder how safe my tax info is with Intuit because my info is not safe from spammers. Don't send me notes telling me you don't sell my info because consistent history with use of Turbo Tax indicates something else.
I just received a notice from the IRS that I owed approximately two thousand dollars plus interest. Turbo Tax gave me a payment (line 69) of excess social security credit, which I guess I am not entitled to but they computed it, so I knew no different. Turbo Tax offers no response.
In 2010, I was notified by the MA State Revenue Office that I owe them over $500.00 in fees and interest for the year 2007; because Turbo Tax put in the incorrect amount for my income even though it did have the correct income on the IRS Federal tax return. Can you imagine not being aware or notified that there was an error. Currently, I had to enter into a small fee arrangement to repay the state of MA for the 2007 tax return error with all its penalties. I attempted to contact Turbo Tax but no human operator was available. I could not find a class action suit to latch on either; this would at least let me collect on the penalties. Any information on a class action suit against Turbo Tax would be greatly appreciated. Hewitt representative stated that there was one but I could not locate it on the web. I just cannot believe that they are still in business and ripping people off with no consequences and that the tax lawyers are not biting to start a class action suit. I was never notified by Turbo tax that there were issues and now in 2011, I am paying for Turbo Tax's 2007 mistake.
I filed my 2010 taxes with Turbo Tax, as I have every year since 2000. I completed a foreign adoption in 2009, and took the tax credit of $12,150.00 for that year. For my 2010 taxes, TT calculated another adoption tax credit for different expenses, same adoption. It was my understanding that I could tax the tax credit to the extent of all adoption expenses, even if I had to take it over several years, so I thought this was correct. The IRS is penalizing me; I contacted audit support, that I paid for through TT - they did not even understand the problem, but said they would pursue an abatement of the penalty. The IRS refused the abatement. I called TT when I received the final communication from the IRS - the person on the phone went into my account and generated an amended return showing that the tax credit was withdrawn and tried to tell me that the program had worked that way all along! The program did not work that way when I did my taxes, resulting in a penalty and interest that TT is refusing to take responsibility for. It was their program that calculated the credit in the first place.
TurboTax doubled my income at the time of submission. This resulted in a huge tax bill that has yet to be refunded, as well as a penalty. TurboTax support either hangs up or says not to worry, the IRS will fix it. The IRS help line just laughed, as it is apparently an ongoing problem.
I got an IRS refund on 9/23/2011. It was a direct deposit from Santa Barbara bank to Turbo Tax in my name. I never received my card in the mail but got a deposit, so I called and put a block on the card to prevent any kind of problem with my refund. Somehow, your company put my money in a different name, **, which is my friend. We actually filled the refunds together. He also put a block because he never received his card and he went through H&R Block I've been given a wait period of ten business days to complete the investigation on the matter. I have bank statements on email stating they deposited the refund to my name with complete account numbers. I need immediate action on this matter if you value customer service. Thank you for your time and enjoy the rest of your day. God bless you.
In 2008, I used the free Turbo Tax online. I paid $5,300 in income tax and got over $3,000 back. Last year, after I filed my 2009 return with approximately the same refund, I got a letter from the IRS stating the tax I actually paid was less than what I reported on my return. I looked at my return and it showed $8,500. Because the 8 is just above the 5 on the number pad I figured I hit the wrong key. Since the amount of the 2009 refund was so close to 2008 I looked at what was filed and again it was $3,000 off. I pulled out my W2's and found that Turbo Tax added my Medicare & Social Security deductions to the taxes I paid and reported it all as taxes paid, causing the large refund. Not surprisingly, I just got another letter from the IRS wanting their money back, plus interest of course.
Turbo Tax was done for 2009 online. A fee of $49.95 was charged plus $29.95 to a third party, which was supposed to send refund of $1,300 to my regular savings account, but they never sent the refund. I am trying to find phone number for this bank but haven't been able to yet. They are University National Bank of Saint Paul, MN. I am hoping to find their number. I could really use this refund or find some way to handle this.
I just received a notice from the IRS that Turbo Tax added my husband's SS Medicare payment amount into my Federal Withholding amount, and now, I owe over $1,000 plus penalties. I will never use Turbo Tax again and will strongly discourage anyone else from ever using them again. This company should be looked into.
After purchasing a home in 2009, I used Turbo Tax to prepare my taxes. It allowed me to take the first time homeowners credit. This year, I found out that the IRS has audited my tax return and determined that I didn't qualify for the credit. Now, I owe the IRS almost $12,000. I have been unsuccessful in getting in touch with an actual person from Turbo Tax.
I just got a letter from IRS getting penalized for the amount of $3.637. Turbo Tax did not include a calculated report for 2009 in the following things: Unemployment compensations, non-employee compensation and state income tax refund. I followed the directions given by Turbo Tax for these things to be reported and yet IRS never received it, and now we are penalized for something that we did not do. This is definitely the last time I am using this software nor will I ever recommend it. I hope I don't get a bill for year 2010 now.
I will NEVER EVER, EVER use Turbo Tax again!!! I have been using the software since 2005 and instead of getting better with time it has become WORSE. To begin with, there is a survey that you fill out to determine which software is "best" for you. For whatever reason, the software decided that I needed "Home and Business" when I am an employee and not self-employed. So, I tried to go back to select the regular service on my own only to find out that you cannot change software once it decided for you which one to use. Then, trying to find a customer service number to get some kind of assistance is almost impossible. Finally, when speaking to someone, they are extremely rude and it takes time explaining over and over in order to overcome language barriers. They finally give you a discount code to use to credit the difference when you submit everything. After entering most of my information my Fed return showed something around $4,500. I logged out & logged back in about an hour or so later and my Fed return had been reduced to $3,040. I researched and researched, trying to figure out how it reduced so drastically when I hadn't changed anything. No indication of why that happened so I went ahead and submitted everything, thinking Turbo Tax found something and updated with the correct amount. At the end I was billed again for the service on top of the amount that I prepaid in the beginning when I filed for an extension, so I was charged double. The system would not allow me to enter the code showing that I already paid so I had to go through the same customer service shenanigans all over again to get some kind of help. I still ended up paying more for the service than I was supposed to but they said there was nothing that they could do about it. This whole get-your-money-in-8-days is **. They only tell you after you have paid and filed that the IRS only gives refunds on Fridays so expect to get your refund the 1st Friday, after 1-2 days for IRS to accept, and 7 days after the acceptance. I received mine about 13 days later. A month later, I logged in just to get my daughter's ssn off of one of the forms and all of a sudden the refund calculator has reduced to $2,479. I haven't changed anything, I haven't done anything but click on my daughter's name and the calculator got to calculating and changed my information to say that I got a refund of this new amount. This is not true and now I am worried on a calculator that thinks on its own, that I did not get the maximum possible refund, and maybe I was owed the original $4,500. Of course, I cannot reach anyone in customer service to help me. This software is far from reliable and all I know is I better not get a notice from the IRS of anything wrong as if they overpaid me or something. I will be sure to post this any and everywhere I can to expose them and find out who else is being ripped off and penalized by the IRS because of this unreliable software. I will pay a professional next time.
I used Turbo Tax software to do my 2009 taxes and input my retired pay but the software did not print out the correct amount on the tax papers submitted to IRS. So I'm getting hit with penalties and interest. And the so-called 100% accurate guarantee is **. They won't do anything except give me the runaround.
Filed my 2009 Income Taxes online. Received Electronic Filing Instructions which state "Your federal tax return (Form 1040) you've selected to pay your balance due in installments. The Installment Agreement Request has been electronically filed with your tax return..." Approximately a month ago, I received notification from the IRS that our 2009 taxes has NOT been filed.
TurboxTax 2009 software did not report three stock transaction I entered to IRS. I can see the transactions within the data entry grid themselves but the data would not print nor were they transmitted to IRS.
I used Turbo Tax to file my 2009 tax returns. It failed to report my unemployment income as taxable, and I now am getting hit with back taxes, interest and a huge penalty because their software is defective.
I received a letter from the IRS saying that I owe them 2009 taxes. The biggest problem is regarding my income tax withheld, which I had none, since I was a consultant in the entire year and did not receive any W-2. However, TurboTax 2009 magically came up with a number "12428" at my tax withheld field; and when I reviewed the numbers, I could not figure out how it came up with that number. I was unable to modify or erase that number (I tried to enter a W-2 with 0 and it didn't work). So now, I have to spend several additional days to rectify the situation and to pay the IRS money and penalty. I will not use TurboTax in the future; and I'll make sure that all my contacts understand this defective software designed by this incompetent company.
On Friday, 05/13/2011, I used my TurboTax card at For Eyes Optical located at 11920 SW 88th Street, Miami, Fl. I used it to pay for the independent doctor services and for the glasses. On Monday, 05/16/2011, I went to the Century Bank ATM location to withdraw in order to pay bills. The balance was only $175. I signed on to the account to discover that my money was used to purchase travel/hotel/and vacation spots out of USA and not by me. I attempted to speak to any individual at the "customer service" number. After a long struggle and emotional upset, the card was cancelled. Seven days later, I received a new card and went to check if the issue had been resolved. Not only was it not but now I was being charged with foreign fees and lost fees totaling $ 35.18. At the only point that a human voice spoke to me was to tell me that I should contact the companies that accepted the charges. This issue remains unresolved. I was a victim and nobody is helping. Close to $ 900 disappeared from my account without my authorization and your company has made no efforts to refund or restore the money. Unacceptable!
I paid for the service (TurboTax Premier) up front. I did this because I have used the same service in the past and it worked fine. I received the return accepted with the software, but it actually was rejected. I did not receive an e-mail stating this. I hope that Intuit would hope to square up how they have actually taken money from folks and not provided service. Whispers are there is an ambulance chaser in Nevada making a decent class action complaint. I actually do my taxes myself most of the time. The first two years you guys did well. Hope you get back on track! Thanks for the first two good years of excellent service! Now, if you go away--oh well.
Prepared my 2009 taxes online. First year reporting Social Security income on my husband. Got a letter on June 16, 2011 that I had understated the SS. I pulled up my return and it clearly shows the amount I put in is correct but where the program pulled the number used is a mystery. I now have to pay the IRS $1,047 by July 13th 2011. I strongly urge everyone not to use Turbo Tax if they want their return done correctly.
I filed my 2009 income tax using TurboTax Deluxe. I completed all of the information and thought everything was fine. I was recently notified that I did not report all of my pension income. Upon checking I saw that I included all of the income, but the TurboTax software rounded it off by reporting only $92.00 of income instead of the $9,195 that I received. I was required to pay $134 in late fees. I notified TurboTax about the problem, but they have done nothing. If you are considering using TurboTax, I would strongly suggest that you review your return completely before submitting. I am out $134 in late fees and TurboTax has not offered to reimburse me for their software error.
I just received notice from IRS that my 2009 return stated excess Social Security tax in the amount of over $4000 and the IRS wants it back with interest. This was a TT calculation that I did not catch and now I'm stuck with the problem. TT did not notify me of the error. I think a class action is in order here.
I filed my 2010 taxes by using turbotax.com and was due a refund of $200. I received a notice from IRS advising I owe $481.00. I am not eligible to claim child and dependent care expenses because my filing status is married/filing separately. So I sit on hold waiting to speak with the IRS and see what to do. So, Turbo Tax claims 100% accurate calculations guaranteed! Yet when you try to contact them, you will find there is no email, no phone number and they keep rerouting you back through reading material only. Basically, it's a phantom website with no employees or customer service. I'm about to burn them. I will continue to file complaint after complaint with Tallahassee you name it.
The IRS says Line 14b of my 2009 1040A did not match information they had on file. TurboTax entered: $4,405; the reported amount to IRS: $6735. Now, I owe them additional taxes plus interest.
Turbo Tax ** me. I filed online back in January (end of) and Turbo Tax reported my taxes wrong to the I.R.S. It has been a nightmare since that day of filing with them. They didn't report the tax withheld as I received a confirmation from them that due to me was $565. However, the I.R.S. states that their form shows that I owe $788. They are liars and I want to be part of a class action lawsuit against them, if possible. They guarantee that the filing is100% accurate when it is really not!
I just received a notice from NY State Taxation and Finance that I owe from my 2008 taxes. I used Turbo Tax and the software didn't add my retirement contribution on the correct line. I now owe the state with interest. My mother, who also used Turbo Tax, got the same notice regarding an error on her taxes. Not so sure I will use Turbo Tax again.
Back in 2008, we filed with Turbo Tax. My husband's IRA distribution was taxed an extra$ 4000 on an $8000 distribution. Turbo Tax has not contacted us to correct the error. We have sent several emails and made several calls and no one at Turbo Tax will help nor listen.
I discovered after e-filing that Turbo Tax computed an incorrect taxable portion of my social security benefit. Over $10,000 above what should have resulted. I spent 90 minutes on the phone with their CS people, including an accountant who agreed that the result of the computation was inconsistent with the data that shows on the pertinent lines of the 1040 that TT computed. I cold not amend the return until after the IRS got a huge amount above what I should have owed and the TT program continues to compute the same error. Meaning, the software probably created this whatever error is going on lots of people's returns. I probably will have to make the correction by hand and will then contact them to reimburse me the costs of the error. They should correct the software and notify 100% of the customers who use it to double check the computation, which I did using an online calculator. I only noticed that there was an error because I did not know that they now tax social security. When I looked into the huge % of mine that was taxed with little other income, I found the error.
My mom called due to the lack of competence in the company. She was calm and the guy was not helping. He proceeded on saying obviously, my mother could not read. He made her extremely upset so I took the phone and I asked him for her number. He proceeded on laughing at me and said people like me do not get the head manager's number. He called me names and said he would hang up on me, so I said "go right ahead and I would call right back". I do not appreciate his attitude at all.
I recently received a letter from the State of Iowa saying that I had been refunded too much on my 2008 state taxes. Iowa claimed that I had entered a $4,000 tuition tax credit, which was denied. However, when I looked at my pdf of my 2008 returns from TurboTax - everything was correct. TurboTax listed my total taxes/credits as $718 and a refund due of $529. But what Iowa received listed a tax credit and a request for a refund of $718. There is a major problem with the software/electronic transmission. What was e-filed by TurboTax was not the same as what they told me they were e-filing. TurboTax representatives are very difficult to deal with and "pretend" like they can't imagine what's going on and have never heard about this issue. That is a boat load of lies. The Iowa tax auditor told me that she has seen many, many e-filers who have had major errors on their tax returns when using TurboTax. Not only will I never be so foolish as to rely on TurboTax again, but I will also take every opportunity to warn everyone I know!
Error 123 is displayed when launching or using TurboTax 2010. This is a known issue with Turbo Tax and they released it with the failure. After 5 hours of trying fixes with several of their "help" people, I requested a refund as I had just purchased the program. Isaac gave me an address to send my receipt. The address was rejected as invalid; however, he did get me off the phone with him.
For the past few years, I have used Intuit Tax for my tax filing since I make less than $17,000 annual income from all sources. Intuit Turbo tax was free including my state tax return. They ripped me off this year for $56.70 since they already had all of my personal info from past years and no basic changes in my income or situation. I feel Intuit Turbotax is claiming to file people's income for free, especially those with low incomes and then socking it to them at the end, in order to complete their tax filing.
I have found the turbo tax system to be very troublesome and will never use this income tax system again. I will be sure to report all the complications I had to all I my friends, family and patients. I was not able to make changes once I had initially entered information and because of this, kept getting a Warning before I was able to file my return. Filing my return was even more trouble that after paying $27 to use the site, another $45$for audit defense. I almost went to H& R block to file my return.
I used the online Turbotax to prepare my 2008 state and federal returns. The program took my retirement income from my 1099r, but did not include the amount as taxable income. The IRS caught it and assessed interest on the additional taxes due. I turned to Intuit on their tax guarantee, and they responded that it was my error, not theirs.
On the Turbo Tax website, I was trying to use my login information from last year. I had filed free on the website the year before. This year, when I chose to e-file for free as a qualified low-income person, it is automatically redirecting me to Turbo Tax deluxe and trying to charge me for it. I am well below the income bracket to qualify for free e-filing and need to keep all the money I am going to get from my return. The messed up part is that the program led me through the entire process without letting me know about the charges for the deluxe version that amounted to about 70 dollars until the end, prompting me about how I was going to choose to pay. I may have seen it was the deluxe version sooner had I looked more closely at the web page, but I wasn't even expecting the redirection to the deluxe version when I originally selected the free one. It was frustrating because I was almost completely finished with my tax return, and now I'm going to have to start over somewhere else.
TurboTax made an error on my mom's 2008 taxes. Much like several customers here, it was regarding her IRA distribution and she now owes the IRS over $17,000! TurboTax has admitted the error was their fault (see email below) and promised to refund interest and penalties. However, they never sent the check! It's now been over 7 weeks and my mom has not received a dime and they refuse to answer any emails! We will be contacting an attorney as they admitted to the error, and still have not paid. If there's an attorney out there that wants to take our individual case, feel free to contact us. Clearly, TurboTax had a significant error in their 2008 software. Someone really needs to review these complaints and start a class action suit. I will do whatever I can to help. Email from TurboTax: I have reviewed your request for reimbursement for interest and/or penalties paid to the Internal Revenue Service for tax year 2008. I have determined that the TurboTax Software did not meet the standards we expect to make it easy for a user to correctly complete this type of return. Based on the terms of our Accuracy Guarantee, Intuit will reimburse you $3,431.00 for the interest/penalties you paid to the Internal Revenue Service. Please allow us 2 to 3 weeks to process the check. My mom has had a tremendous amount of emotional and financial damage from the error. Now it has increased with TurboTax's admission of the error, and they still do not respond, nor have they refunded the interest and penalties. My mom has suffered emotional and physical harm due to triggering her fibromyalgia.
I was filing 2010 taxes for my 21 year old that had under $8000 income and no deductions, property, etc. We used the free version last year for 2009. Using last year's login it automatically switched us to the deluxe version, charging $29.95 before it would let me file federal or print. (We chose not to file state with them because of the extra fee.) There was no warning or indication that this would occur. Is this bait and switch legal? How about a class action suit against the company?
I filed my 2010 tax return this year with Turbotax, as I have for several years past. I had expected my refund today, February 11. However, when I checked my checking account, the money was not in there. I had to check a secondary company's website, which informed me I had to contact Turbotax regarding my refund. When I called the 800 number provided, the "gentleman" on the other end of the line informed me, in no uncertain terms, that Turbotax had incorrectly filed an entire batch of refunds and as a result, I would be receiving my refund via check. The "gentleman" also informed me that there was no recourse, nor was there anything that could be done on their end. This is frustrating for multiple reasons: namely, that I had to contact Turbotax to find out about my refund. They obviously knew about this issue, as there is a FAQ topic on it on their website. The only saving grace was, he informed me that I would not be charged for using Turbotax this year. I will never use this company's products or services again.
The night before my tax refund was to go into my bank account, I got an e-mail saying they had a processing error, causing my refund not to go into my account. They told me that the I.R.S will mail me my check. Now, instead of having my money when they told me it would go into my account, I have to wait 7 to 10 days now. I have bills due and no money to pay them.
Just add me to the list. It seems like 2008 was a bad year for turbo tax users. I have read so many stories just like mine--unreported income from 1099-R. It seems like people entered the amount from 1099-R income and it was submitted as nontaxable income by turbo tax. Thus, you now owe the taxes on that unreported income--more than $4,200 in my case. Lots of people, lots of money. Class action lawsuit, I am in.
I also received a letter from the IRS, Turbo Tax double the mortgage interest I entered. I now owe the IRS. I had to borrow money to get this paid during a time when my unemployment just ran out.
I've used TurboTax for many years and not had any problems. But now that I've been "bitten", like the rest of you, I'll never use it again. Although TurboTax claims to be experts in state tax laws, they screwed up my 2007 state tax return big time because of my 401K contributions. In PA, believe it or not, 401K contributions are counted as taxable income (I didn't know this until after this TurboTax fiasco). But I worked in Delaware - where 401K contributions are tax exempt, so my adjusted gross income in DE did not include these 401K contributions, i.e. this amount was subtracted from my gross to arrive at my adjusted gross income. But TurboTax never checked. So, when I filed my PA tax, TurboTax just took the adjusted gross income amount from DE and plopped it into the adjusted gross income line for PA. So I ended up owing taxes on more income than was reported - plus penalties and interest for 3 years! In my opinion, TurboTax is worth it until you're one of the ones affected by their incompetency, and then it's not anymore. Beware!
On November 9 while checking my bank account, I noted a recurring withdrawal for $64.15 from Intuit. I called the number listed and talked to a representative who told me I never authorized an automatic renewal and should not have been charged. I called Suntrust Bank and they sent through a disputed request. The next day, that charge was not on my account. However on November 19, ten days after the representative from Intuit told me they would refund my money and cancel the Turbo Tax Advantage, I was again charged for $64.15 on my account. I called the number listed again. After a lengthy menu and much confusion, I talked to ** who could not understand English, could not find my account, and kept asking me for an order number even though I explained several times that I did not order anything. She told me a CD had been recently mailed to me, which I have not received. I then talked to "a supervisor" who again told me I would receive a credit in my account within the next 3-5 days. My question is this, "Why would they again charge my account 10 days after my first phone call and why would they mail me a CD several days after my first phone call unless they are trying to slip this through my account?" My account was charged on two separate occasions. Their customer service is located in India and is very difficult to deal with. I also used several minutes of air time on my cell phone.
I received a notice from the IRS saying I owe $458.00 for my 2008 tax return filed with TurboTax. I have requested nearly 3 weeks ago to have TurboTax review the calculating error the software made and have not heard a word. I put in the exact amount of of my 1099-g and the software added 10% tax to my total tax withheld, which then caused an additional overpayment in my refund. When I reviewed my documents and tax return vs what the IRS shows to be the actual amount, one can clearly see the error TurboTax software made. I now owe IRS $458.00.
I have my turbotax online account. Recently when I tried to logged into my account, my password was not working. I tried to reset the password and I noticed turbotax is sending password reset link to some different email address. It was not my registered email address. So the issue is someone hacked into online turbotax account, changed the registered email address, changed the security questions. By doing this they got hands on all my 10 years tax document, which consist of my and my son social security number and other confidential information. To my surprise turbotax.com did not even send me email before making such a big changes and still they do not have any record about my email address in that particular account. I am questioning major security flaws in turbotax.com product.
Turbo Tax On Line computed, we had paid excess Social Security tax and entered a credit on our 2008 federal return. Letter from IRS arrived 11-12-2010. It seems Turbo Tax combined social security tax paid (we both work) on our W2's to my husband. The government now wants the money back. I trusted Turbo Tax to compute the information entered correctly. We have never had any problems with our taxes before not in 43 years. We will find someone else to do our taxes in the future. It seems 2008 was a bad year for mess ups at Turbo Tax as we weren't the only ones the happened to. I will never use them again. I contacted the IRS by phone and the lady gave me the amount plus interest we owed as the letter from the IRS said, they would send us a bill in 4 to 8 weeks (while the interest kept adding up.) We swallowed hard and paid the balance owed the same day we found out we owed it. The IRS doesn't care who messed up they just want thier money.
Turbotax failed to update software on Domestics Partnership law that changed reporting from head to household, to married failing, joint or separate. IRS is billing me for underpaying taxes when I have never been audited before.
I filed my 2008 returns (Federal & NYS) with TurboTax. When reporting a distribution from my retirement account the taxable amount (box 2) was rounded to $13 when it should've been the same amount as the distribution in box 1. At first I thought I made the mistake but I've been preparing taxes for over 20 years and I never use punctuations (comma or period) when entering numbers; therefore, I can only deduct that the TurboTax software rounded the number. There was no error warning either. I received a notice from the IRS that the amount reported was different from the information they had received, low and behold, I owe the IRS several thousand dollars.
I used TurboTax to prepare my 2008 tax returns. I bought a house in September of 2008 and qualified for the first time homebuyer "tax credit". TurboTax failed to inform me that this is not a credit! That it is in fact an interest free loan that I have to pay back within 15 years. I didn't get any messages informing me or sign anything agreeing to pay this "tax credit" back. There was no way for me to know that the $3420 "tax credit" was actually a loan and I can't afford to pay it back! I do not have an extra $228 a year. I'm already barely staying above my student loan debt! I was hoping to get out of my house soon so that I could move closer to my job. But that's not going to happen now because I'll have to pay the IRS an extra $3400 if I sell it. I'll be lucky just to break even on my mortgage if I can sell the place. If there's any legal responsibility on the part of TurboTax for not informing me of this, I would really like to know. A credit is not the same as a loan!
When I filed my 2008 taxes, I noticed that the amount printed with my 2008 extension $850.00 vs $2000.00 was incorrect, but I was unable to correct it. I did it manually and submitted it. I did receive my refund. However, the Turbo Tax copy of my state tax was not changed. Now, the IRS are requesting more money. I can produce my records to explain this. However, since Turbo Tax imports information from previous years, I have been unable to complete my 2009 filing. I have not been able to get help because there is no phone contact.
My story is much the same as the ones I've read here. I did my 2008 taxes using Turbo Tax. All seemed fine until two years later when I received the notice from the IRS that I owed them $600 for not reporting state tax refund income and retirement income. I looked at my copy of the return printed from Turbo Tax and the state refund is clearly there on my copy, but not on the one the IRS got. Class action suit sounds like a pretty good idea to me. I also find it disturbing that, when I pulled up this consumer affairs page to read complaints about Turbo Tax, the first thing I see at the top is an ad for Turbo Tax along with a link to their web page! Apparently I'm going to be out $600, plus penalties and interest of course because I can't pay it lump sum. This is obviously Turbo Tax's fault and a lot of people have been affected. Please, someone file a suit! I'm on board!
I'm complaining about Turbo Tax! I received a notice from IRS about 2008 taxes. They say it is wrong and want more money, thousands more. I am tired of all these problems caused by Turbo Tax. I need some help here, how do I get it instead of the run-around!

I received an under-reporting letter from the IRS for my 2008 taxes in May 2010. The funny thing, I allowed a friend to use my turbo tax and she too received the same under-reporting letter for 2008. I contacted the IRS and they explained that the amount I claimed on my retirement income was different from what "I reported." I went back into Turbo Tax to see if I had entered the wrong information and I didn't. I checked the form that was submitted and the entry was different. I am angry because I have never owed IRS. I am always careful when dealing with my returns. Now I owe almost $2600! Why did it take so long for IRS to find out about this under-reporting. I was convinced there was something wrong with Turbo Tax or the IRS system in 2008 because I had never heard of so many people in my inner circle having problems with their 2008 taxes. Now, seeing others in the same situation, I know I am not alone! I agree, I hope a class action is filed!
I cannot get a support person on the phone. No number available but site says "Help by Chat," (a computer which gives directions/path that does not work) and "Call for Help" does not have a phone number listed but says call back pacific time. But there is no phone number listed! Cannot complete my taxes or run off copy. I have completed so far. I am desperate without a support phone number as promised. It is Oct. 1 and if my taxes are not in by 15th, I will get a fine. I have completed over 50% of them online but cannot get past one spot to access form for retirement pension and social security income. Will only let me access 'wages and income (from a job!)
I used Turbo Tax 2008. I printed out the forms before e-filing. Everything was correct. I got a letter from the IRS stating that there I owed $601 due to the incorrect amount was entered for my income tax. I rechecked the amount on my original printout. It was correct. When I went to print it again from Turbo Tax, the amount was e-filed with the incorrect amount. This was a software error on Turbo Tax's side.
I used online Turbo Tax for my federal return in 2008. I received a refund. Now, the IRS has sent me a letter stating information was omitted and I now owe them $550.00. This is not right. I fully answered all questions that were asked and the information was determined to be correct by their "error check". Turbo Tax's position is that it was my fault. It makes no sense and I will never use their service again.
I prepared my 2008 taxes through TurboTax. I received a notice from the IRS that what I reported in my returns did not match what was reported to the IRS. I went back and checked my tax documents, and was not able to find the discrepancy. There has to be a glitch in the 2008 Turbo Tax software.
I had TurboTax do both my federal and state tax return for 2008. In July 2010, I received a notice from the IRS stating I owed $1,265.00 for my federal taxes!!! I tried contacting TurboTax to get a few questions answered concerning my 2008 tax preparation. The individual I talked to at TurboTax stated "we only report what you have given us! You should have paid the extra fee to cover this problem". I am retired and I declared 37,600.00 on my tax form, which was money drawn from my retirement account. But for some reason TurboTax tables online shows 2678.00 and according to the IRS should have been 3878.00. So with penalties, it is now 1265.00. I did not feel that the TurboTax representative was the least concerned about this situation!! I am very disappointed since I felt they were supposedly knowledgeable in tax preparation plus the forms the IRS sent are very confusing and threatening. This is the first time in all my adult life that I ever had a problem with my tax return. Plus it has had an effect on me, both mentally and physically and I had heart surgery over two years ago. Now I have to come up with 1265.00 and pay or else the interest will keep accumulating.
I used TurboTax to figure my 2008 Federal and State tax returns and I received a notice from my Georgia State Department of Revenue that the amount of deductions on my State return did match my Federal deductions for that same year. I went back and double and triple checked. I printed out both and they matched as they should. I sent these copies to the GA Department of Revenue and showed them that there was some mistake! After several demand letters, and now, a FiFa letter threatening to garnish my wages, I believe that there was a glitch in the software! There has to be! I am like everyone else in today's economy and work force who has either been laid off or has taken a tremendous cut in salary--20% to be exact! I need some help with this matter because as you know, late fees and interest is accruing in favor of the GA Department of Labor. I just can't pay it! Please help me!
I just received a letter from the State of MI regarding my 2006 return owing just shy of a thousand dollars. This is due to a return I paid Turbo Tax to do correctly but they did not do correctly. I am aware that the 2007 returns were grossly incorrect as well, making me owe thousands more than the initial return stated. It was caught by the state immediately so there were no large penalties and interest due. It's frustrating to have paid for a program to do the taxes and to have the IRS and State coming back for more money. I entered information exactly as asked, Turbo Tax did the inaccurate calculations. I have no problem paying the tax itself. It's my responsibility. I do want my money back for the 2006 and 2007 returns that they miscalculated! I also want the money for penalties and interest that is owed on my 2006 return.
TurboTax calculated state taxes for four years on a qualified tax exempt pension. After finding the error, amended state returns were filed. Living in one of the most money-strapped states in the nation, at this time, who knows when this overpayment will be returned to us. TurboTax may be easier to use than dragging the paperwork to a preparer, but I will not use them again. I could certainly use the almost $10,000 in overpayment.
I used TurboTax to file my 2008 return. My wife received money from her mother’s retirement account when she passed away and taxes were taken out prior to filing taxes for the year. We enter the amount that was in the account and how much was taken out for taxes from the form 1099, but the amount taken out for taxes did not appear on the tax return when filed. I now owe the IRS $1500 and TurboTax says that since I can't prove it was program error then, there's nothing they will do.
I used Turbo Tax thru the IRS website to file my 2008 tax return. I received a notice from the IRS yesterday, telling me I had an error on my return in the amount of 500 plus dollars in their favor. I checked and I entered my earnings, distributions, and interest correctly from my W-2' and 1099's. IS Turbo tax obligated for any of the error? Thank you.
Turbo Tax 2008 doubled the taxes in Schedule A, resulting in an error. I owe $4500 to the IRS that were not reflected on the 1040 I filed using Turbo Tax.
I received a letter from the IRS stating that there was an error on my 2009 federal taxes. I should have known better, but the automatic calculations of TurboTax leave no margin other then entering requested information into designated boxes. I am not sure what extent of damages that I will have to repay, but the bottom line is that I will never trust TurboTax again. It's so sad that such a once reputable product is now flawed and unworthy! My personal opinion of this product is that it is purposely flawed to generate income for the IRS! After viewing this website, it became clear that maybe over a million people using TurboTax were intentionally ripped off in a very elusive way! How many people will not be able to repay all of the overpayment back on time, which will lead to millions of interest charges, no different from credit cards? The funniest thing about TurboTax is that prior to starting a return the required acceptance disclaimer relieves them of all liabilities associated with product error. Like I mentioned earlier "rip-off" tactics to create income for the IRS. Just my opinion through observation of all these smart Okole rip-off businesses nowadays. I'll know my damages when the IRS sends me their corrected version along with my IOU and penalty fees if I can't repay ASAP. Yeah right!!!
IRS is now saying I owe money because of a miscalculation by TurboTax. We are on Social Security because of the modified AGI plus fifty percent of benefits are greater than $32,000. I entered all the income and your software did the calculations and the IRS says you are wrong. Help. Must pay taxes and penalty.
I used TurbowTax 2008 to do my taxes. I just received a letter from the IRS saying I owe $2800 for 2008 because the return showed a deduction of $13,000 Federal Tax withheld by my employer instead of the $10,500 I entered on the form. I tested the withholding field by changing the amount and, again, the wrong amount was transferred to the 1040. I'll find another program to use next time and I'll be sure to double check the information transferred to the 1040.
Just an update, I have a small claim against Turbotax for not calculating my retirement income as taxable both in 2007 and 2008. Now, I owe the IRS over $14,000 and the state $6,500. Bob the VP of Intuit says this is not a legit site and complaints here are just people complaining. Don’t give up. File a small claim against them. The online software version does not put retirement income in the right place.
Turbo Tax did my taxes for 2009, federal and state. In June of 2010, I received a message from the State of Wisconsin that the report was incorrect and I owed $152.00. I have tried to contact Turbo Tax, but there does not seem to be any way to do it. I am a senior citizen raising a child on a limited income and the State is now attaching my wages for this tax problem.
I received a letter stating I owe $3602 for 2009 taxes from IRS. Apparently, Turbotax doubled the over-withheld social security taxes. I have to email them, to no response. I have searched for a phone number and there is none. I have looked every where for a good address. I will never purchase this product again!
I just received a bill from the IRS, against my 2008 taxes, which I filed using Turbo Tax, as I have done over the last decade, with maybe one exception. I owe money and interest, because my husband's, and my social security withholdings, were reported incorrectly, as if we had overpaid (Max SSI withholding is approximately $6,400). This usually happens if you have more than 1 job in a year, which neither of us did. Anyway, we received that overpayment as part of our refund, and when IRS verified against the W-2 data (which we downloaded automatically from the payroll service provider to Turbo Tax online), they found the error, and now I have to pay. I've contacted Turbo Tax via email, and all I've received is a survey about the experience, but no one has contacted me about my problem. From the looks of other posts here and elsewhere on the internet, I doubt I'll get any restitution or response to help me out. I owe the IRS more then $2,600, that they overpaid me in my refund, due to this error!
Just rec'd letter from IRS stating that we underpaid 2008 taxes by not claiming pension income from form 1099R. Pulled my e-return and see that it was entered as income but was calculated by TurboTax as not taxable. I run the audit scan every year when I use TurboTax and there were no issues/no red flags. What happened to their guarantee to backup their product in cases of software error such as this. Owe and additional $563.00 plus interest.
I received an e-mail message that said that many of the Turbo Tax customers "may" have double reported Medicare Part B and Part D payments for the tax year 2009. I checked and I had double reported those amounts. They suggested that they check 2007 and 2008 as well. The same thing happened in all three years. I think the problem is that when working on 1099 reporting, we are asked about the form that comes from the SSA and directed to place that amount in a given box on a given worksheet. Later, we are asked to report all medical premium payments. I reported each year my costs for supplemental insurance, for my wife's COBRA coverage and then added in Medicare Part B and Part D payments. I was not aware that by doing so, a double reporting would occur. Later, when each year's return is complete, you are asked to run it through a check. Each year I did so and each year it said all was okay. Now I'm told that it was "user error." I don't believe that is correct and I asked Turbo Tax to consider help with the resulting tax liability. They said they were helping by assisting with filing an Amended Return, but that they had no financial liability. Again, I told them I thought that was wrong, but I am filing Amended Returns and attaching checks for both Federal and State returns. I am not pleased with this result. I'm done with this, I hope, unless there is a class action suit filed. The amount in question is not sufficient to go this alone. The total amount I am required to pay in Federal and State taxes is $833. I am not yet aware whether anyone will seek penalties and/or interest.
I did my 2008 taxes using Turbo (used several other years). I received a letter from IRS saying I owe $19,000. The entries for pension, IRA, and social security were all entered right but the amounts were not brought forward. I am disabled and on a fixed income. I will never use them again!
I read from your previous complaints about Turbo Tax 2008. I also recently received a letter from the IRS stating I owe $2400 because the Annuities/pension income was not added to my AGI; therefore I received too much earned income and child tax credit. I check and recheck my returns before I submit to make sure everything is correct! The income is shown on my 1040 form but apparently in the wrong box! The 1040 also reflects the federal income I paid on the pension. Why didn't Turbo Tax catch this error before submitting the form to the IRS and why didn't the IRS catch it before they accept my return and issued me a refund! I am a single mother barely making ends meet and there is no way I can afford to pay back $2400!! Has anyone that has been affected by this been able to contact Turbo Tax regarding this matter? I plan to try to write the IRS and explain what happened and pray that they show me some compassion. I will never use Turbo Tax again!! I am an honest working American and file my taxes honestly every year! There has to be a way to hold Turbo Tax responsible for the error in their software that we all trusted.
I filed my 2008 return with TurboTax. When calculating my eligibility for income-based credits (Earned Income and Additional Child), the TurboTax online software added 10,987 (10-9-8-7, a string of descending numbers) to the amount I entered as earned income. Thus, my credit was increased by 2,400 which I accepted in good faith. Now the IRS wants their money back. The same software also increased the amount of tax withheld claimed by $840. So I'm being hounded for $3400, and I have no way of paying it back. I am unemployed, and am raising an autistic daughter (wife not working to stay home). I've attempted to contact the media, but it appears that they do not care. Furthermore, the bigger question is: How many tax dollars are being given out (and accepted in faith) in this time where everyone is worried about government spending? How many eligible people are not receiving credits due because the system declares them ineligible? This has the potential to be a huge fiasco, and might even cross into the Ponzi scheme territory.
In September 2009, I received a bill from the Franchise Tax Board for $371 from 2008. What happened next is unbelievable: I called Turbo Tax and they said it wasn't their fault. Whose fault was it that they did not carry over my numbers to the California portion of my return? I called the Accuracy Guarantee dept. but they don't take calls. I have called and e-mailed since 5/18/10. They said it would take three weeks to call me back. You received a call like I received a call. No call was ever received, but ridiculous e-mails arrived in my inbox and there was no follow-through.
I have had the same issues with the 2008 TurboTax pension under-reporting thing. I was notified by the IRS that I owed an additional $4700.00 because I had under-reported. I checked the return and found TurboTax had erroneously not carried over the income despite the information being there. Apparently, there is nothing that can be done and the IRS does not care.
I am concerned about the "bait and switch" technique that Intuit TurboTax uses on-line for returning customers. A returning customer (one that has previously filed using TurboTax Free Edition on-line, such as myself) is automatically switched to the Deluxe Edition (costing $49.95). The only indication that the customer has been switched from the Free Edition to the Deluxe Edition is a change in the small TurboTax logo icon in the upper left corner of the screen. In my case, I chose the free edition as always, didn't notice I had been switched to the Deluxe Edition and wasn't informed of the switch, laboriously worked through dozens of unnecessary forms and schedules, and didn't find out I was being charged $49.95 until I was ready to E-file. Reviewing the TurboTax FAQs, I find that I am not alone in being a victim of this bait and switch technique. I was informed (as were others with the same problem) that the only way for a returning customer to avoid the switch to the Deluxe Edition was to create a new account (new user name and password) and start over. The disadvantage of this is that all the basic info from previous year's returns is not carried forward. I have complained to the Florida Dept. of Consumer Affairs. In their replies to my complaint, Intuit/TurboTax seems to deny that returning customers are automatically switched to the Deluxe Edition even though the customer signs on to use the Free Edition. They claim the customer is always given a clear choice and an option to upgrade, but this is not the case. I am continuing to submit documentation to support my claims that returning customers that have used nothing but the Free Edition for federal returns in past years and who chose to use the Free Edition for 2009 returns are automatically upgraded to the Deluxe Edition without clear notification of the upgrade. I welcome all others to join in a class action lawsuit in regard to this nefarious bait and switch technique by Intuit/TurboTax.
We were notified by the IRS that we owed $4,796.00 from the 2008 tax year, because we omitted income from pensions and annuities. We clearly did enter all the 1099's, we received in regards to the pension and annuities. We called Turbo Tax and asked them to please tell us where and how the calculations were made. They said there is no way to ever check that and all they have is the PDF file of the completed tax forms.We don't understand how they can't figure out from their own software how the figures were calculated. We are already in a hole trying to dig out and now we don't know how we can afford to pay the IRS $5,000. We wonder how much we'll owe the state of NJ when they find out.
Today, the IRS sent me a bill for $1100 in additional 2008 taxes. As I had for a decade, I entered my tax information for 2008. However, reviewing the 2008 return today, the "Pension" line - 16a shows the amount entered from the 1099R I received but 16b shows only 10% of that amount as taxable income. Who is wrong, TurboTax or the IRS?
By reading the comments of the writers about Turbo Tax 2008, I have the same problem. It has to do with retirement funds, 1099-R. The 2008 version did not claim the amount as taxable. I did not know that until I called the IRS and they explained it to me. I went back to the 2008 version to see if I made a mistake but because Turbotax does not do it line by line, I could not correct the error. Because of the 1099-R error, it also created an error with Social Security funds and what is taxable. I was billed by the IRS for not reporting the correct income, which increased my taxes with penalties and interest for $11,000. As a retiree, it has caused a hardship for a fixed income person. I have mental stress over this problem and will never use Turbotax again! They cannot be trusted. They also stated somewhere on their writings that they would pay the penalties and interest. With the number of respondents to 2008, I doubt it!
I filed 2008 taxes for my friend using Turbo Tax. He received a 1099-R with a partial non-taxable rollover and received the difference which was taxable. I entered the information exactly the way it was on the 1099 and how the Turbo Tax asked for it. The program did not report the taxable portion. After several emails, the representative tells me that I should have entered the whole amount as taxable. I know for certain that it is not correct. He refuses to give me a telephone call or a number to call to straighten this out. IRS has penalized my friend as committing a gross mistake, charged him interest and penalties as well as the additional tax for a total of $7,526. I have used Turbo Tax and Intuit products for several years. I researched the law and know I am correct. I have checked and rechecked my entries and they are all correct. What can we do? How do we get a class action suit? Surely, there should be some remedy. I did find a telephone number for Intuit and I will call it and report back to you what I will find.
My situation is very similar to Eddie of Fairlee, VT. I used TurboTax to file my 2008 return. Apparently, my retirement income was computed as non-taxable. I will be more than willing to write a statement to support any class action suit. I received notice from the IRS that I owe $4,000 on the unreported income.
Turbo Tax did not include the 10% penalty on a 401k withdrawal for my 2008 taxes. There was nothing on line 16/16a for it. I got a letter yesterday from the IRS saying I owe over $3000 plus penalties!
My complaint is the same as Sara from Des Moines, IA. Turbo Tax did not tax retirement income. The IRS now wants unpaid taxes, penalties and fees from me. It was nearly impossible to find a Turbo Tax employee who speaks understandable English. No one there could answer any questions that I asked so the answer was to transfer my call to someone else. Like Sara, I am disgusted with Turbo Tax. I will never use them again and I complained to my bank for endorsing their services.
I have been using TurboTax for several years to file my parent's tax return. For the tax year 2008, TurboTax took the retirement income my father had been claiming for the past five years and made it non-taxable. It has been the same amount from the same trustee forever. I did not notice that the software changed the taxable consequence. I put in the correct information and did all of the required double checks. I did not realize that there was a problem until my father got a huge tax due notice from the IRS. My father is being charged $7,800 by the IRS for failure to report. I look at all of the other years' tax returns and the amount in question is in the proper column. In 2008 it is in the wrong column. It was input by me correctly. The software even knows what it should be asking for. The amount does not change. The result is my father is going to have a heart attack if this is not resolved. He does not cheat and has never in his 78 years had a problem with taxes, until TurboTax.
I used this product to file my 2009 taxes. I paid for the item online and completed the forms. It was to be emailed on March 10, 2010 with a refund expected and paid directly to my bank account. Recently, I have been told by IRS that my taxes were not filed with them. I can't contact anyone at Turbo Tax, get a direct email address or a telephone number. My sign in information, even after being verified by an email from Turbo Tax without the ability for me to respond to the email site, is not being accepted by Turbo as accurate. I have used Turbo Tax since 2005, but will never use them again. I have never heard of a company that will not publish a customer service contact other than "Talk to Tina", which is the most inane vehicle to receive any information. This stressful situation has made me physically ill and I was diagnosed with having a mild stroke and have contracted Bells Palsy, which can be verified by my doctors. Stress, stress and more stress caused by Turbo Tax. I must reconstruct my 2009 taxes from my copy from Turbo Tax with "Do Not File" printed on each page. There should be some effort on the part of Turbo Tax to respond to my inquiries. I will be expected to pay late fees by IRS even though they say they experience this quite often with Turbo Tax and I should expect some cooperation from them. I have sent "Do not use this product" to all of my email addresses and have received responses of similar problems with this company. Physically, I am too ill to stay on my computer for hours and hours trying to find contact for customer service. There seems to me to be a class action suit possibilities with this company after hearing many of the complaints documented against them.
You e-filed my 2009 return on March 10, 2010 but IRS has no record of receiving it. I am furious that one cannot contact you directly and not one Turbo Tax website gives you a number to call. I want you to re-file it immediately and send me a response in writing or email that you have done so. I have bought and used Turbo Tax for five years. My daughter also filed her 2009 return with you on April 16, 2010 and IRS has no record of receiving it. Both reflect refunds. She will file her complaint separately. After being on the telephone for hours insisting the return had been filed timely, it has caused me great stress. During this recent process I was diagnosed with having a mild stroke and subsequently contracted Bell’s palsy. I would appreciate you addressing this matter immediately.
I do not have an address for TurboTax. We filed our 2008 and 2009 state and federal taxes by TurboTax. They took our bank account # and routing # and sent us an e-notification that our 2008 taxes had been filed and paid. In my ignorance, I didn't realize TurboTax does not pay the taxes due, the taxpayer must do that. In 2010, I again filed our 2009 taxes by TurboTax and IRS rejected our return because we did not file in 2008. It was then that I found out what was happening. Thank God there isn't a lot of money involved, but we still have to pay fines and penalties. We had a small return this year, but will lose it to fines and penalties.
TurboTax 2008 did not tell me that we cannot take the Hope credit because it was taken in 2006 and 2007 and encouraged to take it instead that it was done after 243 combinations to give the biggest tax break. It asked the question whether the child was in the first or second year of college, obviously there are 2 semesters, so the child is in 2nd year for one of those, and you tend to click yes. I think TurboTax should be liable for this (or at least part of it) because of the inaccuracy of the way it was set up. I have a feeling that they will avoid responsibility. I hate to go back and pay over $1700 two years later to the IRS. It is not fair to look for the money to repay, you rely on a software to provide accurate information so that you do the taxes as honestly as possible.
I just received a letter from the IRS. It seems that the 2008 version of Turbo Tax did not identify that I had already claimed the HOPE educational credit for my daughter in 2006 and 2007. I imported my files, so I am not sure why it suggested to take the credit. I now have to pay back over $1000.00 two years later. I have suffered economic hardship due to the tax software glitch.
I used TurboTax online and paid $757 in taxes. Then just the other day, I got another bill from IRS, telling me I owe an additional $250 in taxes because of these people’s program errors in calculating my taxes. I complained to them, but they said they only pay penalties and interests, not for their mistakes. This has put financial hardship to my budget and has put me in back rent payments and other bills.
We just learned that we owe $15,000 plus penalties on our 2007 taxes based on the fact that the TurboTax software claimed several itemized deductions twice. If anyone out there is organizing a class action lawsuit against TurboTax, count us in! We owe $15,000 plus another $3000 in penalties plus interest.
I filed our 2009 Income Taxes (State and Federal) through TurboTax online program on February 21st, 2010. Our taxes were accepted through TurboTax program by the Federal and the State Government of North Carolina on February 21st also. We paid our preparation fees up front and paid to receive a Rapid Refund, which would allow us to receive our refunds via direct deposit into our Bank of America joint checking account via the location at Waterside Crossing, in Denver, NC on February 5th, 2010. I checked our account balance on the 5th and was surprised to find that no federal refund via Turbo Tax had been made. I waited 10 consecutive days (checking our account at least twice a day) looking for our federal refund to no avail. I contacted the IRS and they said that our refund had been processed and paid out to us via TurboTax, performed an investigation and mailed us a report that they did exactly as they should have, and that our money was sent to TurboTax to be deposited into our BOA account and closed their case. I contacted TurboTax, their location in California that issues the refunds to the bank accounts (or prepaid debit card accounts) and was able to find out that someone has went into the secure website at TurboTax and stole my husband's (primary) and my identities, used my husband's information alone and was able to set up a prepaid "Account Now" debit card account with our Joint Federal Income Tax Refund of $7400. Interestingly enough, the bank that issues refunds to banks and these prepaid debit card accounts and the point of origin are the same small town in California. Our refund was loaded to an Account Now prepaid debit card and mailed to a physical home address in West Charlotte, NC, received on February 5th, 2010 and spent leaving an account balance of -$13 within a 10 day period of time. A Lincoln County detective (we live in Lincoln County, NC) visited the home that the prepaid debit card was delivered to and said that the women living there is 96 years old and is not the 36 year old described as the owner of this home where our refund was sent to. The detective is currently waiting response back from a court ordered request from Intuit (TurboTax). They have until June 30th to respond, regarding information on this case. After reporting to TurboTax what had happened to us, the Secretary of the President of Intuit, stopped all information from being obtained regarding this case from anyone, including any portion of the police community, unless they are subpoenaed or warranted to by a court or judge. I have worked on this fiasco to the best of my abilities. I have had two open heart surgeries. The last one last December. We are just average people that have always worked for everything that we have. I am on permanent disability due to my health at age 46. We have our third child still in college and desperately need our Federal Tax Refund back ASAP! This has been a nightmare, with no end in sight. Our economic damage is not being able to bring our house payments up to date (we are two payments behind) as well as other outstanding medical and credit card bills that we will use this refund for. The amount of stress that my husband are under is incredible! I have had periods where I have not slept for days over this. We are unable to help our son with his college expenses this year until we receive our refund. Please help us!
I sent the follow letter to TurboTax which explains my problem. I received an email, Thursday, June 10, 2010 8:18 PM, from Bob **, TurboTax, Vice President. The subject of the email is "Critical Notice Regarding your TurboTax Return". He explained that I may have claimed a deduction twice when preparing my 2007, 2008 or 2009 tax return. It so happen that this situation did apply to me. TurboTax Software did not adequately cover and was misleading in how to consider Medical Insurance Premium Deductions for the years 2007 and 2008. This was cleared up in the year 2009. In 2009, you did add the statement above the Medical Insurance Premium Deduction which states "Don't include self employment health insurance Medicare premiums or health insurance payments paid through your government annuity. TurboTax automatically includes payments in the Wages and Income Section". I commend you for adding this statement since it clarifies a confusing issue that was not clear in prior years of TurboTax. I am vitally concerned about the tax liability (including interest) that I am now faced with because the issue was not explained in the year 2007 (as well as 2008). Your instructions specifically states in your TurboTax 2007, Medical Insurance Premiums portion that Insurance Premiums that one pays for Medical Care could be included as a deduction. It further states "Amounts withheld from your paycheck by your employer my not be deducted unless they are included in Box 1 of the Forms W-2" (in my case it would be a 1099). The premiums I paid for medical insurance was in fact included in Block 1. The TurboTax software says nothing about the program automatically including the insurance premiums. You are supposed to be the tax professionals and I took you at your word. I am not a tax preparer expert that is the reason I purchased TurboTax. I think that TurboTax knew that this was misleading since they clarified the situation in TurboTax 2009. Because of the problem explained above in your software I am now faced with at least a $1071 tax liability and possibly more after interest for late payment is considered. I believe that TurboTax should have some if not all the liability in this situation. I am very perturbed over this situation to say the least. People depend on your software to be correct and not misleading. I'm not sure but a class action lawsuit may be appropriate in this situation. I would like your comments and what you plan to do to rectify problems with me and other people in the same situation. By the way the web address included in Mr. **. EMail for your Satisfaction Guarantee is not a valid address.
Turbo Tax did not report retirement income, even though I entered the information, and I now owe over $3,000 in back taxes for 2008. On form 1040A, line 16A is not carried forward to line 16B, which should have been the total amount, because my whole annuity is taxable, because I was retired before retirement age. All of these errors resulted in my receiving a large refund, that I should have not received. I should have gotten about half that much. I received a notice from the IRS that I owe $3,646 in back taxes, plus interest. I know these are Turbo Tax's errors that caused this, and they should have to pay the tax, plus interest, due to their program being defective. They do not show retirement income as being taxable, hence, miscalculations on that page. When my info transfers to do 2009 return, it shows that I entered the info. I have also tried to print the screen that shows I entered the info last year, and it just prints blank pages. Having to pay this back has resulted in my not getting a tax return this year. I am not sure how to file my 2009 return, because I do not have the 2008 done correctly, just the IRS saying they fixed it, so I have filed an extension for 2009, and I cannot complete my state either, because I don't know how to do it, now that last year's info was completely wrong, and because I owe the IRS money, I cannot afford to pay a tax professional. So, I am stuck in a bad financial situation, and have no idea how to proceed, except continue to make payments to the IRS for a mistake Turbo Tax made, and I am on the verge of losing our home, because of owing IRS money. I would love to speak to someone about this.
I received a check from Intuit for $66 and called the number on the check. It was a Turbo Tax check and they stated that I have been over paid by the state due to their error. They insist that I cash the check; however, I believe that I will hold off because they were so insistent on my cashing it. The state overpaid me by $130.
I have written to this forum several times concerning TurboTax Online 2007 and 2008 making Retirement Income Non-taxable. I have filed a complaint in small claims court (date pending) and would like to get some written statements from others who have had the same issue. This will help me win my case against TurboTax and maybe open the door for others.
On form 1040A: Line 15 not carried forward to line 15 which should have been total income. Line 21 should have been adjusted gross income was left blank. Line 22 left blank which should have been same as line 21. Line 25 shows 0 which should have been line 24 subtracted from line 22. Line 27 left blank which should have been difference between lines 26 and 25. Nothing is shown on line 28 TAX. Nothing is shown on lines 29 through line 42 except for 38 that shows fed tax withheld. There is incorrect amount shown on lines 44 and 45a. All of these errors resulted in my receiving a large refund that I should have not received. I should have gotten about half that much. Now, I have a notice from IRS that I owe about $1900 in back taxes plus interest. No penalty as yet is shown. I am on RR retirement for disability and it's just a small amount. I believe these are TurboTax errors that caused this and they should have to pay the tax plus interest due to their program being defective. They do not show retirement income as being taxable, hence miscalculations on that page.
I received a notice from the IRS stating that I did not claim retirement income. I am certain this amount was entered into the software, but it is not showing on my form. I’m wondering if any other complaint with this and how I could get proof if the information was entered into the software.
I have used TurboTax for years and always save my TurboTax files on backup floppies and hard drives. I recently needed to recall my 2006 TurboTax data for use in an IRS audit and can't get 2006 TurboTax software to read the saved data file back into Turbo Tax. I can't find a support telephone number to call for help and info on their web site. It has not been helpful with this type of problem. Since I can't go back and see how TurboTax handled my tax return, I will be forced to refer to only the hard copy print which will most likely cost me about $5000.00 in back taxes.
In 2007, we filed my widowed mother's taxes using TurboTax. Her only income is from two small annuities and her Social Security. The return showed her with a refund. She received notice from the IRS that she in fact owned additional taxes for that year. Now, she has received a letter regarding the same problem with 2008. We notified TurboTax of the 2007 error but have never received a reply. The same error (not showing the retirement income as taxable) on subsequent years smacks as negligent on their part. Is anyone planning to sue?
I purchased this product, which is expensive, in order to be assured of no mistakes on my tax forms. I received a notice from the IRS that "the amount entered for the standard deduction was incorrect for the filing status claimed on my form". A very simple error! What is the point of buying this expensive software only to discover that it makes mistakes on my forms? There was no physical or economic damage as a result, but the amount of my refund was significantly less than TurboTax had figured. The manufacturers of this software are dishonest about what can be expected from their product. It needs to be taken off the market!
In 2007 and 2008, I used TurboTax online to do my taxes. I now owe the IRS and state over $14,000 in back taxes, interest and penalties because TurboTax put my retirement income on line 16a (non-taxable). I have filed a claim in small claims court against them and to save anyone who may want to do the same thing. The cost and hassle I went through here is the address you need to have the papers served to. It costs $75.00 to have the papers served. I owe the IRS over $14,000, suing them in small claims court.
I received a CP2000 from the IRS claiming that I over reported my Social security taxes. I filed my 2008 taxes using the TurboTax 2008 online software but the software added my social security taxes and my wife's as one and therefore taking my taxes over the Cap for SS and thus received a refund for the excess. In 2010, I received a CP2000 charging me for that refund. TurboTax has a guarantee with their software that if the cause of an audit was due to their calculation, it would be paid by them but I have not been able to get them to honor that guarantee. Now, I have a bill of $1900 due to the IRS. Now, I have a bill of $1900 due to the IRS.
Turbo Tax (TT) would not load. I called Intuit, spoke with someone who does not speak English, made more phone calls. Finally, I spoke with a technician, who advised me that their product sold at Costco had incorrect directions. If I would get on the internet, they could send me proper program. I paid to have internet installed in my home, program still will not run, but gives me a different error code now. Last year, I had to pay a computer specialist to load the program for me because of programming errors. I was audited for two years ago. TT put income in the wrong place and I was charged interest, late fees and penalties for sloppy work. Over the last 20 years, I have purchased five copies of statistical program for the social science (SPSS) and it loads perfectly on different machines with different programs. I have purchased many other programs and they all work perfectly, except for TT which should be using the same base year after year.
I paid for you Turbo Tax to handle my tax return. I am boiling mad that I paid for a service and I still have no refund. Reply to me when I hired you do my taxes, (the date) and after you give me that information take a look at what I paid to efile my return and tell me if I deserve some kind of refund since my return has not been paid to date 5/7/2010. If you need to stop payment to have my tax return to go to my bank, I will provide that information. This Turbo Tax card has a debt of .50 cents and I believe it was for an card balance. Why am I being charged to check my balance since this is the only way I can check to see if my tax return was loaded into my card.
I used TurboTax. Now, NJ is saying I did not pay the right amount in 2006 so I have a penalty and interest. TurboTax did not register my husband's retirement annuity as income.
For several years in a row, TurboTax did not include my DOD disability retirement as taxable income. During the process, I answered the question, "Did you retire before reaching legal retirement age" (that is close to how it was worded), and whenever I answered yes to this question, my refund amount would skyrocket. The program was claiming my $18,000 to $20,000 per year disability annuity as non-taxable income! Since no federal taxes were ever deducted from this annuity (by DOD), I did not realize there was an error. I input my DOD annuity information correctly but the program did not recognize this income as taxable! This year the error has been fixed and the new TurboTax program, including a statement saying that most Federal disability annuities are taxable. This is new and probably came as a result of my numerous complaint letters to them. They have never once responded to me. I am stuck with a total of approximately $6,000.00 in back taxes due and no way to ever pay it! The penalties just keep building and the IRS's threatening letters get worse and worse. I live on a fixed disability income after being injured in the line of duty in the AF and there is no way to pay for this debt. I am probably going to suffer heart trouble over it.
In 2008 TurboTax did not include some retirement income, excluding it online 16a. I had to pay a penalty. The same thing happened in 2009. TurboTax has lost me.
I used Turbo Tax to prepare my 2009 federal and state returns. When completed the 1040 showed no federal tax due. Two months after filing the return, I received a bill from the IRS for several hundred dollars plus interest. Turbo Tax also failed to provide the proper form for sending payment to accompany my WV tax return. By chance before mailing I read the instructions WV sent me. I have contacted Turbo Tax Customer Service, but they have not replied.
I used TurboTax 2009 to file my federal taxes. Because I recently received an IRS audit letter and demand to pay additional taxes for a TurboTax error on my 2008 taxes, I looked over my just filed 2009 tax documents as well and found that TurboTax 2009 again failed to show my federal retirement annuity on line 16a and instead reported it as wages on line 7. Although the program asked for and I correctly entered my retirement annuity data to the Worksheet, the program failed to place the amount on line 16a and instead placed it on line 7 which will result in the IRS auditing my 2009 taxes and I anticipate receiving another audit letter soon. TurboTax has lost me forever as a customer!
The 2009 tax return that was electronically filed for me by TurboTax was not the same as the return that the application presented to me in PDF just before filing. TurboTax changed various items in my Itemized Deductions, reverting to erroneous entries that I had corrected. At a minimum, I will have to file an amended return. Since the return filed by TurboTax showed a lower balance due than I actually owed (because the application put in erroneous deductions), I may be subject to interest and/or penalty charges.
Just got a letter from the IRS, seems 2008 Turbo Tax deducted our IRA contributions even though we exceeded the AGI allowed for deductions. I checked 2009 Turbo Tax and it did the same. I'm having to send a check for underpayment of 2008 taxes and will have to file an amended return for 2009. I've never had to do that before. I've used Turbo Tax for over 10 years but the last 2 years were awful, I will be changing tax software for 2010. owe the taxes - okay. But also have to pay interest and spend time figuring out what was done wrong and spend time filling an amended return for 2009.
I have used the online service for years this past year. As always, it dumped the data from my Federal into the State of WI and said I had a return of $200.00 and let me e-file on 2/1/10. On 3/26/10, I received a letter from the State of WI telling me I owed $253.00 because the Taxable IRA amount was calculated wrong. I reviewed the form I printed when filed as well as the copy I saved, and they do not match the state's required form. I went online to review my return, only to see it had been revised by Turbo Tax without any notification to me. This is a disgrace not only to me but to then hear that this has happened to my ex-wife as well. We have the same issue, same problem. How many others were swindled? I paid their fee and trusted in their services, only to get a refund and spend it on paying bills; and now, I have to pay that back plus some. I would like a refund and compensation for the grief as well as the added time put into to resolve this situation. I will never use this software again and will definitely warn friends and family.
I have used Turbo Tax for years. The 2009 Edition was not what I have become accustom to. I have sought out an avenue to advise anyone who has used Turbo Tax to review their return very carefully. Although Turbo Tax allowed me to file with the correct filing status, it did not allow for the correct exemptions in my return no matter how many times I tried to correct the error. The program did not allow for the correction even for me to amend my return. I had no success with the customer service. They insisted I needed to amend my return due to a higher education credit, when it was really because the program did not allow for the exemption of my son who is a full-time college student. Due to this error, I had a higher tax and I did not receive the correct refund.
The online version of product did not work as advertised. Desktop version (which I used last year) successfully imported trading data from Fidelity account. Online version did not! After several hours of repeatedly foiling the programs prompts to fix data I had already added, I discovered it was now duplicated or worse. I also found a view that show the data had in fact been imported to TT, but TT failed to recognize it. Online version does not work as advertised. Even worse. Their errors prevented me from taking advantage of their much-vaunted "online filing." Oh yeah, and they charged me 2x for the online version... another battle to look forward to! I am going back to paper and pencil or my $500 accountant. Consequences included double billing (an extra $89), 12-16 hours of wasted time and frustration, potential errors in state and federal filings, and potential overpayment of taxes.
This is the exact same complaint as "Steve of Alpharetta, GA on April 16, 2010". Turbo Tax 2009 doubled my W-2 income on the step prior to final transmission. (I hit the "transmit" icon, the software asked for my W-2 info on a "for my use only" form and then only gave me a "transmit" choice when I completed the data entry). The transmitted Federal 1040 and the MA State Tax form both had the doubled W-2 information on them. My MA state tax went from $156 due to $1,353. My Federal tax due went from $1,443 to $33,000+. There is "no stopping the train" once you hit the "transmit" icon! I have already spent two days trying to amend my tax returns with the Federal IRS, MA IRS, and my bank. I was only expecting a $156 to be withdrawn from bank account. The state of MA took $1,353 out of account ($1,197 too much!). The Federal IRS tried to take out $33,000+ but I was able to block that transfer (a $29 bank fee). Thanks to a kind bank employee, my bank account is not overdrawn. It should have been! I have sent in all the paperwork for an amended MA State Tax form. Hopefully that problem is resolved and my extra funds will be returned. The Federal IRS representative told me to call back around May 1st, 2010 to check on the status of my tax form. I have mailed in a check for the balance due of $1,443. Who knows what penalties await?
I filed 2008 Federal Taxes using Turbo Tax. The program did not add my 1099 R form as Military Retirement pay (after serving 23 years in the military I get my retirement pay every month). They added it as something else. Your company should check Turbo Tax. It is costing the consumer a lot of money on interests and fees and the IRS do not care who made the mistake and the consumer gets stuck with all the fees. It is not fair for the consumers.
Same thing happened to me as in previous complaints. I finished my 2009 taxes and started the e-file process to the federal government and state government. During the e-file process, a form came up and asked me to fill in box 1 for my my wife's unemployment compensation. It did not say why it wanted this information. I tried to continue but could not so I put in my wife's unemployment benefits again. I was then able to continue. This took me to the final e-file box to which I hit continue. Right after that, I looked at the top of the screen and noticed it took the box 1 value and added to my already completed taxes. Now instead of getting refund, I owe federal taxes.
I paid $50 for a copy of 2009 Turbotax at Costco and used it to e-file my Federal and CO state return. They charged me $20 to e-file my state return even though the state never charged me anything when I have e-filed in the past using the state website. They also required me to mail the state a paper copy which was not required in the past. The whole process took me twice as long as doing my taxes myself even though I am very computer and internet literate. The only economic damage and extra $70 expense and about two extra days of my time.
I finished my 2009 taxes and started the E-File process to the Federal Govt. During the E-File Process a form came up and asked me to fill in Box 1 for my Employer W2. It did not say why it wanted this information. I tried to continue but could not so I put in my income for the employer thinking it wanted to send in a mock W-2. I was then able to continue. This took me to the final E-File box to which I hit continue. Right after that I looked at the top of the screen and noticed it took the Box 1 value and added to my already completed taxes. Now my tax bill is 10X the amount which will drain my bank account.
I have used this product for years but the 2009 version was particularly disappointing. I had a business to report and it was extremely cumbersome to make changes to the data entry. To make a change to business expenses already entered, the program led me back through 30 plus screens to reach the business expense screen so the change could be made. On one screen I answered the question regarding the use of a home office as no but the program continued through 10 additional screens before the home office could be deleted. There were many more examples regarding the tedious process of correcting entries.
While submitting my 2009 State and Federal Taxes, I came across what I feel is a very deceptive "offer". In order to file my State tax, I must pay an additional fee of $19.95 (okay, no real problem here). However, in doing so the software has teamed up with a company called "MetaBank" who then offers you the "convenience" of having your state filing fee of $19.95 deducted directly from your return. After going through the mundane task of inputting all the tax data, I figure, why not? Go ahead, take the fee directly from my refund. What I was unaware of was that I would then be charged a "Meta Refund Processing Service Fee" of $29.95. So, I spent $29.95 to pay $19.95. Wow. Of course, Turbo Tax distances itself from this fraud by their disclaimer that you were given several opportunities to reject the "offer" and subsequent fee. What they are counting on is by the time you get to the end of this burdensome task of filing your taxes you have already had enough and just want to get it done. If you read the language of the "MetaBank Refund Processing Agreement" is is clear that they expect you to have buyers remorse once you realize you had already been taken. I filed a complain with the FTC and did some research on the offending partner in crime, MetaBank of South Dakota only to find that they have a total of 52 complaints processed through the BBB in the last 36 months. If you read the Turbo Tax community threads, you can see that a lot of people have been duped and are very unsatisfied. I am hopeful that enough people will be outraged and force a review of this deceptive practice. I further hope that some legal scholar will seize the opportunity to expose this fraud.
I tried to e-file with Turbo Tax. My wages were doubled. The IRS rejected my paperwork because according to them, Turbo Tax did not transmit my taxes for 2008. I am on hold at this moment, 12:55pm EST, for an hour now. Something should be done about them and I hope, I do not have to pay a penalty for 2008 and 2009 taxes.
I have used TT for several years without problems. This year was totally different. I submitted the completed taxed on-line and both State and Federal were rejected due to an "Error with Schedule M". I followed TT directions for correcting the problem. I called the IRS/SS to verify payment re-submitted and was rejected again. I followed their directions again and was rejected two more times for a total of four times (the last time it took almost 12 hours to get the notice of rejection). I bought this software to make filing easier and ended up filing by mail. After the cost to file the State (and have it be rejected) and paying for the program initially. I could have spent the same amount and had a tax professional take care of my taxes. And they would have been able to e-file to get my refund faster. I am totally disgusted with Turbo Tax 2009 Version.
Turbo Tax intentionally misleads the customer in every way possible. Nothing is free, and hidden charges are everywhere. They have become a very shady company.
Well, as others have said, I've been a loyal Turbo Tax user for well over 5 years despite my slight disdain for Intuit's price gouging history. They started with "sunsetting" their Quicken product every 3 years after the date of your purchased version. From many accounts, it seems they are continuing the tradition with Turbo Tax. I never write these blog review complaints, who has the time? And to some extent, the verdict is still out on this year's version of Intuit's Turbo Tax 2009. For me, however, it appears that they best get their act together and none too soon. The problem is they are a big fish and it is easy to get "hooked" on their products as have I and so many others. So let me get down to "brass tacks" regarding my immediate beef. Getting to the points. So I suppose I am to "blame" because I procrastinate and do none too well with deadlines. So 11:15 hits and I say to myself I better file an extension because it seems there is no way I'll be done by 12 midnight on April 15. So as I know I did several years ago with Turbo Tax, I decided to search in my $100 program for how I may file an extension. It seems easy enough and of course, I have plenty of time to do so. First, I figured it should be easily identified by some blatant button but to no avail. So I checked "File", nope not there. Anywhere else on the menu? Nope. How about under "e-file"?. Nope. Is there a table of contents? Nope. How about under "forms"? Nope. So maybe I'll check "Help". I couldn't find it there but help is so cumbersome anyway and by now, I'm running low on time. Hey, I know. I'll type "file extension" in the search field. No matches, however, there is now a fire burning in my temples at this point. My BP now 1000 over 1. Hey I know, I'll Google "Turbo Tax file extension". Hmmm, eureka or so I thought. I'm given the impression that they are going to help me out here and time is now precious and I'm about to turn into a pumpkin. So I went through their multiple "easy extension" screens, confirmed and reconfirmed and researched some obscure 2008 figure and entered it. Now, I'm faced with a "checkout cart" and a request for a $50 service fee and I haven't even begun to tackle the state extension and there seems little promise of finding such a service with Turbo Tax. Had they provided such a service, perhaps they would plan to gouge me for another $50. This for a 2-minute, one page extension filing. They're in hopes that I will desperately bite having gone through their maze and being out of time and having arrived at the prospect of paying an additional $50 over and above the $100 I've spent on my edition of TT.. Perhaps, I would not have been charged money had I found the possibility of an extension on my version. I don't know. Perhaps yes, perhaps no but who could find it? I don't believe they charge for this in the past. So I now have 3 minutes left and I closed their $50 offer window and googled "income tax extension". Thank God someone complained about Turbo Tax and suggested TaxAct as a quick and free solution to filing an extension. I didn't even have to go to the article. I read it on google itself. My hero, mind you, 12 midnight has struck at this point but I forge on determined. A couple of extra but easy screens later, my extension was relatively effortlessly filed by 12:05 minutes after discovering TaxAct (If the IRS will now accept my extension and not consider it past the deadline, I'll be lucky). Are the people at Turbo Tax ** in a poor work environment or are they a bunch of money grubbing ** looking to squeeze every last cent out of their victims? Certainly not considered customers from what I can gather. You know, Charles Schwab gave up the reigns for only a short while only to return because the new order was quickly running the company into the ground with excessive fees. He's returned because of their incompetence and now has to spend 5 years to rebuild the brand and prior positive impression of the company that once existed. I'm a fool and will probably buy Turbo Tax again next year because I suck at "change" but I'm not at all impressed. Quite the contrary. Who are these people? Does anyone know? Any insights?
I've used Turbo Tax for years! There's definitely been a change for the much worse! I bought the state partnership return online through the business TT program and there was no link to download. I had to wait until the next day when their call center was open to have them push a link into my online account. However, once I downloaded and installed it, the forms never appeared in the TT program. It still wanted me to pay for and download them. I called TT, explained the problem and was asked to uninstall then reinstall. Same thing happened, no forms in TT program. That's when the "support" person hung up on me. I called right back. I have to admit that at least, the new guy tried. However, he couldn't understand me, sent me on wild goose chases, had me look for and do things completely unrelated. The people you talk to for support have obviously never used the program before because they can't follow a conversation in which you say "the state tab still shows I need to download", "you know, after you input the federal information then move on to the state", no concept of what I was talking about. Have they seen the TT program before? Hey TT, newsflash. You should teach the support personnel what's in the program before you let them loose. 30 minutes later, I got nowhere and got a refund. Never again Turbo Tax. You are now moved to the unreliable column. Today's tax day. I ended up paying $$$$ for a professional to file my business and personal taxes. I've learned my lesson Turbo Tax.
I bought the CD and installed the program. I filled in the questions and e-filed my federal taxes. I qualified for a free e-file for my state taxes. The program wouldn't let me do it without paying $44. The link to TurboTax wanted me to input the Federal info again. I contacted the company via chat. Long time explaining over and over again, my problem wasn’t resolved which caused tears due to frustration. And the solution?! Input info again. Library closed. I started again this morning by inputting info online for Federal. Completed it and started State. I e-filed State after a few moans and groans. I went through the two federal returns; two different outcomes! I’m waiting for chat to start so I can get help! I can see the line item discrepancy but I can't change it in the interview process! For a firm that has been around for such a long time, I'm disgusted that you have this frustration and I still don't know what's going to happen! Two federal returns and I don't know how this affects my state return! Sheri N contacted me at 6:02 pm CST. Thirty plus minutes later and six different ways from Sunday, I have to file an amended return and redo that as well as my property tax myself! "You can use TurboTax to do it." Really?! I can’t find the discrepancy! Next year, $200 is worth more than my two days of tears and frustration and I still have to file the amendment and redo my property tax! Thanks for the heartache TurboTax.
I am so frustrated with Turbo Tax. First, my extension was rejected by the IRS because apparently you can not include both your pin and your 2008 AGI. However, on Turbo Tax you have to complete both boxes. Then I decided to just e-file my taxes and again it was rejected by the IRS for the same reason and again Turbo Tax did not allow me to submit with only the pin or 2008 AGI. Now, I have printed out the return and am filing by mail. Never again will I use Turbo Tax. I have paid Turbo Tax for both the return and the extension and am out that money because I basically filed the return myself.
I have a dial-up computer connection so could not download the update to the Turbo Tax Deluxe forms. I called them and they said they would mail me a CD with the update. I got an update download from a friend who has a cable computer connection and was able to finish my federal taxes. I then tried to get my North Carolina tax form but Turbo Tax said that there was a program glitch and then would "hang" my computer. I used their on line interface and was told that they would send me a CD of my state tax forms. I finally gave up waiting and did a manual workout of my state taxes. Now it is April 15 and I still have not received either CD from Turbo Tax.

I am done with Turbo Tax after 5 years of faithful use. This has been the worst year for ease of use. In prior years the topics I looked up would open to the windows in the forms where the data went. This year it would go to TT info page. After spending a day entering all of my info I went to efile. $20 seemed steep to file a state return but if figured I'd be done. When I entered my financial info there was an additional $49.95 added as a processing fee. I thought that was excessive and backed up in the program. All of my data was erased. I called Intuit and Jason, a customer service supervisor, couldn't help me because I was 2 days past the 60-day warranty. He was very rude. When I asked what office he was in and told him I was going to complain to corporate, he hung up on me. The home and business software has become too expensive. Turbo Tax makes a big deal about the free efile for the federal return. They fail to mention the bend over for the state return. I need to spend another day entering in my info. Turbo Tax should include the additional fees for the service they charge on the box of the product.
I have used Turbo Tax for about 10 years. This year I paid $100 for the Home & Business edition but can't install it on my computer because of the net issue. I tried for over 4 hours to install the program. I can't find a phone number on the program so that I can call.
I was filing my income tax with TurboTax with software sent over the web to me. My tax return never went to IRS for reason unknown to me. I have asked for assistance from the company through the internet, without results. TurboTax charged me $54.00 for the service and made no effort to help me with my problem. Finally, I had to go to H&R Block to handle my return, at the tune of $78.00. I am very disgusted with TurboTax for taking my money and giving nothing in return. Consequently, I will never use them or recommend that company to anyone.
It is two days before taxes are due (April 13) but the Turbotax software message states that my electronic return can't be filed because a Form 1040 and Schedule A for itemized deductions are not "Available". Many hours were spent submitting the information lost. I have to go online to download forms from IRS and upload with another paid service.
I've used Turbo Tax for the last 6 or 7 years with no major problems. I was ready to e-file my 2009, when Turbo Tax ask me to fill in box 1 with my wife's wages. I filled in the information and to my surprise, the software doubled my wife's income. I tried to hit the cancel button on the screen, but the 1040 was filed it wouldn't cancel. I tried for 3 hours to reach intuits customer, no service, finally had to send an e-mail then get a code to talk to a real person, whom said the only thing I could do is file an amendment after my e-file was accepted and go to the bank and put a stop pay on the automatic deduction. Needless to say, Turbo Tax is not in my tax future anymore because of this software malfunction. I went from owing $500 to feds to $16,000 and instead of a refund from GA of $400. Now, they think I owe $3,000, I pray I can amend my returns with out a fight! I'll not ever recommend or use this software again!
Unable to download tax return or to save a copy for my records. I entered all the data to send my return to the IRS and it was never sent via TurboTax. I can not print a copy for my records because it is holding me up for more money. The consequences are that I can not file my return.
Received letter from IRS stating our taxes for 2008 were incorrect and we now owe 4,800. Cause turbo tax didn't carry a zero, which by looking at it appears to be what happened. I feel they should be liable for the fees and or interest the IRS feels we owe, of course as for the taxes we realize we owe them. Seriously, if the IRS wants electronic filing should they and the suppliers of software make sure it all is current and functional how could it not happen to everyone else that pulled money from a 401k. We were penalized and taxed then and to pile on more cause software malfunctioned or wasn't up to date? Use through State Farm sure that doesn't help their image either. So it fails twice cause the checkup noticed nothing wrong either. Ugh could have spent that money on car to get it running.
I have used Turbo Tax each year since 1999 with satisfaction until this year which has been extremely frustrating. I started entering data 11 March and after about 20 minutes I was informed that Form 1040, Sch A & Sch B was not available and that I would be notified by email when available. On 18 March, received notification that forms were available. On 20 March, I tried to obtain forms and were told they were not available. On 22 March, received email that they were available. On 27 March, I reconnected and completed both Fed and PA State returns. Upon examining the Fed return I found that Turbo Tax had under reported my Charity deduction by $95. On the state return, they showed pension income as taxable and it is not taxable in PA. By fudging some of the data I managed to correct this error. Neither the Turbo Tax package or disc contains an email or postal address or telephone number where the user can lodge a complaint. The package states that "Accurate Calculations are Guaranteed", but there is no way to contact them for correction. Next year, I will look for a more reliable supplier.
The program ask you to set up an account (user I.D and password) when you try to access your information. I'm not able to log in program, tells me that user I.D/password are incorrect, user I.D is my email and password is my son's name, it then tells me to reset password and it still does not let me access my account. This program is very frustrating. Gov. rejected my eFile and they tell you that they will not charge you again, but at the end of the transaction they charge you again. eFile has been rejected twice, not able to access account trying to log in several times without success, no one to be able to communicate with in order to fix the problem, very frustrating and depressing.
I have used TurboTax for several years and have been satisfied. So far, I have been unable to download my deluxe 2009 TurboTax. I searched for a phone number or a website on the package for assistance but found nothing. I located this site when I did a web search for TurboTax. My experience is not unusual, apparently. I will have to complete my taxes by hand. I anticipated difficulty in completing everything before the April 15th deadline even taking into account my return should be less complex this year. I expected difficulty in ascertaining values of donated items and anticipate my estimates will be undervalued. Damages? I cannot identify damages as of this moment but expect additional time necessary to do all by hand will be significant. Frustration (and anger) caused by failure of 2009 Turbo Tax will be significant.
I tried to upgrade the TurboTax and get help with taxes and I waited for about two hours for no help after upgrading for help.
Three days, 40 hours, 20 of which were on phone with Turbotax resulted in "Sorry, I will refund your purchase price." Still no refund on credit card. Issue is with failure to install .NET 3.5 SP1. All tools with Microsoft/TurboTax/etc have said all my .NET files are correct. I have deleted them, reinstalled them, deleted them, reverse reinstalled them/deleted them/rebooted after each reinstall/etc. TurboTax should be required to refund all purchasers who cannot get the software to install and be required to pay all interest for any late fees assessed by the IRS since we relied on Intuit and they screwed up! Lost time and frustration! Will now be late filing with IRS.
TurboTax incorrectly calculated the amount of tax owed on 5 out of 7 personal tax returns I completed using this product. The income tax returns have already been filed with the IRS, so amended returns had to be prepared and sent.
TurboTax has totally let me down. At the error check stage I am getting error code 20900072586 and TurboTax just freezes or crashes. Called TurboTax three times today, and they finally stated they have no fix for this, and no plan to fix it, and no viable work-around, so basically go away and work something out myself! TurboTax does not retain open problem tickets so every time I called I had to re-explain the issue, time consuming and frustrating, not state of the industry customer support. My computer and system are above the TT specified requirements, and my numbers of transactions are within the specified limits for the TT downloaded Home and Business program. Now I have to rush around and find a tax preparer at additional expense at the last minute. I would love to stay with TurboTax but need to look for alternatives in future since it is obvious that TT does not thoroughly test and support their product.
This is a warning only if you use TurboTax or know someone who does. Since 2006, we've been successfully using TurboTax to file our complex income taxes (with 2 or 3 small businesses). I am writing to warn you that today, I just lost 4 long days of 2009 tax data I'd entered while I was on the phone with a TurboTax staff person who was guiding me through on "Live Look", where she can see my desktop and every icon on it and the movements of my cursor. The reason that I called her is that the total of our charitable donations did not match the total in the summary--off by thousands of dollars, and I couldn't find the cause of the difference. In the midst of this conversation, TurboTax froze, crashed, wiping out all my work. I showed the gal (since she could view our desktop on her computer via LiveLook). How I could still open and close any other icon on my desktop when she said it was the fault of my computer, proving that it was Turbo, not my computer that crashed. She told me to close Turbo and put it in the trash, and empty the trash. I asked if she had a back-up copy of our 2009 tax file that she could send to me, since I was nearly done with it, and she assured me she did and not to worry about losing our copy here. She was dead wrong, and we're back to zero. I bawled. This gal's supervisor wasn't helpful either, and both gals admitted that there have been a lot of crashes and people losing data this year on Turbo, worse than in previous years, and that "their software staff is working on it." It is small consolation that we can take this disc back to Costco for a refund. I wish I could sue. We now have to go back to forking out big dough for a CPA. I have read on others' reviews that they couldn't connect their federal returns to their state returns. Be careful, and follow the supervisor's advice if you do use Turbo--save your data on a disc often, and if you have to rely entirely on that, you obviously couldn't email your federal return. We lost our entire Schedule C's for two business and all our Sch. An itemized deductions, etc., 4 days of data entry. I asked the supervisor to be reimbursed for 4 days of full time work at my usual self-paid rate, but she just said to take our TurboTax disc back to Costco for a refund, which we did. My nerves were shattered for several days, and I feel as if I can't trust a product that worked perfectly for us for the three previous years.
I used TurboTax online to electronically file my 2008 Fed. Return. I was recently notified by the IRS that they never received my return. Now, to my astonishment, I have no way of contacting TurboTax, every contact option for them on their website is not available unless you decide that you want to purchase again this year. I don't think so! I just want to be able to contact someone from their office to tell them very rudely how they have screwed up my life. Gee, I can't get my $1500 refund for my 2009 tax return now until I refile my 2008 tax return. My 2008 refund was so meager, I never even noticed that I didnt get it back.
I have used Intuit's TurboTax Deluxe for many years. Each year the product got better, except for this year. My wife and I file married jointly. The software calculated our total tax due incorrectly for the Federal. The software calculated total tax due as $19,090 on taxable income of $107,854. The total tax due should be $19,338. I calculated the correct value by hand, using the IRS' 1040 tax tables. If I had not found this understatement of Federal taxes due, I would be facing future IRS penalties. I will never use TurboTax Deluxe again. If the company cannot do this simple calculation, how can one trust its merit on more complicated calculations? Just a question!
Turbo Tax 2009 Premier Disk would not install. The reason it gave was that my computer required NET 3.5 Service Pack 1 Framework from Microsoft. The disk guided me through what was to be the install, but it wouldn't work. After hours on the phone with "Ann" representing Turbo Tax from the Philippines, she offered to give me a "voucher code" so I could do my return at their online service and not on my computers. When I didn't want to do this, she referred me to Microsoft and gave me the number to call. (They had been experiencing problems with this). Initially, through the Microsoft number I was given, I only got an automated system that referred me to Toshiba since my operating system came installed on my computer rather than me purchasing it outright as a separate package. When Toshiba couldn't solve the problem and even tried using filehippo to get the Microsoft program Turbo Tax said it required, they referred me back to Microsoft with instructions on how to discuss the matter with them so they would be willing to help because it appeared to be an operating system problem. The first person I spoke with took control of my computer to work through the necessary downloads (another person from the Philippines). After many more hiurs on the phone with no satisfactory results, he said he would have a "Level 2" person contact me within an hour. A little later than that, I received a call. When I answered the phone within three rings, they had already hung up. This happened at least twice. I received an email saying the designated time was "noon" that I had chosen to speak with them. When I attempted to respond to the email, it wouldn't go through to that address. I contacted Microsoft through their website requesting a qualified technical person and received a response to go to their online support services, and if that didn't help, to call the number back. After the work yesterday with Microsoft and later running McAfee on my computer and another optimizer program, my computer is at the point of being almost non-functional, not more optimal. With my taxes due, I am in the process of transferring my data to an external hard drive so I can "borrow" my mother-in-law's computer to complete my returns. I will most likely have to purchase a new computer. Based on the experience I've had and the lack of knowledgeable support from Microsoft, I have doubts that I will purchase a Microsoft based computer. Apple can't be any worse than what I have experienced with my Microsoft products over the years. I have also used Turbo Tax for years, but again will be hesitant in ever using it again with the problems I've experienced and the days I've wasted because they sent a program out that they knew was defective. My computer is practically non-functional and I will most likely need to replace it with a new laptop. I lost my job last week and need my computer for job search and training.
I filed my 2009 federal and state tax return on 1-28-2010 using TurboTax software installed on my iMac. TurboTax calculated that I would receive a $342 refund. On 4-5-2010, I received a letter from WI State informing me that my 2009 taxes were corrected so that I would now owe WI State $364. I went back and verified my returns for 2009 and discovered that TurboTax had in fact made a $364 error when calculating my 2009 tax return.
I have used Turbotax products for years. I have never been successful downloading update information to my PC (now use Mac), but have been satisfied with the update CD. In previous years, the CD could be ordered on line. This year it was mandatory to use a phone system. The system is suppose to confirm your order via e-mail. I have attempted to order this CD twice. I did not receive a confirmation e-mail in either case and I have not received the final update CD (released March 25, 2010. The online tool to ask questions was not helpful and I tried calling the support center. Needless to say, I had to repeat all information at least 3 times and they were completely unable to help in any way. Rather than admitting they could not assist, the operator (Martha) just repeated the same questions. I understand why updates are necessary and by nature last minute, but the current method of order entry, order confirmation, and tech support is so poor, I have to question the quality of the entire product line.
TurboTax Deluxe 2009 has had many install/update issues. I have had to re-install, repair and re-update multiple times, only to end up at the same result. Either a 5639 or 5640 error or worse, a critical application error and it needs to close. The latest was simply checking on my e-file status. I hate dealing with this crap when I have real work to do. Kiss that guarantee goodbye if they can't even make the software work properly.
I used this tax program in the past and never had problems like I had this year. My wife and I file our returns jointly. I am retired Military and Federal excepted service employee. My wife is a registered nurse and works for a hospital in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. All her income is earned in PA. I work as a Real Estate Associate in New Jersey. I have been out on sick leave and although I did not earn any income I did incur some size able mandatory bills that are associated with Real Estate. The tax program said that there were changes for this year and I had to file three (3) returns, Federal, New Jersey and PA. The tax program kept entering my retirement income into the PA return and I could not get it right. I ran the tax checks and fixed what it said had to be fixed. Finally it said we did not owe any money and would not get any refund even though my wife paid $2924.21 in local tax to Philadelphia, and $512.94 in PA state tax. In recent years, the monies paid to PA was part of a reciprocal agreement between PA and NJ and we would get a refund on our NJ return. This year, we now owe New Jersey $679 and I have doubts our Federal return. We would always get a CD in the mail to load the tax program this year, they said it was free, but you had to pay when you filed. I don't see how they can say it is free. It is the same only they don't have to pay to create a lot of CD's. Well right or wrong my taxes are filed in time.
Why is Turbo Tax Deluxe like a bar of Dial soap? Both have been discontented without any notice on the label. Where a bar of Dial was once a slightly rounded rectangular shape, it now has a great hollow where soap used to be. Outside wrapper is unchanged. I have purchased and used TT Deluxe for over 15 years. Until the 2009 edition, it took care of Schedule D and had an override entry feature. It no longer does Schedule D and I have not been able to find the override entry feature. No indication on the TT packaging that it has been discontinued. Since I would not trust the software to prepare any sort of final return, I use it to get a close approximation and prepare the extension form. There are workarounds for the Schedule D deletion. Nonetheless, I feel cheated. A rather slimy way to do business.
In 2007, TurboTax online version decided my military retirement income was not taxable. I got a bill from the IRS in Sept 2009 for $6,500.00. I have spent numerous hours on the phone with several agents from TurboTax, including Bob in CA, Office of the President. I filed a claim in small claims court, mailed them the summons which they ignored, tried to mail it to the address in AZ that they gave me, and had that returned un-served because they told the sheriff it needed to go to Delaware. Bob's answer was just to drop the suit, consumers never win and we are too big a corporation. I just received another bill for 2008, $6,010.00 because TurboTax did the same thing in 2008. You can't sue them, they keep sending you to different addresses to serve the summons, and you get no answers except you messed up. Someone tells me how to start a class action suit against these ****. The only answer I got from them is that the data I imported from 2006 was wrong which messed up my 2007 taxes. Thing is I didn't use TurboTax in 2006, I used Liberty. How can they import anything that doesn't exist?
Turbo Tax for 2009 for business that includes S Corporation has the wrong dates for when quarterly estimated payments are made. The dates listed are for personal estimated payments. Turbo Tax says that the money paid for estimated tax payments (FICA, SS, etc) is to be totally refunded to us. There is no way that is possible. Have emailed and searched for answers on their site but cannot find an answer to the problem. No way to call or contact. I now have to hire someone to rectify this problem. Cannot file personal taxes until this is resolved. I have Turbo Tax for about 8 years both personally and professionally and will not purchase it again! Hours of aggravation trying to figure out if I had made a mistake or if it was Turbo Tax. Could be in great trouble if I had really believed the Turbo Tax refund amount.
Audited by South Carolina Dept of Revenue. They indicated an error in the tax return. Intuit's TurboTax Deluxe State software for South Carolina for tax year 2008 does not properly handle from SC1040, lines 48a, 48b and 48c (retirement deduction). According to SCDoR, at least one of the three lines must have an amount of zero. Audit by state of South Carolina resulted in notice of adjustment requiring taxpayer to pay an additional $952.
I have the same problem as others with errors in state program resulting in tax balance. No way to reach TurboTax to resolve matter.
I could not contact anyone at Turbo Tax! I have used Turbo Tax the previous 7 years without problems. However, this year may have problems, i.e. when trying to e-file, it tells me I am not online which I absolutely was! It happened many times. Also, when I asked for it to audit my input, it would not do so. It would not reflect my W-2 amount even though it was correctly inputted. Also, even though I had purchased the deluxe model with state tax included, they charged me again for the state tax which is supposed to be included! After they charged me for the state tax again, I still could not e-file even though they showed the deduction for the charge. After reading the problems others have had, you can be assured I will not use Turbo Tax again! They need to be reported to the BBB.
I have used this product for the past 5 years with no problems. Used the 2009 Delux version, and when I completed my input, a window pops up and asks me to wait while it determines which of the needed forms are available. After a long wait, it gave the list of unavailable forms... everything I'd just filled out! Said they would be available soon, and I should email TurboTax, so they could let me know when the forms were available. Funny to me, that at IRS.gov, the forms are all there for download!! Since I don't want to take a chance of my return being late, I'll use the IRS forms and fill them out myself. I'll chalk the $50.00 lost up to experience, and won't take that chance again.
Don't buy a TurboTax product from Intuit online. I purchased the Premier version of TurboTax online, tried to download it, and it came with a virus. Luckily my anti-virus software caught the infected file and removed it. However, the TurboTax product would not download without the virus. When I tried to call Intuit, the number on the web page is not connected. I finally found a number after repeatedly going through a maze of 'contact us' locations. Then I waited for a representative. It took several minutes for a person to answer the phone. Pamil is the name he gave. I explained the issue and asked for a refund. He said he had the information on my purchase and he would process a refund. After a bit, he said that I had already received a refund. I asked for the confirmation number, and stated that I didn't believe him. No one had been asked to process a refund, and I doubted that the system did it by itself. Then he said that it was too soon to get a refund; it hadn't been five minutes. I should call back. I told him that was quite inconvenient. Intuit would gladly take my money and provide a virus along with it, but wouldn't give a refund? Why did I need to call back? He said, "We haven't received your invoice." "Really," I said, "you just indicated that you had my information. How can that be the case if you haven't received my invoice? Why should I have to wait and call back?" Why couldn't they call me when there was verification that the refund was complete? Pamil, stated that they can't do that. I would have to call back. I asked to speak to his supervisor, was put on hold with terrible music. After 1 minute or 2, a phone started to ring. It rang more than 15 times, went to an answering machine that said "leave a name and number". Right, I left a message indicating that I had no reason to believe that they would call back, that Intuit's service was very poor, and I would spread the word. I'm out $76.
We have a problem. We buy this year after year. It screwed up my taxes. We had a real mess. We will buy no more! I'm out $75.00, and they said they would take care of it. Liars. They did not. Shame on you. I am a senior citizen.
Turbo Tax 2009 Delux version. Software bug: I have 58 short term trades in Schedule D ATM form. But only 50 trades will registered in Schedule D1 form. So the calculation for Schedule D is totally wrong. It appears that Schedule D1 form has a 50 items limit for short-term. It is frustrating for me that I can't override Turbo Tax on this error. I have to wait for them to fix the software error.
I purchased the Turbo Tax Deluxe ( auto re-new from year 2008). I loaded this CD after the company's 60 day return policy. I cannot get the company to respond to requests for help on the internet. I already paid $63.55, and I can't get the CD to work, after all suggested fixes! I want to pay Fed/State taxes by April 15th!
I filed my taxes with Turbo Tax Online and it said that both my state and federal forms were accepted. When I checked again two days later, it then said that my federal was rejected for reasons of year of birth and AGI reported. I had to go back in and fix the errors that I hadn't made in the first place. They guaranteed that people should receive their refunds in 8-15 days. What a joke. I received my state refund about a month later and I still have not received my federal refund. I paid for them to have the payment deducted from my taxes. I filed my taxes on 2/18/2010. What about the guarantee that they offer? Can someone please tell me how I can get some of my money back for filing with them? This seems to be some sort of false advertisement. I, just like other people, have bills to pay and have promised creditors payment as soon as my taxes were received. I have been stressed as to whether or not my taxes were done right and if indeed I will receive the promised amount seeing as though I did not receive my refund in the time that was guaranteed and the trouble I went through to get my return to be accepted.
Like some of the other users, I have used Turbo Tax for 5 years. This year, I entered my data, and when I went to eFile, the program asked me for "one more thing" it wanted the wages from my W2 box 1. I entered the number and hit sent. As soon as I hit sent, it doubled my income and suddenly my refund went to a great big red I owe screen. I also tried to call Turbo Tax. Good luck, you have to submit a problem first on the website and get an incident number. Eventually, I talked to a person and she said, this is the first she has heard of this and offered no help. She told me I may need to file an amended form and offered no assistance. Turbo Tax will not be in my future!
I have used TurboTax for years. This year, in order to file a 1041 form for a trust, I used TT for Business, devoting many hours to filling in all the forms, having been warned by others not to attempt downloading. Having finished the Federal return, I decided to buy and download the state form. The instant this was done (as I attempted to move to the next screen) all of my previous work vanished, to be replaced with a 510 error message. The pleasant TurboTax phone representative was completely clueless and could only tell me that I would have to start all over again, that the file (although still in the computer) could never be retrieved. At least, she agreed to refund the cost of the state program. TurboTax? Never again.
Using Turbo Tax made an error in calculation on my State Taxes and I checked my input data twice to see if I needed change anything. I could not find any errors on my part. The amount of return they calculated was ridiculous. I attempted to get help from the support avenues but when I did get through to a Robert **, his first question was, what level of service did I use and then directed me to the Print File menu. His page promptly disappeared and that was that. It is upsetting that Turbo Tax is so unhelpful and when they are in error, there is no recourse or support. I am filing my taxes but with the help of an account. I plan to write to the AG here in NY and the BBB.
I have been using Turbo Tax (Intuit) for over 5 years and I have never had a problem until now. I was reminded to renew and purchase the Premier edition in Oct 2009. I promptly received a hard copy, but didn't install it until I had tax data. I don't recall any serious issues with the installation, but almost immediately I noticed that the program would "crash" (shut down and/or start the Turbo Tax web page) unexpectedly and for no obvious reason. This happened when I tried to import data, transfer data from last year or even when I tried to input data into a field and press "continue". I called Turbo Tax in February and explained the problem. I updated the program, uninstalled and re-installed the program and finally I was given a "fresh" version downloaded for free. The problem persisted and I finally learned to "save" my data after every input, but the program still crash when trying to run a re-check or when it tells me to go back and correct errors. Ultimately, I did finish and was able to print and save a complete Fed and State tax return. I did not eFile with TurboTax and I was not happy with the whole concept of completing my return "online" since I don't trust anyone with the security of my financial data. After a 15-minute online wait, I was able to establish a live chat with a Turbo Tax tech who was very apologetic, but who was unable to come up with any fix to this persistent problem. Ultimately, I was given a full refund of my $89 purchase price and their sympathy that this was happening. Like I said, I am a loyal Turbo Tax user and I love the product when it works! I don't know if I will use Turbo Tax 2010 unless and until someone acknowledges the problems inherent in the current version and is confident that these issues have been resolved.
I just discovered this excellent site. My problem has been dealt with, but I think it’s useful to pass my experience on. I completed my 2008 return and pressed the button to e-file and give permission to IRS to take the money due from my checking account. Several weeks later, the funds were still in my account so I called the IRS. They had never received my return and I later received a bill for back taxes, interest and penalty from IRS and State. Turbo Tax said they had no responsibility, and that I should have checked my email for confirmation a few days after submitting the return. I had failed to do that in my exuberance at filing the return a day before it was due. I think TT should have a program in place to check the electronic filing and notify the user. Buyer beware.
TurboTax did not register the $22,000 in college tuition and fees we paid in 2009. TurboTax did not ask us about or report college tuition or fees we paid, a simple deduction of over $22,000
I used Turbo Tax online to file my 2009 return. The program loop me back to buy the audit defense option ($39.99) twice. I buy the first time, I was very unease to click the second time. But the computer screen wrote " Please click, you will not be charged twice". But they charged me twice (each time $39.99). I called Turbo Tax customer service. After 20 minutes of hold, they told me Audit Defense is another company (which I never aware, it is part of Turbo Tax on line program). They want me to call another 800 phone. I am in endless loop. They are not honest. It is cheating.
I'm trying to file 2009 taxes with Turbo Tax online. 98% of the time, I can't get connected or logged in. If I do, I get disconnected. The website keeps indicating server problems. This has been going on for about 3 weeks now. I can't access Technical Support online and the automated support doesn't recognize the questions. Intuit should make a public statement and offer online filing free for all the inconvenience. I've been using Turbo Tax for more than 10 years.
TurboTax Basic has a defect in it. It would not allow me to file electronically even after spending hours to follow up on all suggestions for fixes. In this forum, I found that others had the same experience as me. Intuit ought to be embarrassed for selling a defective product on the basis of a deceptive selling point and not warning users not having a fix for what is really a simple problem. Shame on you Intuit and shame on me for buying your product. Worst of all, you publish no email or telephone number to contact a company representative so that you might learn first-hand what bugs exist in your software.
It looks like my situation has happened to other people as well. I was about to e-file my return (I was expecting refunds from the IRS and MA) when TurboTax "discovered" an error with my W-2. I fixed the error by entering the amount for "Box 1". Once I fixed it and clicked on "send", I discovered that I now owe the IRS and Massachusetts a lot of money. TurboTax had actually doubled my W-2 information and my income tax shows 2x what I actually made in 2009. I am now hoping that the IRS and Massachusetts Dept of Revenue will see the problem and reject my return so I can fix it properly (but with what though?) TT will simply file a bad one again? How long does an amended return take? When will I get my refund? Thanks a lot, TurboTax! I won't be using you anymore.
This year, I decided to use TurboTax instead of my accountant. I thought I would save money. Well, I filled out info for Federal, got to the end, put in my credit card info, briefly saw the 1040 filled out, saw an error on capital loss line(I know I put in the correct info.), and then quickly saved and logged out. I did not complete the transaction and did not continue to finalize the e-file. Next thing I know, I have an email from TurboTax showing my credit card was charged. I filled out the more expensive version as I had capital loss. I also requested the legal representation at an additional cost ($39). I immediately called the number given on the website and got someone in India I could barely understand. He told me he couldn't do anything and gave me another number. I called that number, but they were closed. I called the next day and got a woman who tried to help me. After about an hour, the problem could not be fixed. Totally frustrated, I asked if I could just get my money back in full. She said yes. I did get a partial refund but did not get the $39 back that was for legal representation. I called and got India again. They told me I would have to call this other number they gave me. That number was incorrect, and there wasn't any answer. I called my credit card company, and I'm disputing the charge. I went back to my accountant and ended up spending less than I would have paid for TurboTax, got my forms back in two days, signed, back to accountant, and e-filed. A lesson learned: Don't use TurboTax!
I last used Turbo Tax for '06 taxes and never had a problem. This time, I ran into all kinds of trouble. Their free help screens are useless as well. My first problem occurred when I mistakenly checked a box in my federal return. I couldn't uncheck it and because of that, I was required to answer subsequent questions that did not apply to me. I looped through the software numerous times to no avail. Finally, I decided to move on to my state taxes. My state return worked without a problem--which is curious since the information in my federal return is applicable to my state return. But before filing, I had to fix my federal return. Turbo Tax informed me of the need to fix my federal return after I had already paid for their services! I had to loop through the fed software a number of times before both returns could be e-filed. But I had no idea what I had done to solve the federal problem leaving me with an unsettling doubt as to the validity of returns. I found out the next day that my state return had been rejected. No problem with the fed return that had given me all the problems. Turbo tax indicated the problem vaguely but did not direct me to the area I had to fix. The software said it would help me through it step-by-step but instead, I was looped through two pages--one that indicated there was a problem and one that had me "Continue" which put me back at the first page. Eventually, I was able to find the area of the software where I thought the software was and reentered some information. I e-filed the state return again and so far, it's accepted. I'll be holding my breath until I see my refund in the bank--still not confident of return accuracy. I would guess I spent at least two hours longer than necessary trying to figure out Turbo's software. It was very glitchy and there was no one to talk to about it even after having paid for it. There was no way I was going to pay any extra money to talk to someone either. For the time I spent using Turbo, I could have hired a tax preparer and saved myself a lot of anguish. It made me mad as hell that I had to spend my valuable time messing around with an inferior product with a totally useless help system.
Just prior to e-filing 2009 TurboTax asked for my wife's employer box one amount and the work address. I entered that information and it said all ready to go and I sent the form to the IRS. I noticed that rather than a refund I now owed a considerable amount of money. TurboTax had doubled my wife's income! The support at TurboTax is horrendous. I could not reach a person. At least they have a web page on their site admitting the bug, but they have no fix. The IRS now thinks I owe them quite a lot of money. Since TurboTax won't help, I must keep calling the IRS until they say they have processed the form (from 3-10 weeks) and then file an amended 1040X by mail.
I used 2009 Turbo Tax Deluxe to do my son and mother's Federal taxes. Once the information is input for the Federal, TT uses that to do the state taxes. Both my son and mother got a letter from Indiana State Dept of Revenue saying their returns were incorrect. There is no live person at TT to talkto so how do you resolve this issue? I paid money to have TT do my taxes wrong?
The first return I filed was rejected because the AGI I had to enter for ID purposes was rejected as incorrect. They have my name, address, SSN, phone #, etc., so why in hell do they need last year's AGI or a PIN for ID anyway? TT has no provision in their FAQ's or support for verifying or correcting that. I spent hours trying to get it fixed through TT, to no avail. I called IRS, got a PIN from them and re-submitted. No reply from IRS for a couple weeks, so I called today. The original AGI I sent was correct, and the re-submission with the PIN never got to them. I tried to re-install TT today and got an error saying I needed to download a .NET fix, which I did. After two tries, TT still says it can't install until I get the .NET fix. I'm going to try getting a refund from Walmart, re-file manually and put TT on my ** list for good.
The Turbotax Deluxe did not upload. I have used the program in the past without any problems. This year, it is different. I have spent a total of 98 minutes on the phone without ever getting a response. I also sent an e mail and this was also not answered. With a supposed brand name and numerous commercials, you would think that the company would have a "working" help desk on hand. I will not use this product again and will advise anyone that I know about the inferior service provided.
There is a huge error in their software. I entered my long-term capital gains and instead of calculating the amount at 15%, the program calculates it at 28% as ordinary income. I called the "hotline" (yeah, what a joke) and was placed on hold for over 20 minutes. The idiot that finally answered said, "Only 20 minutes? It is usually much longer than that!" When I explained the issue to him, his response was, "Well, do you want your money back?" This program is a joke.
I e-filed two returns on Turbo Tax. When filing a third return, an error message pops up and says I have filed 5 returns. This was, of course, after it had taken the $19.95 charge for the return. The tech support kept me on the line for an hour before telling me there was nothing they could do, that I would have to paper file the return or go elsewhere. I did go elsewhere. I lodged a complaint with the Better Business Bureau. That is $82.95 for the product and the credit card charge for a return that was never filed.
TurboTax prepared my 2009 Fed/State Income Tax (and for the past 12 years). An error was made involving Form 1040 line 20 Document(Earlier Year Lump Sum) to be used on 2009 Return. They used incorrect 2008 Lump Sum document (in fact , there was no Lump Sum Report with our 2008 Return). The 2009 Lump Sum Social Security Worksheet shows a -$29361 Lump Sum on Line 19. I mailed our 2009 fed and state returns about June 2010.They showed an overpayment and refund due of $4433 on Federal and $2123 on California. It took me some time to figure out what happened, in fact yesterday was spent with my broker who is a CPA, and we agreed that TurboTax had made the error. My dilemma is trying to talk to a person at TurboTax. I did get an audience with Ask Tina, a question/reply e-mail conversation and that is where it stands. My unhappiness is that I didn't realize that they had made the error which will produce refunds from Fed and State. Then I will have to get correct returns from TurboTax and pay what I owe. This is embarrassing. The real question is why I can't talk to a real person on the telephone. I completed my question and answer conversation with e-mail Tina last night. This is a problem that someone could have avoided. I am just waiting for an answer from TT.
Attention all TurboTax customers: I have spent a total of 10 hours online, 3 hours on the phone, and was transferred from country to country and department to department. I submitted numerous complaints. After an "agent" told me he was duplicating my returns and needed to connect onto my computer and view my personal information, I called to request a supervisor. I spoke to 3 of them, a total of 5 reps, and got hung up on. I still don’t know if my personal information is secure, and who has it. I still have no idea why my return is over $644.00 short or why TurboTax software doesn’t recognize that NYC has a separate tax that you must pay. I was finally able to get the address of the Office of the President of TurboTax. I will be sending him copies of all my conversations, as well as a copy of the 2 hours worth of conversations with their terrible customer service reps/agents/supervisors (yes I taped them because I’m concerned about my identity). After TurboTax guaranteed me no errors, returns are accepted by the government, and $675.00 will be deposited into my account, I guaranteed that money to someone else, only to come to show I received only $30.61. TurboTax software didn’t add on the NYC tax, even though I submitted returns on a NYC form. My address and school district is also NYC. The uncertified, unlicensed agent tried to connect to my computer to view my personal info. I got so scared it was a hacker. I called the bank to freeze my accounts.
I purchased this program around February 20, 2000. I have used Turbo Tax programs for 4 years. The last time, I did not use the Deluxe, and I certainly expected to get at least as good a result this time, but I am very unhappy with it, as this program will not install. I purchased the program at Office Max in Rocky River, OH.
I used them to file my SC State taxes this year in January and have not received my refund. I should have received it in three weeks. No damage resulted. They just misrepresent what they do. Last year, I used Tax Act and had my refund in 14 days.
I was trying to file my taxes online as I was offered a free TurboTax filing. The information I filed was incomplete and I had more data to input but then it wanted me to pay for adding more input and I refused. I did not file my return and I did not pay for their product. I just want to retrieve my personal information and find a human being I can talk to.
This is my 4th day of dealing with loading updates. I have restarted, restored, downloaded until my teeth ache. I could have simply taken the paper forms and been done days ago. Their support consists of a maze of recorded messages and download sites, none of which have worked. I'm not sure if I could sue for mental pain and anguish, but certainly feel like it. I finally did get a number for support that would be answered by a real person and have now been waiting and listening how important I am to them for 25 minutes and my cell will die before they answer. Support is non-existent, and the product sucks.
I filed my 2009 Tax Return on March 1, 2001. Today, I get an email stating that my AGI and/or pin got rejected from my Federal Tax return. The return is $11.00. On my State of Maine return, it's $0.00. And for no return on my Maine State Return, you charge me $27.95. Thanks for nothing. For $11.00 on my Federal Return, I could care less about fixing the rejection.
On 3/2/10, I bought a 2009 tax prep software Turbotax at Costco and because of all the issues raised on this site, I first read the box it came in, examined the "requirements" section on the box side and went to the support site listed thereon. Then, I read that my computer better have .Net Framework 3.5 sp1 or Turbotax will load it into my computer. I have it already on my computer so I don't think I'll have any issues.
I am unable to install TurboTax on my Desk PC with Windows Vista because of conflict with windows file (I tried uninstalling the file and it still would not install). I tried it on my laptop with Windows XP and had the same problem. My conclusion: TurboTax is neither fast nor easy. I wasted better than a half day on this problem. The economic loss was the 49 dollars I paid for the program and my loss of time when I could have been doing something more constructive.
I filed my taxes on 2/16. They said direct deposit on 2/26; there was no money so I called IRS refund line and they said by the 3/9 turbo tax states direct deposit within 8 to 14 days. Baloney.
I purchased the TurboTax Business version at Costco in February 2010, after successfully using this product for the past four years. This year after I entered my data, I noticed that the amount owed kept shifting even though I had not changed any numbers, and when I erased numbers, the amount did not return to where it had been previously. Then I tried to enter my SEP for this year and it kept increasing the amount of tax that I owe. I know this can not be the case and no matter how hard I tried I could not get the program to respond correctly. I called the company and was on hold for over an hour the first time, then after speaking with someone who obviously did not know anything, I was transferred and kept on hold for another hour. When I did get someone, they did not listen to what I said, and kept telling me to do what I just told them that I had already done. After two hours of going around and around they told me to re-enter all my data, and never admitted there is an obvious bug in the system. I have several advanced degrees and do not appreciate being treated like a moron, it really felt like I was being Toyota-ized.
I was able to get the TurboTax technical support people to admit that there is a bug in their Premier version for investments. A schedule requires that the total sales value of all transactions are added up; if this exceeds a certain value, the TurboTax software will go berserk, take hours to run, give you misleading messages, and not allow you to efile. So if you have a lot of investment transactions with TurboTax and it suddenly acts suspiciously, then you have just bought the farm. Hopefully, TurboTax will fix this 1950's type limitation built into their software now that they have told me that it exists. Note that they didn't warn me that this limitation exists, nor will they tell that it exists if you ask. You will waste countless hours of your time and have to physically print out and mail in your return.
TurboTax Basic made incorrect assumptions that resulted in my taxes being incorrectly filed. The good news is that the IRS "rejected" my e-file return. I spent a few hours, much of it on hold, trying to call the IRS or Social Security. And I think I have everything fixed. The Turbotax software assumed that because both my husband and I collected social security that we both had received a $250 economic recovery check from the economic stimulus bill. This question was never directly asked in the TurboTax interview. As it happens, my husband did not receive the $250 check. He still works, and he got his $250 in payroll tax deductions. This probably is not an unusual circumstance, so there is really no excuse for assuming that we both got a check. Anyway, TurboTax figured our taxes incorrectly. We actually owed less money after I corrected their mistake. I am glad I e-filed, since the IRS software caught their mistake right away. But I sent in a check for the wrong amount, and I'm sure there will be a wait to get my $250 back.
This software program would not load. I've used TurboTax for over 10 years. This year is the first time I've had problems. I called and tried to get help, but this is too much work. I hate to pay good money just to be given one headache after another with this program. What a waste!
While my experience started out simply before I was able to complete the process, I had lost all confidence in TurboTax Online to complete the tax filing process. I was asked for forms that do not exist in that application. When I tried to proceed I was sent back to login page. When I attempted to resolve the problem with an online chat agent, she was of no assistance at all. After waiting nearly 20 minutes for a response, I was told that the session had ended. At that point I was unable to conclude what had happened with regard to both State & Fed. returns and was unable to pursue any resolution with TurboTax.
I bought the 2009 TurboTax Deluxe at Costco. The software installed itself correctly on my PC with Windows XP. I completed both the Fed and the CA returns, saved them but did not print or e-filled them. I returned the next day to continue the various reviews and finalization when troubles started! TurboTax refused to recognize the saved file *.tax2009. Each time I requested to continue, TurboTax would shut down without warning. It only allowed me to start a new tax return. Using "Add/Remove Software," I attempted to repair TurboTax. Repairing failed. I was advised that my \Microsoft.NET\framework\v2.0 was not compatible with TurboTax. This is not correct because TurboTax uses .NET v3.5 SP1 which is included on the TurboTax CD. I uninstalled and reinstalled TurboTax, allowed it to download the lasted revisions, started a new return, completed this return and requested to proceed with the CA return. TurboTax advised that it needed to download the CA forms and their revisions, that it would shut down TurboTax and restart it at the point I left off at. ***! It again failed to recognize the saved file *.tax2009 and shut down without warning. It only permitted me to start a new return. I then decided to install the program on my backup computer also with Windows XP whose latest .Net framework version is 2.0.50727. While installing TurboTax , it announced that it needs version 3.5 SP1, included on the TurboTax CD. I agreed to have it installed. Of course, the installation failed while getting latest updates so I followed their recommendations and downloaded their 78 MB w_perrelsuperpatch_ttax_2009.09.0100.exe file. Executing the software error 1335 occurred. I bit the bullet, returned to my main computer, uninstalled and reinstalled TurboTax, completed the Fed return, verified its correctness, saved it as a pdf, printed it and requested to continue with the CA return. Of course, the only option TurboTax offered it to download the forms, shut down and restart. I agreed, same problems occurred but rather than starting a new Fed return, I started a new CA return, manually inputting the Fed data. This workaround worked. It should be noted that I sought TurboTax online help but received absolutely none. So buyer beware!

This is a big no-care corporation, I guess. I paid $21.00 through TurboTax to e-file my money to my checking account. TurboTax did my calculations wrong, and I paid $54.00 for the disc. By the way, I have to do my state over again and mail it in. So I lost all the way around,.I hope both of you go out of business and I will never ever buy TurboTax again, and yes I called them, and got nowhere.
I had filed my income tax. I paid them with Visa, then received my refund from the federal. When I went to file a second income tax for my sister, the form called for an update on our Visa. Then I couldn't get an address to file a second income tax. I would only bring up my forms. I was informed to consult with Tina to no avail, then I tried the community address, also no help.
I had no problems with TurboTax Premier in 2007/8 for a return with many (about 2,000) investment transactions. In 2009, 260 of these looked like possible duplicate entries to Turbotax, and it wanted to check them in the Error-Check step, the last section of preparing your federal return in TurboTax. However, there is some problem in the way TurboTax has coded the software for this duplicate transaction checking routine, and once you click on one entry, the computer goes into a calculate loop (my laptop's CPU and memory meters peg at 99%) and stays there. My laptop has dual CPUs, 2 GB of DRAM, plenty of free disk space, and a huge swap file space just to make sure. It can handle the software for every other part of the return fine, so it is just this one feature that has a bug. I worked with two people at TurboTax, Taryn and Sarah, on this over live chat to get them to report this as a bug for them to fix. But they refused to do it, blaming me for it, even though everything they told me to try did not work. So even if they have a known bug, they will not step up and address it. They will just blow it off.
Just before transmitting my 2009 federal income tax return, TurboTax asked me to complete line 1 of my w-2. This is the line that contains gross income, etc. I had already entered this information, but re-entered it anyway, because I thought it didn't "take" the first time. After successfully transmitting my return, I discovered that my income had doubled! Instead of getting a refund, I now owed 4 times more than I was getting back. I had to file an amended (1040X) to straighten things out.
I have used Turbo Tax for about 5 years, with no problems. This year, it was a different story. No matter what I do or change, my federal taxes are rejected, because of a schedule M problem, which Turbo Tax completely did not cover in the interview questions. I talked to 3 different customer support people. One said there was a fix coming out on Feb 25th, but only to correct the interview questions. Another had me deleting forms right and left. Now, my return is such a mess. I don't even know what I should have, and of course it is still rejected.The third girl said they have a problem, and haven't got a clue how to fix it. Just where does that leave us, who are just trying to file a simple return. I'll tell you we're about $100.00 out, with the time you add up the cost of the program, and the "free" filing cost. It cost me a lot of sleepless nights, and I still have not received my refund yet, with bills waiting to be paid. I will never buy this product again, and I hope everyone else follows suit. I am looking at filing online now. I hope I don't have any more problems, because of the Turbo Tax attempts.
PS to my complaint a minute ago: Can find no snail-mail address on Turbotax website or product box or via Google, so impossible to reach them via snail mail, email, phone or semaphore.
TurboTax worked fine until just before e-filing. It said, "Form 1099-R (OPM) Simplified Method annuity starting date should be later than 7/1/86. Simplified Method line 2 (in box): June 1, 1987." But it is later! The attempts to fix failed. I could not file online. The tax return was quite OK on printout, so I will file that. I wait weeks longer, so I didn't need the $59 TurboTax. I could not reach TurboTax forum or company via their website, which kept telling me my password was wrong. Retrieving password from email repeatedly destroyed Turbotax form in which their temporary password was supposed to go. I could not bypass this block to compute and print state tax at all. TurboTax kept warning about minimum distribution from IRA, which was 100% irrelevant. And it’s impossible to print any intermediate pages en route to final form. A user gave that phone number, which I found is an insurance company.
i usually use TurboTax, but this year for 2009, I entered all my figures and expected TurboTax to do the thing. Well, on line 5 of the state return, they did not! I had it filed, and I paid $21.00 to do this. Now, the state of IL said it is wrong and I get no refund! Shame on TurboTax. I had relied on them. So next year, I will not be buying it!
I bought the software at Costco and there is no loading instructions. I used to put the CD in the A drive and it would load right on to my computer desktop. That does not happen with the 2009 Turbo Tax?
TurboTax 2009 Deluxe does not handle solar deductions correctly. It states that solar equipment installed in 2009 cannot be deducted until the 2010 tax return. Form 5695 for 2009 says that it can be deducted on your 2009 taxes. Are they coming out with a fix? I could have made a mistake that would have cost me.
I just have to say I originally posted my complaint onto this site a few weeks ago. I tried to download the CD and could not due to the error message that so many others are getting. I saved this site as a favorite and I periodically check back time to time and I see this Turbo Tax situation is a mess for so many others. What a rip off. I wanted to say my story has a happy ending (for me anyway). I returned Turbo Tax's worthless product to Wal-Mart and bought H&R Block’s version. Download was perfect. Wow, no error messages! Filed my taxes and got my refund within a couple of weeks. No problems. I wanted to spread the word. Do not waste your money on turbo tax! I'm telling everyone I know. And I will always purchase H&R Block's product and I hope Turbo Tax goes out of business. What a nightmare.
I purchased the TurboTax 2009 Deluxe edition. I have used TurboTax for 2 years before now. The only complaints I had in the past were: download time for updates (I have a Dial-up system - 5 1/2 hours), and last year the state updates didn't work so they sent me an updated disc. This year, I experienced the same download time for the federal updates and managed to get my federal return completed. I then went to start my state return. The state download didn't work. TurboTax acknowledged this and said a patch would be available no later than February 15th. There was no patch on February 15th, and there is none to date. The program goes into a loop with errors and "send error report" which upon completion cannot be sent either. There is a phone number to call to step you through the needed procedures to get your state loaded. Upon calling this number, a canned message replied with steps to do, which were no different than what I had already done many times, always with the same result, "searching for solution", and the solution was never found. It just began to update again and went into a loop. Last year, with the same update problems with the state return, I called (there was a number for help then), and they sent me a new disc. That worked. This year, along with their useless instructions, there is a note that says "state update CDs are no longer being sent". So what do I do now? I paid $54.99 for this problem and am no longer certain that the federal is done correctly. And, I have no state return. P.S. Today, I tried to access the program and a message came up saying I must reinstall TurboTax 2009 because there is a signature error. I cannot access my federal return, or any of the information I provided to them to prepare the federal return. And, I have no state return. Luckily, I did print one copy of the federal return, so I can figure my state from that. If there is anything you can do to help me it would be so appreciated. Thank you for your time.
Virginia state tax calculations are ridiculous. There has been lack of any response to complaint. I have to file paper calculations.
I have been using the Turbo Tax online software for several years now with no problem. However, this year for some reason it doubled my income at the very end after I clicked to file. On the click to file screen, it had me getting back about $2000 (which is correct); then it asked me to click to file and it started processing and then I got the "thank you" screen and the amount suddenly changed from me getting $2000 back to me owing $18,000. I immediately sent a request to Turbo Tax via online form since there is no phone number to contact them to have a rep call me. The rep called within about 20 minutes and was very nice and understanding (thank God because I almost lost it). She did a remote access thing into my machine and we walked through it together. I informed her that at the very end I kept getting all these weird "you forgot to do this and that" screens, which I know I filled out, but I did whatever it asked me thinking maybe I somehow just did not fill out that info properly. She and I were able to determine that somehow the software added my company from two years ago to my 2009 filing so that it looked like I worked at two companies in 2009 and it inserted my 2009 income into both my current company and my company from 2 years ago, therefore, making it as though I made double what I actually made. I only worked at one company last year and only made half of what the software was saying I made. She apologized and said there was nothing she could do. All she could tell me was to file a federal amend and a state amend (both are a big pain in the rear end). I called the IRS just to let them know what was going on and the IRS rep informed me that the call center reps had received an email regarding this issue and they were aware that phone calls would be coming through about this Turbo Tax ** up. She also informed me that I would be better off just filing directly through the IRS.gov website next year. Lesson learned: I will never use Turbo Tax again! Next year I will file directly with the IRS--no need to have a middle man, especially if they are going to make this big of a mistake. I still have yet to receive a follow up email or phone call from Turbo Tax. Guess it isn't really needed at this point since I will never use them again and I will also let everyone I know the nightmare I am having with them.
My daughter paid her own college education expenses in 2009. She is claimed as a dependent on my tax return and it was clearly marked on her return that she was claimed as a dependent on someone else's return. However, TurboTax 2009 calculated that she qualified for the American Opportunity Credit adding nearly $1100 to her tax refund. I carefully read the qualifying instructions and they were very clear that she does not qualify for that credit if she was claimed as a dependent on someone else's return. I deleted the education expenses and entered them again thinking I must have made a mistake, but I got the same results. I searched the internet for more information and I happened upon the Consumer Complaint site. Subsequently, I purchased H&R Block tax preparation software and in the first run-through, the software advised that she does not qualify for the credit. If you are doing your taxes using Turbo Tax 2009, please double and triple check the results. Wait a few days before filing, check for updates often. Ask a tax professional. H&R Block tax software comes with 1 free consultation, TurboTax does not. If I had not double checked the Turbo Tax information, the likelihood of being audited would have been very high.
I bought Turbo Tax at Staples. I guess I was lucky it installed OK. I did my taxes, got my state taxes installed, got through most of it, but in our state we have to prove that we had health insurance. No problem. I have a letter from my insurance company with all the information needed for my tax form. I put it in and it kept coming back. We need to revisit one more problem. Schedule HC worksheet penalty worksheet$17.00 penalty for having everything I needed. It sent me back every time I selected continue; it would send me back to the same place but in the meantime it told me I could e-file but that would cost me another $21.00. Well, I paid by credit card but it still would not file because we still had to go back to schedule HC. By now I have been back to that page at least 50 times (no lie). It finally gave me the choice of printing and paper filing. I told my printer to print and it just kept printing the biggest stack of schedule HC worksheets I have ever seen, and to top it all of the schedule HC page was properly filled in. But the many hours of frustration and the $60.00 I paid for the software and the $21.00 for e-file that can not be done because it always tells me just one more thing. I guess I will paper file and never ever buy Turbo Tax again. I am a senior citizen and the frustration was almost more than I wanted to deal with. The first evening I finally quit because I was crying and there is no place anyone can get help, only a computer that gives you no help whatsoever.
I sent in my TurboTax and it was supposed to be free but I sent it in and it took money out of my bank resulting in large overdraft. I want this fixed.
I bought the 1009 Turbo Tax software and attempted to do my tax return. In prior years you could go to any form you needed to complete. Not anymore. For instance, there is no form to calculate taxable Social Security benefits. Also I need form 8606 but it is nowhere to be found. I have used TT for many years but this year it is totally incomprehensible and I will never buy it again. $24.95 plus hours of wasted time.
I have used TurboTax each year to file my returns since about 2004 without any problems. This year it's different. My return was accepted by the IRS on Feb. 9th, 2010. Going to "Where's my Refund" on the IRS site, it said expect refund on 2/19. Checking on 2/19, it now says 3/2. I called the IRS and they said "there was an error that has been corrected", but they were unable to give me information as to what the error was and what the consequences were. Nor could they give me an official date of the direct deposit. There are not supposed to be errors after running through TurboTax's system of error checking. As a result of their error, TurboTax is costing me in delays and probably a reduced refund. I will have to check back with the IRS in a week to try to find out what the error(s) was/were and what the consequences are. I used the deluxe on-line version via a link from my credit union. A quick check on TurboTax's "accuracy guarantee" shows that online fees are non-refundable. I think they should refund this fee since the return was not accurate. I had intended to get my mortgage out of arrears with this refund. It's been costing me an additional $100 per month, and now this will continue as long as this refund is delayed (and the amount unknown). Also, my son's college costs are now in jeopardy.
I bought TurboTax to help my husband with his business. I cannot get past the first screen. I enter my husband's name, then a box appears to *search* for the problem. The whole thing shuts down. What a waste of money. I am not having any luck on the TurboTax website. I am discouraged and annoyed. This was very expensive, and I cannot file my husband's business taxes.
I filed my taxes with TurboTax 2009, the "free" on-line version. I was rejected four times, for needing a PIN number (which is supposed to identify me) and the $250 stim. rebate. I received the same PIN from the IRS three different times. Inserted it where indicated on TT, but it was still rejected. When I printed the TT that I filed, I noticed that I had included the $500 (filing jointly) stim. money. I knew my info was completely correct, verified by IRS and Social Security Admin but still rejected four times! Now I have been charged $66 plus dollars from TT. No way to get it back, and I still have to pay someone to do my taxes. I am a new widow, and am overwhelmed enough with everything else. I do not need this hassle and expense! I will not use TurboTax again, though we had no problem with it last year.
I, too, have used TurboTax for years to process my return. This year is a totally different story. I purchased the download from Amazon and uploaded just fine. However, every time I tried to enter information and hit enter or tab to get to the next field, the program goes to a window, "checking for solution", and then closes. I googled problems and got a phone number to get to TT help line (since it is nowhere to be found on their site), it is 800-854-3970 (press # # # to get to live person, after about 20 minutes). She tried to troubleshoot for me and wound up sending me a direct download for the Deluxe system. I removed the Amazon one, added the new one and tried again. And surprise, it failed again. I even tabbed through on pages to at least try to make the software calculate for me but got bogged down with answering a question. I don't know how to get this resolved but this is total baloney from a company that charges $45 or more per user for a piece of garbage. If anyone wants to start a class action, let me know! I'll gladly add to it.
I encountered numerous problems with TurboTax 2009 software. The Premier version failed to update the numbers I entered. TurboTax sent me another version. It did the same thing. TurboTax sent me Home&Business. No better. These are a few of the many problems I encountered on Premier and Home &Business versions: Numbers entered did not update no matter how many times I entered the same information; Calculations were wrong. It showed I owed no tax when I did; The numbers I entered showed up in wrong sections. I own real properties, but numbers I entered for one property showed up for another property; Even if I checked a certain box, it showed up as I checked a different box. I uninstalled and reinstalled the program four times. I rebooted my computer and reinstalled. I installed it on a different computer. I deleted whole sections and reentered numbers. Nothing helped, the problems continued. I talked to TurboTax three times (about two hours each time). They could not help except to send me new programs, all the same problems. Finally, I spoke to a supervisor, Kendrel (a man), for some 30-40 minutes. He emphatically said the problems were not TurboTax's. TurboTax program runs whatever the user enters. I went through several errors with him but he continued to reiterate that the programs only calculate whatever I enter. The company is saying it's my fault. I have been using Turbotax for six years and have advanced degrees.
I have used the free edition of Turbo Tax to file my Fed 2008 return last year with no problems. Now filing my 2009 Fed tax with Turbo Tax, I choose to import my previous years info for "convenience", which cost $14.95. I went through the filing process, and towards the end, I kept getting weird messages that I forgot to enter this or that. I re-entered all the info they asked for and reviewed at the end. The refund window at the top right corner was in green, and said I had a $1,023 refund. I went ahead and e-filed. I did not print the forms also, since I do not have a printer. Big mistake, the next morning I checked my email to see my Fed was already accepted by the IRS. Great, I thought. Went to the IRS website to use the "where is my refund" application, IRS said they had no record of my refund. I then logged into Turbo Tax to see if they had a refund schedule. Now on Turbo Tax, my refund has disappeared, and has been replaced by a red $531, meaning I now owe $531! No way. I checked my 1040EZ on the site, and they exactly doubled my income and have two exact W-2's for me. Makes no sense. I contacted the 'help' online, and they said, I could not get my $14.95 back because the online edition is not covered by their 100% Satisfaction Guarantee. Amazing, now I have to figure out the 1040 by hand, also do a 1040X by hand, and mail them to the IRS. I called the IRS and was told it will take about 3 or 4 months to process my refund. Turbo Tax is supposed to make filing easy, not screw people out of their hard earned money. I will never use Turbo Tax again! I lost my job in October, and had money to live until now. I thought my refund would cover my expenses for another month, which is why I filed the same day I received my W-2. I should have had my refund by now (I filed about a month ago originally). Now, I will be on the street tomorrow, unless I figure out something quick.
In preparing my taxes with Turbo Tax, they would not include my estimated tax payments and ended up telling me that I owed a large tax bill with penalty. Time was wasted, including all my tax information. I will not use them now, or in the future.
I filed my taxes online with Turbo Tax and apparently, the IRS has no record of it being done. I would like someone to call or email me and explain to me why.
I used the free TurboTax last year with no problem and I tried to use it again this year to file the federal. What a nightmare! Six times, it told me that my return was rejected because my ssn was wrong or my name was spelled wrong. I know how to spell my name but I still checked again and again and had my son just look to see if I was wrong. I need the money very badly so I figured I used to go to H&R Block and pay them and never had a problem so I found a free version for federal if you earned less than $55,000.00 so I tried it. I loved it and I was done in ten minutes and it's really ten minutes! Not only that they emailed and texted me that everything was okay. That was on February 15th 2010. On February 16th 2010, I was emailed from H&R Block that my return was accepted by the IRS. They told me to wait a few more days and check my refund on the IRS government website to see when I will get it. Well it's February 18th 20102 and I checked the IRS website just to try and they said that my check will be mailed on February 25th (the checks are mailed on Fridays). So, what I have learned is that if I had tried H&R Block on February 5th when I first had the problem with TurboTax, I would be driving my car now, not in two weeks. So thank you H&R Block! Please don't try or use TurboTax because you cannot get a refund and you will never get your taxes done. You can use H&R Block for free and if you don't like to use a company, the IRS will let you file for free using them; just go to the irs.gov website.
I paid $52.50 for a product that is buggy. I spent 15 years in software development and recognize buggy software when I see it. My return keeps getting rejected, and it is impossible to fix despite following the on screen instructions. It is a nightmare. I am now reduced to starting over with the paper form from the IRS.
I will never use TurboTax again. I don’t like it when it give one price and at the end of doing your taxes, the total is different.
I have filed my return three times today because it has been rejected for the recovery payment from last year. Now, I have checked the "yes" box each time and the return keeps getting rejected stating that the IRS is saying I did receive the recovery payment. Well if I am saying 'yes' and the IRS is saying 'yes', why is my return continually rejected? After reading on Turbo Tax's website this problem has happened with many people and yet Turbo Tax says they cannot fix the problem. Well how am I to file my taxes if the site does not work and will they refund the money I paid to have my taxes filed, even though is says free? My father is dying of lung cancer and is in the hospital. My return is suppose to help me travel to see my family and that may not happen. If I do not get to see my father before he dies his blood will be on their hands!
I filed with TurboTax and received a confirmation number that it was complete and was charged for using the product. After 3 weeks and no refund, I called the IRS since my social was not found during the IRS refund search. I finally reached a person and they stated that no return was filed. We reached TurboTax and they said something must not have worked, even though our confirmation stated that it went through. They refused to refund our money and they wanted us to re-file through them, charging us again. This has got to be criminal. I am a military moving and filed allowing plenty of time since I needed this money for relocation. Additionally, now I have to take my return and have someone else file it and get charged again.
I used Turbo Tax (for the first time) to prepare both State and Federal returns. Federal got rejected. When I went back to try and fix the errors, there’s no way to do it. No telephone number to contact anybody. So I have nothing for my money and will have to have someone else do my taxes. They "stole" $66 from me without giving me a satisfactory product.
I cannot complete my tax because of an error on their part, plus I was charged double the price that I agreed too. I asked for a refund and was notified that it was non-refundable. I want to do my tax online and the snag was the #5 employee contributions. They stated that my contributions could not exceed $3000.00 when my 1099-R listed $4236.96. I have used turbo tax "free edition" for several years. I could have filed the paper edition in the time I have spent wasting my time with Turbo Tax. Plus now, I seem to be locked into a contract that I cannot escape from. Please help.
Today, as apparently a myriad customers before me, my Turbo Tax Deluxe CD failed to install because the third party Microsoft .NET 3.5 framework with SP1 failed to install after six attempts, including shutting off my firewall and antivirus (as recommended). I finally got hold of Sara (in the Philippines by faking a different kind of problem on their nebulous support site), and she helped me go through the three step process recommended by Intuit. After each step, we tried to install with no success. That was nine times total! Sensing my frustration, she gave me two voucher numbers to allow me to file two returns using the TT Deluxe online. I must add she was very nice and probably paid fifty cents an hour. Nonetheless, I decided to do the online Deluxe edition which, and pay attention to this, does not charge one until they are finished and ready to file. I spent the rest of today filling out numbers, and when I was ready to print my return, the "Pay" page came up. I entered one of my voucher numbers and (are you surprised at this?) it did not work. It is 13 digits and letter, so maybe I didn't hear her correctly and entered the other. Are you ready? It didn't work either. I hope the H&R Block program is decent because I am going back to Staples tomorrow and demanding a change. The past three years of Turbo Tax were great, but they have lost me as a customer.
TurboTax 2009 software has multiple problems that cannot be fixed by the user after paying the fee to use the product. They tell you there is a problem with your taxes but, when you try to correct the problem, it will not allow you to do so. So obviously you cannot file your taxes with these errors. It also seems impossible to reach a human at Intuit or TurboTax. Even their "survey" sends out an error message and never goes through!
TurboTax 2009 failed me twice. I purchased the online version and the CD from Office Depot. I could not get the program to install because the required software Microsoft .NET 3.5 Framework w/SP1 was not installed on my PC. I spent all weekend trying to remove and install .NET 3.5 w/SP1. No luck. I am out $100 plus by purchasing the TurboTax Deluxe online and in the store.
I used TurboTax last year and did not have any problems. In October of last year I received, unasked for, a TurboTax product in the mail. It was a program I would never have used. Good thing I often check my Spam filter because a few days later, I received an e-mail from TurboTax telling me I had been charged $95.35 on my credit card of record for the product they sent me. I have since discovered that unless you go through a multistep process to indicate you do not want them to automatically send you the program they think you will need, they will send it and charge you the full retail price. They call this rip-off a "convenience". So, I immediately returned the product and received an e-mail notification informing me they received it and that they would process my return. It has been nearly three months and I am still waiting for my refund. I have called their customer service number numerous times and their representatives (foreign, of course) are polite but they can't do anything! I asked for a supervisor and he tried to insist I had been refunded. I know I have not been refunded because I called my credit card company and had them dig back through my account records. I tried resolving this with their online support, but they responded with apologies and told me to call them! After every contact (it has been about 15 now). I get these stupid "How Was Our Service? " surveys. Well, folks it is rotten. I am never going to use this company's products again. The sad thing is I actually like the products.
I purchased software for 2009 thinking I was going to get started with my taxes for January. I tried to install software and received a .NET3.5 Service Pack 1 Framework verification failed. Please repair it from Add/Remove Control Panel. Contact TurboTax Support. I called TurboTax representative and explained this error. They said they would send me another CD. In the meantime, I returned the product out of frustration! CD arrived and I said why not give this another try as maybe they fixed the software problem? Again same error, same software and getting stalled with preparing my taxes! I have sent a letter along with the CD back to Intuit? I'm wondering if they are going to make this right or if I will have to go back to another software competitor? I will be making this decision by next weekend as I am fed up! Maybe someone can recommend what should be done about this problem.
I filed my taxes using Turbo Tax free online. It stated that I will have my refund in as little as eight days, and it also said that I could find out the status of my refund in 72 hours. It has been 18 days since I filed my taxes. Where is my money?
I downloaded Turbo Tax to do my taxes online, entered all the information from W-2, my taxes are very basic. They told me I should get back $2,504 from federal and $390 from state. I filed on 2/2/10 and still have not seen my federal returns. The state sent me $46.00 and said the refund I claimed was more than what I should be getting back. I tried to get a hold of Turbo Tax, but the man, Brett **, I spoke with knew nothing about taxes. Well, I got scared. I figured something was wrong, so I went to an accountant to have my taxes reviewed. She said Turbo Tax estimated my federal too high, and state too low. She said that could be what’s holding up the federal; the state, she said, if I did not get a notice from the state that there was a mistake somewhere. I tried several times to get a hold of Turbo Tax, but it is a waste. I have to pay someone to amend my return. Do not use Turbo Tax! I paid them to mess me up! It cost me $29.00 to have my taxes checked and I am going to have to pay to have them amended. It cost me $59.95 just for Turbo Tax to do my taxes. I am still waiting for my money!
I experienced the same "glitch" in the Turbo Tax software. It occurred when I tried to complete my state taxes. I sent 3 error reports with my email address as requested by the error message in Turbo Tax and I still have not heard from them. Also, I tried the "live chat" route and was told, "Oh, they (support staff) don't work weekends and it will be a few days before they contact you." I uninstalled Turbo Tax 3 times before I could get it to go. I have used Turbo Tax for years, but I will not use it again. Their support stinks! I also ended up paying to file my state.
I haven't gone through the previous 58 pages of complaints so excuse me if this is redundant. I eFiled with Turbo Tax opting to take the direct deposit to a Turbo Tax debit card (I thought that would help keep track of expenses). I filed on 02/04/2010 and received my card today (02/13/2010). According to what is listed on the website, this delivery schedule, while being a day early was soon enough for me! Well, I received the card but my refund wasn't on it. I activated my card (because you have to speak to customer service) and asked why my money wasn't there. I was told by Amy that although they quoted 8-14 days on their website, that's just for when you would get your card, not for when you would get your funds. When I was on the phone with Amy, I looked at the IRS website which said my refund would be processed on the 23rd of February. Amy said that wasn't right, she had a piece of paper that says I would be paid on the 19th. There were so many holes in her story (i.e. if you look real closely, you'll see that 8-14 days is what it takes to get your funds. Her next answer was the government has 8-14 days to process to the Turbo Tax bank and they have 8-14 days to process as well). I told her at that point I would have been more prescient to drive to Washington, DC and come back with a check rather than wait for all these rumored dates. I asked how she knows it would be the 19th instead of the said Feb. 23rd and she assured me "she just knew". Now for the icing on the cake, I decided to piss myself off more and I went through all of their websites and the place where I had to register my card. It says that my billing cycle is from Feb. 07 2010 to Mar. 08, 2010. Well, if you don't make a certain amount of transactions in your billing cycle (30), you will be charged a monthly $5.95 charge (which also was not ever and I mean never quoted on their website). So essentially, by the time I get my money (anywhere from the 19th to infinity), I will have X less days to make my 30 transactions. I have plenty of ways around that (grocery shopping one item at a time? Just paying the ATM fees to withdraw all the money on the card?). But again, how can they hold me to a billing cycle that begins on 02/07 when the funds may not be available until whenever? I would advise anyone not to use this service. It's the night before Valentine's day and I'm writing you, have been on the phone for 2 hours with Turbo Tax instead of the steak and lobster I was going to have.
TurboTax free before purchasing. Product in some ways hard to use. Medicare deductions does not include Part C only part B & D. Not real clear not to add medicare B&C to medical premium deduction. No info as to medical mileage rate. Difficult to locate tab to input total sales tax receipts. Program wants to plug info based on income. No info on taxable Soc Sec benefits. No info on taxable unemployment benefits. Shows Fed errors because of not inputting 2008 info. Tax Act is much easier to use. Not confident on filing using TurboTax since I could not reconcile info. Tax Act reconciled to my records so I could see any error.
This is the third year I've used the online edition. It worked perfectly the last 2 years. However, this year, there are big problems when transferring the information from Federal to State. I kept getting error messages to correct amounts for amounts of a "disaster" that I didn't put in and then the software kept asking me to put in an explanation for form 1X. I simply typed in "carryover from federal" as the software only gives you a glimpse of the form 1X in question. Turbo Tax checked everything and read back that it's all 100% ready to go. I used my credit card and paid for the service. Before I clicked on "e-File" I wanted to see what was actually being sent in. To my horror Turbo Tax was going to send in the regular state income tax form 1 and also send in an amended form 1X. How the heck can the software make a mistake like that? I haven't even filed the form 1 in order to even think about filing the amended form 1X. Since I've paid, I can't go back and restart all over. So I'm stuck in limbo waiting for an e-mail response. If I don't hear from them in a couple of days, I'll simply dispute the charge with my credit card company and go through the hassle of using another company or filing them myself. What's up with Turbo Tax 2009?
Because of software glitch in their application, you may lose the ability to do your state tax for free. After filing your federal return, if the State does not work, they suggest you redo your entire return again, or you have to pay for the state fee. This has happened before, which is their way of getting extra fees for a known glitch in their application. In addition to the $89 I used to purchase the Home and Business version, which includes 1 Free State and 1 Free Federal e-file. I now have to pay an additional $29.99 to get NJ State again. In addition to this, it will take me an additional 10 hours to redo my taxes. I already spent 1 hour trying to get the problem resolved. I know will spend an additional 2 hours purchasing the same State again and trying to complete my state taxes.
I am reading about problems with Turbo Tax this year. I cannot even get it installed. Then I tried to uninstall and re-install, and I get error messages. I went to the website to troubleshoot; none of their solutions worked and I am stuck in limbo. Does anybody know a real solution? I cannot find a phone number to call for help. I just want my money back. I will file online thru my credit union--that will cost me more money. Got a survey from Intuit, gave them all lowest scores, and when I sent it got message "error while processing."
It is almost impossible to call TurboTax and talk to a real human. My problem appears to be in the software. But none of the FAQ covers that. TurboTax used my "adjusted gross income" to figure how much taxes I owed instead of the figures from "taxable income" which caused me to owe over $200 more in taxes. Good thing I had not sent it to IRS yet. But there are no telephone numbers posted in any of TT websites. You cannot contact them. Now what to do?
I had the same problem as John from Grass Valley, CA. When I was ready to efile, TT asked for verification of line 7 amount, which I did only to have the line 7 amount doubled on the filed return, boosting my tax bill form $538 to $32,000. Of course, once it’s filed, it’s filed; get to do form 1040X now. Of course, there’s no help from TT. The rep said he would file a "bug report", which does not help me any. Be wary if you get this verification screen before you efile your return.
I bought TurboTax again this year as I have for several years. I paid $59.95 for federal and state software. My problem came when filing electronically. TT wanted another $19.95 to file state and then another $29.95 to process the refund for direct deposit. A call to TT tax help confirmed. After a 20-minute wait—yes, those fees are required. Nothing TurboTax can do about it. IRS and the state of Virginia say they are not the reason for the fees. I plan to try one more time to get TT to waive the fees and if they do not, then I will never use it again. I may have to file a paper return this year to avoid the $50 fee. Delay in receiving the refund is the only real issue.
My daughter decided that she wanted to try doing her own taxes online this year and asked me to help. We decided to try the Turbo Tax free online edition. No problems until she got to the end and discovered that it would cost her $29.95 to complete her federal return. We finally figured out that somewhere in the process, she was automatically upgraded to the deluxe version of Turbo Tax and thus the fee. Further investigation revealed that we could not downgrade back to the free version. Instead, we had to repeat the process by opening a new account using a different user ID. She did this and got a different result on the amount of her refund. Even after double checking, all the numbers we could not find the cause. At this point, we lost confidence in Turbo Tax because we thought being upgraded from free to fee with no warning was a deceptive practice and also because the software would not produce consistent results. We abandoned Turbo Tax and used TaxAct instead with no problem. It turned out that the refund TaxAct computed agreed with that of our first run of Turbo Tax. While trying to figure out our problems with Turbo Tax by using their FAQ, we saw that many people were upset that they were being charged a fee for using a supposedly free software. Not warning people that completing their return may incur a fee is poor practice. Maybe Intuit made some money on those who went ahead and paid the fee (I think it was Intuit's strategy). I think that the bad will this practice has generated will lose them business in the long run.
Bug! Glitch! I have been using Turbo Tax for about 15 years. In 2009 year, I got married in Arizona. I imported ttax files for myself and my wife and we followed the directions doing the following scenarios: 1) married filing separate, and 2) married filing joint. It really screwed things up not taking in to account AZ community property rules placed by IRS. Trusting TTax, I went ahead and e-filed, only to have mine accepted and my wife's rejected 7 hours later with some phony form letter. Calling or contacting them is a joke. I went to my local IRS office to consult an IRS worker who immediately helped me figure out what TTax had done to me and my wife, ouch! I am now in the middle of a mess doing 1040x for fed and state AZ. Double ouch! Seeing other consumer complaints on all the "mystery" charges, I will carefully evaluate other products prior to buying tax software next year. Time lost, additional charges to fix their screw-up problem, the "free" gimmicks they market. Charges to be determined.
I used TurboTax free edition last year without any problems. This year TurboTax charged me nearly $100 to do a basic W2 return for one company. I was under the assumption it was the free version that I used last year. Their website is intentionally setup to draw you into the paid version without your knowledge. I contacted TurboTax twice now only to be turned away in a very rude manner. They basically said it's all my fault and there is nothing they can do. They wouldn't even try to work with me. Their customer service is simply terrible and they consider everything to be the customer's fault. If I had the funds, I would be hiring a lawyer to file a lawsuit against their company. They can say I was shown the charges and accepted them. However, I was assuming the charges would be zeroed out upon completing the e-file process. I really recommend people to stay away from TurboTax or at the least be very careful when you file your returns through their website. I know this happened to many other people. I even read a few complaints on the exact same issue before writing my own complaint. Other than the TurboTax customer support making me feel terrible, I lost $100 off my returns.
I was helping my son with the Turbo Tax in the internet. I never accepted an upgrade, because he wanted it free, like they always say on TV. they charged me $27.95 fee and $29.95 fee. I called immediately to cancel, but could not get an answer from anybody. This is a scam, and should not be advertised on TV as free. It is a downright lie.
I have always prepared my taxes using Turbo Tax since 2002 for myself and my family. I do not e file. I prepare the taxes and print and file for the federal and the state. This year I can only print one state form. Why is this? I tried to get an answer on line, but they did not give an answer. The product says I must pay $29.95 after I have already paid $74.95 when I purchased the product. In the past, I have been able to print the state for all the federal that I entered. I figure the taxes for all my children as well as my own. Usually six returns each year. I need someone to get in touch with me and tell me why they changed the way the program works as it was in the past. I would not have purchased this product had I realized I could not print the state return also. It allows me to enter the federal $29.95 fee. Would there be a $29.95 fee for each of the five returns?
This is in regard to TurboTax 2009. I was able to finish the federal, but for the state, there are software glitches that do not allow me to edit my state return. This is apparently a common problem. The only answer I am able to get is that several consumers reported this and it sends you to a link to update the program. This doesn't work, not just for myself, but others as per the community board. When I submit the problem, I get an email stating the same thing over and over. They aren't working. Another possibility is to delete and re-download the state filing, but it wants to charge you to re-download it. I purchased this product so I can get my responsibility completed. I am not getting support, I can not return this faulty product.
I have used TurboTax for 2 or 3 years now. I have the actual receipt of the online filing for last year yet it is impossible to pull in the past year’s information. I started to put in my 2009 information yesterday. Today, I cannot pull it up and I did save it yesterday. Also I continue to be sent to the page that wants me update my Explorer and Firefox. I have the latest and greatest operating systems. What has happened to TurboTax? What other online tax services are available?
TurboTax software is not working as it should and it's not my PC that have a problem as it acts the same on three different computers. There is no way to contact them and they want me to enter my phone number and they will call me for a charge of $24.00. I don't need help with my taxes; I need help with their software so why should I have to pay for that. They have already taken money from me to e-file but it is not complete yet due to a glitch in their software so I believe they should assist me without charge since I've already paid for something I haven't gotten yet.
I tried to open my 2002 personal tax returns but I could not. The file was there but the software was not. I called TurboTax a couple of times and I was told that I need to purchase the 2002 TurboTax software. I found and purchased it paying $49.95. I installed it and it asked me for a product key which I didn't have. I called TurboTax again and after hours on the phone, I was told that they do not support products older than 2005. I asked to speak to a supervisor and I was informed that one was not available and one would call though no one had.
I purchased a TurboTax CD Basic Edition on 2-5-10 at Target. The next day after struggling with my computer several hours to accept the download, I proceeded to to my taxes. After 2+ hours of preparing my taxes, at the end the TurboTax couldn't print out or finish my taxes. The reason was they said was that Turbo tax was waiting for an update for a form. I couldn't even print it out. I received an email that states from Turbo Tax: (Dear TurboTax Customer, Thanks for signing up to be notified when your forms are available. We'll send you an email when your forms are ready to be downloaded into TurboTax.). So bottom line is that I spent $24.95 for a TurboTax Cd to do my taxes that is unable to be completed. I tried to get my money back from Target, and because I opened the CD they wouldn't honor my refund. How can you use something in good faith and not be able to get what you purchased for and be told they can't honor it.
I purchased Turbo Tax by mail through Intuit software. I'm a 10 year customer since 1998, do renewal every year by mail, with no problems until this year. Turbo Tax Premier Edition 2009, can not install. It comes back with MS Installation problem with Turbo Tax Automatic installation. 1601 cannot Access MS Installation services. Since my computer is less than 1 year old (windows Vista Home), I contacted HP Tech Support (Compaq Presario). After 15 hours of Remote support attempting to Install both Turbo tax and attempts to fix the MS installation, they told me to contact Intuit. It was their problem. They only offered tech support online which directed me through the same problems the HP professionals could not get around. I am not alone with this Turbo tax problem; it is all over the internet with the same installation problems and there is no telephone support from Intuit Turbo Tax.
I have used TurboTax for about 14 years and it always works great. Each year, Intuit does a great job producing the best tax program there is. It is thorough, easy to use, accurate and fast. I finished my federal and state tax returns on Jan 31, 2010 and received my refunds on Feb 5, 2010. TurboTax is reasonably priced and includes a free state tax program and free e-file. I highly recommend this great tax program to everybody.
I purchased Turbo Tax on 01-28-10 from Office Max. I tried to install it and kept getting "net 3.5 framework install failed with error 1603". I went to the Turbo Tax website to resolve the issue. After spending hours trying to fix the problem, I gave up. I took Turbo Tax back to Office Max, and they refused to give my money back, but gave me another new Turbo Tax. I brought that home, tried to install it, and got the same errors. Again, I spent hours of frustration. So I boxed up Turbo Tax, and sent it back to Intuit with a receipt and a letter asking for a full refund of $53. It cost me $7.50 to send the thing back. I just went to the store and bought the competitor's product. I brought it home, and it installed perfectly! I got a free download of state tax. My taxes are done perfectly. I am a happy camper. I will never purchase Turbo Tax again, even though I have used it for the past several years. They certainly have to know there is a software program and are not addressing the issues. Now, I will wait and see if I get my money back for a busted program.
TT2009 won't load once installed. Nothing that the site says to fix works. I spent two days making adjustments trying to get to load. Once you load the software a, ".net framework" error appears. I have used Turbo Tax for years just like when they upgraded the Quicken 2009. Both are junk. Is Turbo Tax going to repair that have been caused to my computer?
I googled Turbo Tax and chose their notice for free tax filing (approved by the IRS). I started following the instructions, refusing the upgrades requiring payments, and refusing to register (record) my information. The request for money and permanent registration became more frequent and more difficult to remove from the screen. Finally it cut me off, showed me a blank screen. I don't know what became of the info I put in, I could , of course, no longer access my info (I imagine this was punishment for not playing along). I think this whole thing was a scam . I do not believe the IRS should endorse it. I am sure it is almost impossible to get through "free" as advertised. By the way, I have a PhD and do not consider myself dumber than the average citizen.
Turbo Tax misled me in my filing status on my federal income taxes for several years in a row, not allowing me to claim Head of Household status when I was eligible. This lead me to overpay my taxes. I tried to find a contact form where I could file a complaint, and it took about a half hour of searching on their website to find a way to do this (although the site tried to sell me services at every turn.) I finally filed the complaint, and received a response a week later. No apologies, just was told that I didn't qualify for their "guarantee". I am out about $1700.
Filed with TurboTax as usual. 2007 it seems was never filed according to the IRS, and the 2006 returns were sent to a bank in California. Repeated e-mails were ignored. Inquiries on their web site yielded no response. After an hour and a half holding on the phone, I finally got to talk to a person who gave me a wrong number for the bank. It was just a bookkeeping firm that helps them handle forms. Still not resolved!
This is the second year that I've tried to use TurboTax and both years, it has told me that my birthdate is incorrect (it's been the same for 43 years) and that my age from last year is wrong (taken directly from last year's return). It was funny because I got this information from the IRS after repeated rejections from TurboTax. None of their fixes worked and after 45 minutes on the phone with their technical support, I was told to return it to the store for a refund. Also, it was funny since you can't return opened software because it is a copyright infringement. The other refund process that I will have to use is my sending it back to TurboTax and waiting six weeks for the return of my $54. Never again and I encourage anyone that is planning on buying this product - don't! Also, their technical support consists of the person you are talking to emailing someone else and being put on hold endlessly. The economic impact of this is three days of my time trying to fix TurboTax's mistake, cost of sending the software back, then waiting for the refund for six weeks.
After a couple of hours loading the information, then pushing the send button it wouldn't send the files. I'm going back to pen and paper.
We have used Turbo Tax for three years with no problems. We purchased the 2009 edition and have problems with the installation. NET Framework 3.5 and a 1603 error. It doesn't matter what Turbo Tax tells you to do to fix the problem because it doesn't work! We have spent many hours all weekend trying to load it. It will be returned and I will purchase Tax Act.
I, like others, have used TT for years. I just e-filed my returns after double checking that all information was added appropriately. I then printed out the returns and fortunately looked at them. I noted that TT left one of my children out of box 6c on IRS form 1040. I checked the software again and my son was there, but not added to the proper box. I was shorted out of $465 for my federal return. I also was overcharged for state taxes by $66. Like others, I had to wait 45 minutes to get someone on the phone who took more than 40 minutes to try to help me. I have been told that I have to "mail in the box, CD, and the receipt" to get a refund. So I have to amend my return, package the TT software, travel to the post office, pay postage; and all because TT's software had a glitch! TT customer support also had the audacity to verbally challenge my reason for requesting a refund of the purchase price! They have lost my business. I am now worried if there have been past errors that their software missed. I asked Ebony if they had a database with past errors and she told me that I could use their blog or "ask Tina" for such information. I found this website while I was complaining. I printed 78 pages for nothing. I purchased software with a glitch. I have to file an amendment to the IRS and State. I now have to take time to repackage CD, pay postage, travel to post office, and then wait to see if they will respond appropriately. I am concerned that there have been other such errors that have inaccurately filed my taxes.
TurboTax insists on changing their product every year. This is tax software, not the latest operating system. Leave it alone. If it works, stop messing with it. This year (2009) TT is junk! I have had nothing but trouble with the install. People, wake up and leave it alone and stop raising the price for doing what should be free from the IRS. We should not have to pay money just to find out how much we have to pay to the IRS!
This product is terrible. I have wasted all day on trying to fix the installation problems and made two trips to the store to exchange the program, and I can't get the program to install. The support directions do not address the issue. Retailer won't refund the $50 I spent on it. I am going to send the program back to Intuit and tell them to keep it. I don't need the hassle. I want my money back! I will never buy this product again.
I have used TurboTax for the last 8 years. In uploading my final Fed and State all was well until entering the verification of line 1 on my W2. TurboTax doubled my income figures and sent them to State and Fed. So instead of a refund, it indicated I now owe $50,000 for tax. My subsequent call to TT resulted in a 40min wait on the phone for some representative to verify that my income was doubled on upload and he was sorry and I would have to now file a corrected tax form that wouldn't be available until Feb 18. He explained that there have been similar issues with others with TT, but offered no help from Intuit. On their own help site "live community", there are various posts of the same issues. Now I sit with an incorrect e-filing, my approximate refund for Fed and State of about $10k delayed for at least 3 months for re filing. I asked for a person to demand service and help with this and was given only the "President's" hot line that another 30 min wait resulted in me hanging up. I actually am considering consulting an attorney because of this snafu. Absolutely unbelievable!
For almost 2 weeks, I have gotten a "system incompatibility" message when I try to sign in to do my Turbo Tax. I have used Turbo Tax for 10 years, and this year, I think I'm switching to H&R Block! It seems as though the message has nothing to do with system incompatibility, but a problem with too many people accessing the system at once. So after taking quite sometime out of an already hectic schedule to unnecessarily update AOL, Firefox and a couple of other downloads recommended, I found that it was not my system after all but theirs. I tried one more time today just to see if I could get through but no luck so I’m taking my business elsewhere!
We have used TurboTax for several years and I have never felt that we have been prompted to receive all the deductions that they show in the commercials. They simply file the same return that you can e-file for free from the feds and charge you $30.00 or more for it. I think it is a huge ripoff. Aren't the middle class paying enough taxes as it is? Where is our "tax break" when you pay your bills and your mortgage and try to abide by the laws?
I have used Turbo Tax for years with no problems. This year the system locks when I try to click on the Continue button. I deleted the first download completely and downloaded it again. Same problem. Reading this site, it appears many others are having the same or other problems. Intuit needs to fix this immediately!
My tax refund money was deposited into Meta Bank. Meta Bank said they handled and sent out payment to my Turbo Tax card. I called the card company and got hold of a lady who was hard to understand. She said the IRS has not sent out payment yet. But if Meta Bank says they got my refund, then the card company is lying. I feel deceived by Turbo Tax.
The "Explain This" and other links do not work in the TurboTax program that I bought. They provided a work around by instructing the customer to use the Help Center in the program. However, the Help Center does not work either. No economic nor physical damage but blood pressure is going through the roof!
I use the global cash payment card. On their website they recommended to do taxes with turbo tax online, did contacted IRS after 72 hrs. They stated I should get my money by Feb 5. It didn't post to my account. Contacted both global cash company and turbo tax, they were. All they're saying that it's the IRS's fault. I'm frustrated cause I've never done my taxes online and with all the identity theft going on, I'm freaking out. Please help me.
Been a user of TT for several years with great results. This year went to install CD version and got the 3.5 framework BS! Spent 2 hours online trying to fix the problem with their support tech that said it was a system problem, not a software problem. Overall have over 4 hours invested in trying to install a program that is busted! Can't return for money back, so we are just out $50.00! Thanks Turbo Tax.
I have been purchasing Turbo Tax for over 10 plus years even using the renewal function that they want to send and charge to you in November. No problem there. I installed the Deluxe version w/ state (it reads on the CD w/state) and started my federal and taxes and when I got ready to do the state taxes, the program took me to a website to purchase the software for $39.95. I am getting no response from Turbo Tax of this problem or a solution. I am seeing all over the TT website with other users having this same problem. This is delaying me from completing my taxes and with other things that I have read about e filing from TT this year is also having issues. This scares the heck out me.
Installed Turbotax 2009 Deluxe, entered data, saved, tried to use the following day but could not activate the program. Uninstalled and reinstalled with negative results. Have used Turbotax for several years and was very satisfied with results. This year the program is the PITS.
I am trying to do my taxes, and it gets to one point and will not go on to the next page.
When I installed the program and started to print out my information, it took forever for it to get imprinted into the information box. Like I could type like a 3 year old, one finger at a time. Go get something to drink and still have to wait and I have not even reached the stages, the others having problems I have read here. I would hate to think I waited and endured this slow process just to get to the end and not have it submitted properly. No phone numbers to contact TurboTax and they want 29.99 to talk to a support representative. Are you kidding me? I will be taking my program back and look for something more dependable. If they would issue a recall and distribute CDs that work, I would go with it, but as long as they keep denying a problem or ignoring it. They will lose their bank of trusting customers. Wasted time, money for gas and patience.
TurboTax Easy stated $14.99 and then charged me $29.99 on my son's tax return. Last week, I did my return and was only charged the $14.99. Why the change and how can I contact TurboTax by phone?
Attempted to use Turbo Tax e-filing system for 2009 taxes. Wasted multiple hours with no success. Website kept re-routing me to file state return then when I gave up and proceeded to do so was informed that I would have to mail return due to some new IL tax ruling. Would not complete e-filing for federal return, just kept bouncing back into other screens. Will never use Turbo Tax again. Only good thing - didn't complete transaction and pay fee (I hope - they have all my bank account info) Waste of time and effort - 3 hours of frustration yesterday and another hour today to try to get return done e-filed.
Paid for Turbotax and downloaded software. Software would not install due to a net problem. Turbotax said to try procedures that you almost have to be a programmer to do and it still did not run. They have been sending me e-mails saying they are working on it. The last e-mail said, they will no longer update me on the problem unless I go to their website and create a new complaint. Tried to contact them concerning a refund and just get a runaround on their website with no way to actually contact anyone about a refund. And to make matters worse while trying to resolve issue, they transferred me to a website of theirs offering the same product for half of what I paid.
I clicked a link that read "Tax Act" and it brought me to TurboTax. Consumers Beware! TurboTax Basic claims to be a free online tax filing program. However, at the end of my return, it charged me nearly 1/4 of my return in "processing" fees. I paid the fees as I had already gone through the entire tax return!
I have used Turbo Tax for the last 4 years and have never had a problem. The attempt of contacting someone about this problem is endless on the phone. When you do get them on the phone (45 minutes-1 hour) later, it's really frustrating waiting all that time for nothing. I'm supposed to wait until one of their engineers designs a fix. I don't think so! I hope everyone reading this will never use Turbo Tax again. It is a big problem they will have to face sooner or later. I should have spent my 60.00 bucks of my hard earned money on formula for my 5-month-old child. The bottom line of all this is that just took away all the good everyone has had to say about Turbo Tax. Don't put your hard earned money into Intuit.
Turbo Tax will not load. I get a message saying, "missing config file #APPSHORTNAME#". I tried the Turbo Tax web site suggested fix, a "flush delete and flush install", to no avail. I spent several hours on line with their Tech Support doing the same supposed fixes to no avail and now no answers to my emails.
Have used Turbotax for years, this year it will not run, reinstalled it, checked all the sites for fixes, updates, etc. and it still won't install and run. After several attempts and some troubleshooting, others are using Intuit. They should recall all their CD versions from stores. They have a major problem. I will use a different program from now on.
I purchased TurboTax Deluxe 2009. I went through the whole process of entering my tax information. Then I went to print out the forms. The program gave me an Error Code 25013 (TurboTax was unable to install the necessary fonts.). The error message directed me to the website to get information on how to install said fonts. At the website, there were no references to that error, so no fix was available. Clicking on "Chat" gets you a message that somebody will be with you in 30 minutes. That message is followed up by an apology that their offices were closed, as they are only opened until 9:00 PM Pacific Time. Well, I called them at 7:30 PM Pacific Time. So I don't know what part of the time-space continuum they live in. They tell you they will get right back to you with an email (that seems to imply that will launch the chat). As if... From what I've read regarding the experience of other people with the 2009 version, I count my self lucky. I wasn't even able to print a copy or E-File it or anything else. And luckier yet, I bought the blasted thing at Costco. They'll be getting it back tomorrow.
The software didn't load at all on one PC. I got it to work on another and tried to change back after finally getting what I thought was a working copy. Now, it will only work for a while until a solution box comes up and opens 100+ boxes for the internet. A Wal-mart Chinese copy of Turbo Tax I presume. I'm getting my money back.
My wife and I used Turbo Tax Online in 2008. We received a confirmation as it went through. Then we received a letter from IRS asking us why we did not file our taxes. So we got on the phone to call Turbo Tax to find out what had happened. When I found what I thought was Turbo Tax office, they informed me they had nothing to do with Turbo Tax. The people I talked to had their address and telephone number on the agreement. Now my wife called them today and now they say they never got it. I have those two confirmation letters to confer to me it went through to IRS. Now we have to go to file our 2008 and our 2009 with someone else. I have learned a valuable lesson: to ensure you are getting what you have paid for happens, if you talk to the firm you are doing your taxes with.
Turbo Tax is under investigation for faulty software and for ripping off over 3,200,000 customers for over $1.8M dollars. When you file with Turbo Tax and it says your taxes are accepted, that is not always true. Out of 100 customers, 22% is received by the IRS. Their software this year has the wrong programming writing for their server and for their CDs you buy at the store or download. They will not tell you this because they have spent the budget that the company CEO and board allowed for them this year. Turbo Tax will not tell the whole truth to you, the buyer, because they don't want a lawsuit.
I have used Turbo Tax for the last 6 years and have never had a problem. This year I completed everything and performed the checks prior to e-filing it and everything was fine. No errors. I did the e-file and within 3 hours I was notified that the IRS rejected my return. All forms were wrong. It claims that numbers were missing, not enough forms were filed. It was a page worth of errors. I went through step by step two more times and tried to e-file and I received the same message. There is no economic or physical damage, just me ready to lose my mind. One of the advantages to using TT is the ability to get a tax refund within days.
It will not install because of .NET 3.5 Service Pack 1; framework installations failed with error 1603. I’m on hold two hours after trying for 5 hours to fix on my own. All I want is my money back. I'm out $50.
I have used Turbo Tax for 5 years, what is wrong with this year? I want my money back! What is going on? I have wasted money and time, already at least 5 hours of stress!
I've used TurboTax Deluxe Fed+State 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008 trouble-free and was satisfied with the software. I have the same Compaq Prisario computer since 2005, never a virus, never a problem. This year 2009, I spent $60 on TurboTax 2009 Deluxe Fed+State and suddenly it refuses to install. I get an error code 65535, their website tells me what may be wrong but covers themselves by saying this fix works most of the time but not always. I downloaded their little program to fix the supposed problem I'm having and I ran it. I reinstalled and now Error 2350. I once again downloaded another little program that will supposedly fix the problem I'm having and I ran it, reinstalled and same error. I post this info on their Support Forum Page, a tech emailed me back and said to download this third little program that will supposedly fix the problem I'm having. I ran it. Now, Error 1603. So I went to Microsoft Support page which told me to uninstall some stuff and run a fourth little program. I did so and my computer is still working perfectly. I reinstalled TurboTax. I got Error 1603 over and over and over again. I called TurboTax customer support. I was on hold for a full 45 minutes before I gave up. Fair enough, it's tax time. I went back to their forum page to see if others are having the same problem and I discovered yes indeed, many many people are having the same problem and just gave up because TurboTax Tech Support literally said to them they do not know what to do (go and read it! It's true!). So I gave up. I assume my computer is evil because Intuit cannot fix the problem. I just threw $60 out onto the street for some crow to swoop down and eat that I could have used for food or gas. So we're done with TurboTax.
I've used Turbo Tax to do our taxes for 10+ years. This year, after getting the screen of death multiple times, I was finally able to force the installation by dumping all Windows temp files, backup files (Norton Ghost), and Internet temp files. I did a literal JIG when it started working for me. Freeze, task manager here we come. It takes me to the black screen of death. Wait, it froze again after my 7 reboot after getting it to install. There is a definite problem with the software this year. I'm not sure what the issues are, but after a simple Google search, I found all the other people having issues the same as mine. Simple enough, Intuit, are you listening, your product this year is defective. Allow people to download a fixed version from your website, save your reputation while you can. Who would want to spend $60+ on software that doesn't work?
We have used Turbo Tax for 5 years with no problems. We purchased the 2009 edition and have problems with the installation. Net Framework 365 and a 1603 error. It doesn't matter what Turbo Tax tells you to do to fix the problem. It doesn't work! We have spent numerous hours--up to early AM hours--all weekend trying to load it. It will be returned and I will purchase Tax Act.
This product is not what is advertised. It says it's free, but by the time you finish to file your taxes, you have to pay more than having a tax professional do it. It's the last time I will use this product, and I will be sure my friends and others don't use it. I used TurboTax, as it says "free federal return." By the time you finish, you have to buy the basic TurboTax then pay a processing fee. The total out-of-pocket is $85. Don't advertise that it's free filing when it's not.
Just like most people reporting on this site, I have used TurboTax for many years quite happily and without any problems. But this year (2009 taxes), I could not E-file either State or Federal. That is one of the main reasons to even use TurboTax--E-file. I was on the phone (I timed it) for an unbelievable hour and 15 minutes, at the end of which, I was told that dial-up (all I have available) would not work to upload my returns. Dial-up worked to download all their huge stack of upgrades and patches, but it wouldn't upload the 6 or 8 pages of my return? They told me I would have to mail it! I was amazed and furious! To get a refund on their product, they are requiring me to ship the CD to them. I will have to wait 4-6 weeks for my Income Tax Refund (instead of the 8 days it should be). I can't wait to see how long I have to wait for a refund on their product.
I spent two hours completing tax questions. At the end, Turbo said I get refund of "zero"! No other refunds, like EIC and other. The 1099R, which I filled in according to instructions, Turbo failed to correctly process the pension above and EIC refund generated from $7704 retirement total. The 1099R should have been found in Publication 525, page 4 or general instructions found on the IRS 1040A publication (under minimum retirement age 62, which are reported on line 12a.) But with both instructions, 1099R should have been put on Line 7, taxable income on 1040A. Total, I spent four hours (two from another e-file company with same results). I already had found the rebate but used e-file to get an earlier refund. When I accepted and started the TurboTax free online, I assumed I was getting tax services from a professional tax service. Critical error by TurboTax in non-performance of a contract through the internet. No telephone number was anywhere to be found. Emails sent by me produced a general response. I have already lost two days of a refund that is critical to my living. The Publication 525, page 4, was received from an IRS representative. It’s quite evident from both tax online services that they made it impossible to reach a live party; it’s appearing you were motivated not to provide customer service, in particular the ability to find remedy by phone.
I have used Turbo Tax programs for several years and I cannot recall having problems loading a program. This year, I purchased Turbo Tax Business at Staples and installed it, but it would not open because it told me my screen was 640 over 480 pixels (a total lie). The prompt also told me to try another computer. What kind of advice is that? Then the prompt gave me the forever toll-free number to call at Turbo Tax. The prompts promised an answer within 20 minutes. I hung on for an hour and a half. I didn't even get a foreigner to pickup. I missed my deadline for getting K-1's out to my company's stockholders. They don't blame Turbo Tax, they blame me. Are the Turbo Tax discs made in that Toyota gas pedal factory in China or what?
This is not a complaint. I noticed that the vast majority of the complaints about TurboTax 2009 are associated with PC systems. I'm running TurboTax 2009 on a Macintosh (Tiger system), and I've had no problems. I had to wait for one of my state forms (3801) to be finalized, but that happened on January 21st, and everything is now complete and correct. I'm curious if other Macintosh users are having problems. I'm not, so I'm happy.
I called for repeated issues with installation. The support person had no idea what he was doing and continued to ask me for advice as to what certain terms meant on Intuit's support pages. When I asked him for specific information, he wanted to talk about cats instead. Long story short, he had me run utilities that did more harm than good. I was on hold with Intuit now waiting for support. Let's see--46 minutes so far. 10th year using their product and I’m moving on to something else. Utilities downloaded caused my computer to freeze. It is running very slow now.
I have used TurboTax for years with no problems, but this year the 2009 TurboTax has given me nothing but troubles. I was on the phone with a lady that tried to help me. She was really nice, but we could not fix the problem. What my problem is I can not get back into the work I did earlier. My computer locks up on solutions and won't do anything else. I have to go to Windows task manager and end the task before my computer will operate again. I have no problems with 2008 TurboTax. I may have to go to another tax program to do my 2009 tax. So far, I have not seen any TurboTax fixes to help me. That’s sad!
I realized last January 2009 that Turbo Tax had made an error on my 2008 return. I spent over a period of 3 days at least 15 hours on the phone. Each time we got close to the problem, I was disconnected. I emailed them, and to this date, a year later, my problem has not been resolved. Goodbye, Turbo Tax.
I purchased Turbo Tax Home and Business at Walmart just like I have the past number of years. It installs but will not open. Latonya told me (after waiting almost for 45 minutes on the phone) that it was an installation error and she could not help me. I have worked for 5 days and around 20 hours trying to get this to work. I wasted $95 dollars. Hello Tax Act.
Well, I should have taken my $24 I spent at Wal-Mart on this year’s TurboTax and flushed it down the toilet. Wow. What a total joke and rip off. I have used TurboTax for years with no problems. This is the last year they will get my money. What a shame. What a waste of my money and now going on 3 hours of time. I lost $24 and 3 hours of time trying to download the worthless CD.
After five hours of trying to install TurboTax 2009, I've given up. I downloaded updates and IE 7 and still, I can't load it due to a fatal error with .net 3.5SP1. We've used TT since 2001 and now we're done! I guess we'll be using Tax Cut.
I went to access my account online as we had used TurboTax last year for our 2009 taxes. I couldn't access my account using the correct password and security answers. After nearly 10 minutes of trying to navigate their website, I got a number and called them for technical support. What I got was a biller who was extremely rude that I would have the audacity to call their billing number for technical support. Well hello, this is the number I got. After several minutes of arguing with this person, she finally transferred me to the correct department. After a nearly 20-minute wait, I got a hold of a person, who kept trying to use my old email address. Once we figured out my email address, she couldn't access it, but the automated system had no issue sending a message that they resolved the issue (not). Forty-five minutes instead of the five-to-10 it should have to access my account. -
I have been using TurboTax since 1996 and never had any installation problems. This year, the 2009 version requires an additional installation of "NET Framework 3.5 SP1" which does not install. I keep getting an error code 1603 message and all of the suggested fixes do not work. Spent 25 minutes on hold before a service tech got on the line. Spent another 1-1/2 hours trying to correct the error code 1603. Nothing worked, so the below email from TurboTax is how it all ended. TurboTax 2009 Deluxe w/ state is a defective product as I see so many others with the same problem on this website. Thank you for contacting TurboTax Help and Support. You called requesting assistance regarding the following issue: 1603. These are the actions we took to assist you in resolving your issue: I'm sorry we couldn't resolve your issue today. You can contact our Satisfaction Guarantee website and talk to them about a refund if you cannot get a refund at establishment you bought our product at.
I have used Turbo Tax for the past 2 years! This year I filed efile and it said 8-14 days for my return to be deposited. This was a big lie! Now they are saying at the earliest Feb. 9th. This is 24 days not 8-14! I will never use Turbo Tax again. I'm very unhappy. When I called in to ask why, I was told they can't explain and don't know why it was like that! I am behind on my bills and have told the collectors that I would have payments by Jan. 29th and now I have to call and see if they can work with me all because of Turbo Tax.
I paid $50 for software that will not download because of .net 3.5 framework. Tech support said there are lots of complaints about this but could not help. It sounds like Turbo Tax 2009 software has a problem this year, from the Tech
I tried to file by Turbo Tax online. When comparing to the IRS free forms, Turbo Tax says that I will get a refund that is $309 more than what the IRS says. When I viewed my forms, Turbo Tax shows that I paid $309 more in taxes than my W2. When I tried to find out why, I got, ”I do not understand the question.” Or, “Do you need a W2?” I was trying to use Turbo Tax for a faster refund since the IRS free form/free file has a problem with form 8283. I will mail it in.
I got a Turbo Tax disc in the mail. I tried to install, it wouldn't work. I called the help number and they said I had to pay and they would give me a number to key in when I load the disc. I gave them my card number, they gave me a number and the disc still wouldn't work. I called the help line for Turbo and spoke to Andrea. She uploaded the Turbo for free and said that I would be reimbursed. She also gave me an incident number. One day later, I was charged on my account again. I had to move money so that I would not go into overdraft because of these charges. I called again and spoke to someone named Suryia or something foreign. After another 2 hours dealing with her, she assured me that both charges would be taken off. As of today, there are still 2 charges of $ 63.55 each ($127.10 total). I am afraid to look again for fear that 3 charges will be out there. Turbo is a good program but customer service is very, very bad. People who can barely speak English can't to help you and cannot even spell correctly. I had to move money from savings to cover these fees.
After having spent the last two days trying to download Turbo Tax 2009, I finally gave up and contacted them for the address to return it. I ended up speaking to a man that barely spoke English but I got the address and will be getting a full refund. Goodbye, Turbo Tax. Hello H & R Block.
I purchased Turbo Tax; everything was going great until I got to the e-filing step that is when everything went wrong. My federal return was accepted, but when I tried filing my state returns, a message popped up saying I needed to mail my state returns. It did not give me a reason for that. When I purchased Turbo Tax, I bought the Deluxe, because on the box it said state filing was included. To my surprise, I can't e-file my state return, instead I have to mail them in and wait forever and a day to get my money I so badly need. I tried calling Turbo Tax, but I was on hold for over thirty minutes. I just do not have the time to wait on the line. So I tried doing the chat, but that did not work either. I am just so unhappy with Turbo Tax. I will never buy it again.
I purchased TurboTax this year (as I have for the past ten years) and discovered that there is an error with the program if you are running on Windows Vista. The program took about one hour to install (from a CD) and when I started entering my taxes, it took another 15 minutes. After I was done, I tried to el-file and discovered that the submission process does not work. I researched for 3 days and got many different answers. The TurboTax support instructs you to check the firewalls, check your virus software, and reset your internet browser among many other things that do not work. I logged a problem using their online support but that was not working either. I lost connection about 5 times until it finally lost it for good. I called and after 45 minutes of waiting, I spoke to a technician who was not very knowledgeable. He referred me to Microsoft, which is another nightmare. I finally discovered that you cannot process the submission if you are running Windows Vista and have Internet Explorer 8.0. You have to have Windows XP and running Internet Explorer 6.0 or 7.0. This is obviously a TurboTax programming problem which they need to fix. IE has been out for a long time now and they should make their program compatible. I got my taxes done using Windows XP and IE 7.0 and it took less than one minute to upload. This took many hours of research, causing frustration and stress.
We purchased TurboTax online as we have for many years. This year, they charged my credit card three times. We were on the phone for 30 minutes trying to get it resolved with someone who did not speak English. We spend a lot of time trying to get a credit issued, but finally we did.
I used TurboTax in 2008 and thought my taxes were done correctly. In December of 2009, my husband and I got a letter from IRS stating we owed $536.00 as we did not claim his unemployment. I did place the unemployment as form 1099-G. I contacted TurboTax and they are trying to say I had 4 choices on the 2008 tax form and chose "state and local refund" instead of unemployment. I did not have these choices and was prompted to enter the 1099-G form and the amount. I bought a new computer after doing the taxes. Still have the old one, I just have to retrieve the information. I know I entered the information correctly.
My husband and I have been using TurboTax for many years. This year, like every year, we filed for federal and state taxes. TurboTax accepted them and we later got an email saying that they both were rejected. We thought, "Oh, well TurboTax will just walk us through it and whatever was incorrect will be fixed." That is not the case. They showed us a page that says, "Let’s look at your return." Basically it is 27 lines of tax speak. You can't file page 1 of Form 8608 without filing page 2 and 3. You need to only file page 3 of Form 1040 for State Taxes and not pages 1 and 2. Well, we weren't the ones that sent the papers to the federal and state governments. How are we supposed to fix sending different forms? There is no way to choose what gets e-filed and what doesn't! Their customer service is non-existent and we are truly stuck with a bunch of forms that no one will accept. We now have to go through everything with a fine tooth comb and most likely pay another source to help us file our taxes. Taxes are a big deal. You don't get "do-overs" with the government. TurboTax should totally revamp their whole customer service relations program. We are using TaxAct from now on.
We purchased the 2009 edition, only to find that there is a programming error for Windows. I spent 4 hours trying to download it, another 45mins on hold w/ TurboTax and 1hr w/ a service rep that eventually told me there is an error in the program and they didn't know when it would be fixed. I spoke w/ another customer service person today and she hung up on me. Wal-Mart, where it was purchased, would only exchange it for another one which doesn't help since it is defective to start with. Guess, we got took but it won't happen again. Goodbye TurboTax.
I have been trying to file my taxes using Turbo, as I do every year. I am using OS Windows XP and Internet Explorer 8, yet when I try to sign in, it always takes me to the "system compatibility" page. When I tried to use their online chat help, the rep, Patricia **, would not listen to what I was telling her and eventually disconnected me. I still cannot log in. Guess I'll try H&R Block or TaxAct.com. Too bad, Turbo Tax. I was a good customer!
I have attempted numerous times via phone and email to contact anyone with this company to request a refund. I purchased by (credit card) the Premier Turbo Tax 2009 for $89.95, I never downloaded it due to finding the same version for $49.95 online. I processed my 2009 (Turbo Tax) taxes online and chose to have them deduct the $49.95 out of my refund. The attempt of contacting someone has been exhausting and extremely frustrating. I am requesting a refund of $89.95 and was given an incident #** for reference. The receptionist put me on hold as soon as I entered the incident number and she never returned to assist me. I attempted numerous times to call back and every time was put on hold. I have been a repeat customer for years and with this unsatisfactory service, I will no longer be a customer and ensure that I tell all my friends and family of this incident.
I have been using TurboTax since 1998 and never had any installation problems. This year, the 2009 version requires an additional installation of "NET Framework 3.5 SP1" which does not install. I keep getting an error code 1603 message and all of the suggested fixes do not work. Intuit has a defective product with the 2009 TurboTax program and they will lose thousands of customers like me if they do not fix this problem soon. Unable to file tax returns early will cost time and money to change to a new e-file program.
I paid to use Turbo Tax this year so it would directly import our W2, plus it imported our info from last year's free version. All our info was super simple (I have severe arthritis, so the $20 was worth it to save typing). Our federal was rejected because Turbo Tax imported our youngest child's DOB as 1998, making him born 3 months prior to our oldest child. I realize this isn't a major big deal to some, but we need our refund and this was a major hassle. It took 3 times of manually fixing it before Turbo Tax would save the info properly and re-eFile.
Like Phil of Peabody, MA on your website, TurboTax 2009 will not install. There is some type of problem involving the Windows .NET Framework. The initial suggested fix of reloading .NET 3.5 SP1, it doesn't work neither, do several intricate steps suggested on their website to which I was referred. I'm supposed to wait until one of their engineers designs a fix. I've waited 3 days. Meanwhile, they've taken my money and are not providing the promised program in a usable format. I cannot file my tax returns in a timely manner. I've used Turbo Tax for nearly a decade. Never had a problem before. I bet thousands are in the same boat.
I have used turbo tax for 9 years now. Never having a problem. This year 2009, I can't seem to get onto the program. It wants to install SP1 and it says that my computer does not have the updates required. What! What is this all about? Then when trying to get customer service, can't. Won't happen and if you try to use the "chat" method, you have to use their problems and their verbiage. Useless. Goodbye turbo tax. There are less complicated e-filing methods out there like thru the IRS. Thanks for nothing.
Turbo Tax will not do my two daughter's college expenses correctly. It keeps insisting that I come out better off to use the tuition and fees deduction (and it only gives me a $2000 deduction, it should be twice that) and not the American Opportunity Credit. It will not even give me a place to try to use the credit. This is totally wrong. Turbo Tax had me owing $2000+ federal. I went to Tax Slayer and they figured it correctly and now I get a refund of $2000. I now realize Turbo Tax did this to me last year, 2008, too. I will be filing an amended return for 2008 and will never use Turbo Tax again!
TurboTax 2009 is a complete bust this year and their support to fix problems is invisible. This year's version requires an additional installation first to your computer (Net 3.5 SP1) which does not work. Their online and phone center support are useless. In the end, they ask you to create an error file and email it to Intuit for resolution and Intuit is not responding either. This company has a defective product and is not responding to any resolutions. I am currently using a tech service at plus $50 an hour to get the program installed and the tech company is having problems as well. After 4 hours, the program is still not installed when it took a mere 10 minutes in past years. Their installation platform is flawed.
Their product calculated my 2006 NC state return incorrectly and I had to pay a penalty and back taxes. The penalty was less than $50 but Intuit would not refund the penalty. NC Department of Rev said that many returns by Turbo Tax had made this error in calculating tax due. It is very difficult filing a claim using Turbo Tax website and they are not helpful. They do not stand by their claim to pay they penalties.
I was downloading TurboTax 2009 from a CD when a pop-up window informed me that I needed Microsoft NET 3.5 SP1 installed to use the software. The program proceeded to download NET 3.5 and install it. A reboot was required but afterward my computer would not boot up at all. All I get is a black screen when I turn the computer on. Even safe mode is inaccessible.
I tried to file my retirement tax with no earned income and turbo would not except and complete the return, so I could email it.
I received a notice from IRS that I had entered a "federal withholding" amount double the actual amount. I had filed electronically and didn't have a complete printout of my return. This year, I will not e-file. I will mail my return and double check with the tax tables manually. I had received a refund and after tax, penalties and interest, I paid much more to IRS than I had received. I had the cash to pay immediately, but I regret having to pay more than I owe.
I am unable to make purchase for download of 2009 TurboTax Deluxe and there was no help available. I got a few hours of wasted time at my rates of more or less $300 per hour.
There's an issue with my 2008 taxes and it was not my error. IRS is advising that we owe $15000. It was $10000 but interested added. They are taking $100 a month out of my account already and all my taxes were paid. I filed through Intuit Turbo Tax. IRS sent something about unreported income that was the exact amount of money my husband made and we reported for 2008 but a different EIN for some website company. My husband's a massage therapist. Have we been robbed? We have tried to get this resolved and thought it was, but apparently not. Now I am going to spend more money that I don't have to get this fixed. Where did my money go? I am already facing foreclosure of my house and a pregnant 17-year-old daughter and now I have to deal with this?
I received a letter from the State Tax Commission stating that there was an "Adjustment of Individual Income Tax Refund" to my 2008 return. The taxable income that the State Tax Commission computed were different from my Turbo Tax numbers. I entered all the numbers from appropriate forms correctly and I don't understand the reduction in my expected tax refund amount. I emailed my complaint about the discrepancies and hoped for the stated 100% accuracy guarantee that Turbo Tax boasts. As a result, I only received an email response from Turbo Tax stating that the Accuracy Guarantee is a reimbursement program covering penalties and/or interest only. I was financially devastated as a result of Turbo Tax's incorrect calculations. Consequently, I lost my apartment and fell behind on my bills. I will be interested in joining a class action lawsuit against Turbo Tax as I feel they are not honoring their advertised policy.
I filed my returns for 2007 with no issue, but I just received a bill from the IRS stating that I owe an additional $1544 in taxes for my 2008 Federal return. I showed I entered all of my w-2 information and TurboTax used the right wage figure for my State return but used a figure $9999 less for my Federal return. I have tried everything just to get a phone number for customer service but feel like TurboTax gives customers the runaround and makes it very difficult for customers to get any resolutions. My return have printed right on it 100% guarantee and that they will pay for errors but good luck getting it.
I also received a notice from the IRS last week stating that we had incorrectly claimed too much for our federal withholding in 2007. Not true. I have my documentation. Amounts I entered were correct. Amount TurboTax reported was higher. A $635 difference in tax is costing us over $3500 in taxes, penalties and interest. And they want it now! I have always used TurboTax but won't this year. I, too, would be interested in joining a class action suit. We will have to prematurely take money out of our retirement fund and pay a penalty and increase our tax due this year or pay it out to the IRS and be out even more in interest than they already want.
I have used TurboTax for many years and have been satisfied until now. There is a recent problem I ran into in that TurboTax does not save worksheets and include them with your PDF copy filed with the IRS. I tried to access my 2008 return worksheet documenting 1099s that I reported, and TurboTax said they could not produce it. Unbelievable. This is the worksheet document that details 1099s that were reported to IRS as part of my income. My return is not complicated, and I know the amount of gross receipts includes all my 1099s. I know I am accurate; however, I need the document to prove to IRS. It is a worksheet with only one or two pages at the most. For TurboTax not to save this and make it readily available, there is something very wrong and/or very suspicious here. This is a critical document that verifies specific amounts and sources of income reported to IRS.What gives? Someone vested in law, please look into this.
I filed 2007 taxes with TurboTax. I received notice from IRS that withholding amount was entered incorrectly and now owe over $3900 in taxes, penalties and interest. TurboTax states they cannot find the error. Everything was entered correctly. They refused to assist. I now have to pay over $3900 due to an error in the TurboTax system. I would be interested in joining a class action suit.
I filed my 2007 taxes with TurboTax. I received a bill a year later for more than $17,000. I had purchased the tax audit service through TurboTax. They asked me to submit several documents, which I did. I was told through tax audit that it was my fault because I made an error with respect to how we recorded the interest paid on one of our properties. We thought that TurboTax would be able to catch such errors. We were shocked to find that it could not. We were also told that we were not allowed to claim the full amount for money spent on renovations to our rental property. Yet, TurboTax added them up as if we could. We were severely penalized by the IRS for this, too. As a result, we are entering into financial ruin. We need some relief. We have a tax bill of $18,000 that we cannot afford to pay on our limited income. The IRS is threatening to garnish our wages and put a lien against our property. We need serious help!
My husband and I used TurboTax in 2007 to do our taxes. We received a letter from the IRS this summer saying that we had state federal withdrawal amount was more than it actually was. My husband remembers going through this problem with TurboTax. We had sold some stock through his stock options. The company paid the taxes and included the amount as part of his withheld amount. However, TurboTax kept asking us to put in a figure for the withheld tax, thereby causing us to list the withheld amount a second time. Now the IRS is asking us to pay the difference plus penalties and interest for two years. The difference was only a couple of hundred dollars but it amounts to over $2400 due now! Does anyone know anything about a lawsuit? In talking to my brother, the same thing happened to him for the same tax year! That can't be a coincidence! We owe over $2400 to the IRS. It will actually turn out to be more because we can't pay it all at once. We actually have to make payments which will accrue more interest and penalties on the balance.
I purchased TurboTax online for 2008. They take your 2008 files offline on Oct 21st. Now, I need to access them and the only answer I can get from TurboTax is I have to buy the CD version of 2008. I thought I already bought TurboTax. Why am I required to purchase it again to access my 2008 taxes? Seems like extortion to me. I have used TurboTax for 10 years. I will not use them again.
I have used TurboTax for about 5 years and have always been happy not to have to read through complicated tax instructions, but instead to have to answer much simpler questions as prompted by TurboTax until now. I received a notification from the IRS that itemized deductions on my 2007 return exceeded limits for those above certain AGI levels and I now owe back taxes with penalty and interest. I decided to see if there were others who have had similar problems with TurboTax 2007, which brought me to this website. This is very eye-opening. I have not yet tried to contact TurboTax, but how can they not be responsible for errors with their product? Does anyone know if there is a lawsuit against them? If not, I for one think that there should be!
I had filed an extension and then on October 14th, I filed my tax form using TurboTax. IRS rejected my form. TurboTax instructed me to go into my form, check the reasons for the rejection and then TurboTax would help me fix it. I followed the instructions to find that the 2008 tax forms are not available until around Nov 2nd because they are getting ready for the 2009 tax year. I paid the deluxe price for TurboTax and now cannot retrieve my 2008 tax form nor get any other support to help with the problems. I am extremely upset with the company for being so inconsiderate to their customers. I will have to pay a penalty because the tax form will be late.
I was contacted by the Office of the President about my complaint which I filed with the BBB. They sent me the desktop version of TurboTax 2007, which did my taxes correctly. The online version did not put my military retirement into line 16b (taxable) so I got a bill from the IRS. I told the guy (Mark) that there was an issue with the online version. I receive an email today 10/20/2009 that they are taking the online version offline and that they can't duplicate the problem with the desktop version. The IRS sent me a bill for $6500.00. TurboTax knows there is a problem with the online version of the software and has taken it offline.
I used TurboTax online deluxe to file my 2007 taxes. After entering my 1099-R for my military retirement income, the program asked me if this was a Non-Qualified distribution if it met any of 3 categories, one being a payment from a military retirement. I answered yes. The program put the amount in line 16a but not 16b. I received a bill from the IRS for $6,500.00 plus additional interest. I called TurboTax. The first person I talked to Autumn said it appeared the software had made an error, but she didn't know why. She sent me the 2007 software to redo my taxes. The next guy I talked to Dave said it was my problem. "I must have entered something wrong." Is there a pending lawsuit against TurboTax? If so, please include me. If not, how do I start one?
I could not figure why the IRS and now the California Franchise board are slapping me with back taxes and penalties. I already paid the IRS, but upon examination of the Form 1040, it turned out that even though the information was correctly entered in the TurboTax drop-down menus, not all data were transferred to the 1040. I have emailed Intuit, but all I can do at this time is await their reply. Now, I have several thousand dollars in IRS and state penalties and likely a red flag next to our name.
TurboTax omitted some of our 2008 taxable income. My husband and I have received at penalty in the amount of $1,300. I checked our W-2's and the amounts were entered correctly. Intuit is impossible to reach.
I filed my retired parent's tax return for 2007 using Turbo Tax Deluxe. I just received a notification from the IRS that we owe an additional $1365 plus interest. Turbo Tax did not add in their retirement income (even though it was entered) as taxable income! I decided to see if other people have had the same problem on your site, they have! So I will not contact Intuit as it looks like they do not respond favorably to consumers. I've used them for many years, but am really contemplating not to use them any longer if they don't stand by their product.
I have recieved an email from this company to file my taxes. I'm a student, and I have never filed taxes. They also have a faulty address on file. I can't get a hold of them due to the fact that they don't have a phone number.
Not so much a complaint as a question. I tried asking a question or finding support at Intuit, but no luck so I ended up here. The question is how could I get spam (phishing) regarding my tax filing on the day of filing and the two following days? Is my information on TurboTax compromised? It seems like more than a coincidence, since this is not the tax filing season. On each of the days in question, I sent to or received email from Intuit. Apparently, the return is at IRS, as I got a response when I went to irs.gov and clicked on where is my refund. I am currently worried about my personal information.
We filed our 2007 tax return with TurboTax. I added my husband's retirement income, but for some reason, TurboTax did not add it as a taxable income. We now owe IRS because of this mistake from TurboTax. We will not be using it again, and we will tell friends about it if TurboTax doesn't do anything to correct their mistakes.
When using TurboTax to file my 2007 and 2008 tax returns, one of the questions asks, "Do you pay alimony/child support?" I replied, "Yes" and entered the $12000 that I pay per year child support. I have just been audited by the IRS reflecting that I owe an additional $3000 for the 2007 tax year because child support is not tax deductible, only alimony. Why does the program prompt you to enter child support payments if it's not relevant? I am not a tax expert and put my faith in this program as my filings are always straight-forward and, up to this point, uncomplicated. The mistake and audit check function of the program returned no errors or warnings. $3000 owed from the 2007 tax year, and I am assuming at least another $3000 from the 2008 tax year when that catches up with me. I am divorced with an increased mortgage payment to cover my ex-wife's share of the equity in the house, plus $1000 a month in child support stacked on top of every day living expenses. My oldest son, who is disabled and unemployed, resides with me which has increased my monthly utility bills. I don't have that amount of money to just write a check for this type of unexpected burden.
I filed my daughter's 2007 taxes using Turbo Tax Premier because of stock options. An audit by the IRS stated that the withholding was overstated and was issuing a bill of $1600.00. When I inquired at Turbo Tax, I was told that it was an error on my part. Later, I found out that while I submitted the Premier eFile, I was told by Turbo Tax that the Deluxe was submitted. When I asked for a copy, I was told it wasn't there. I ended up with a refund for the Deluxe. The last person I talked to could not explain how the situation occurred but he was sorry. Turbo Tax correctly placed the stock compensation with the gross income, but it failed to correctly place the withholding in the Federal withheld which caused the overstated amount of the withholding. I have been in contact with the Tax Advocate, which delayed the IRS since March of 2009. In July, I filed with the attorney general about this situation. Currently, my daughter is not working and unemployment benefits had ran out including extensions. IRS has not filed a final bill as of yet to take action. I've found an attorney for low-income families where they will be able to assist with the situation.
I was audited by the IRS for my TurboTax 2007 return. The result was approximately $3300 in penalties and interest. The specific problem was that the TurboTax product asked for and accepted 1098 mortgage interest twice in its program, doubling the mortgage interest that was reported on my taxes. I have screen shots of the software to show how this happened, and the vice-president of TurboTax has stated that the program worked as designed and that checking for duplicate entries after they specifically asked for it twice was "not a priority" for Intuit. I have tried to resolve this myself with B. Meighan, but he has told me 1) the programming issue wasn't a priority for his team and that 2) I should ask the IRS to waive the penalty because I used TurboTax. I find both of these responses to be amazing, given the "Accuracy Guarantee" and "Audit Support" touted by Intuit. Clearly, the consumer is on their own to know everything there is to know about IRS rules and cannot trust that TurboTax is asking the right questions and taking responsibility when they don't. I would like an attorney to contact me. I'm curious to know if a class action suit is in order. I have full documentation of all emails between the TurboTax VP and myself, and I will share them. I have approximately $3300 in penalties and taxes and additional $11,000 in taxes now owed that I will have to borrow from the IRS at 5% in order to fulfill my surprise tax obligation.
I go to file using TurboTax software in 2008 for 2007 tax year as I have done the last 5 years. A little man pop up saying that I could receive more if I filed the alternative minimum tax way. I clicked to do it and offered a large increase. I think it may be a mistake and go to file the normal way and he pops up again. I do file, not understanding it, but I trust TurboTax is accurate and knows the law. The IRS contacts me and says that tax was disallowed. I contacted TurboTax and stated why I file that way is because of the software and I believe they will stand behind their 100% accuracy guarantee. Recently, Taya, who was handling the case, sent an email stated that she was looking into the matter and would contact me if any other info was needed. Jason, who I had no contact with, contacted me 9 minutes later and stated that my claim was disapproved. I would never have even attempted to file the alternative minimum way if not for the software and trust I had in it being accurate. Secondly, the error only occurred when I attempted to file the alternative minimum way. When I filed the normal way, all my info stayed the same. Only after the IRS contacted did I realize that TurboTax was changing the numbers incorrectly and until then. I hadn't even looked at them to see exactly what or how TurboTax was changing the numbers.
TurboTax filed my out of state taxes and didn't file my state or Federal taxes. They say I made a mistake somewhere, but I got all the way through and was told that they were being filed. When I went to find out where my refund was, I found out they were never filed.
The IRS found a mistake that TurboTax did not, and I need to speak to someone at TurboTax to see how they plan to fix this issue. The IRS now expects me to pay for the mistake with interest. I expect to hear from someone in the next 48 hours.
I purchase TurboTax software for $93 in April 2009, after checking other software programs. This one guaranteed the highest refund, but to do this, they added a $600 rebate credit to line 42 on my taxes without asking if I received this money costing me to pay $225 to IRS. When I e-mailed them with the problem, they simply said "we don't give refunds on e-filings". Late fees for filing taxes and an additional $225 paid to IRS.
I received a notice from Colorado that I had entered on Line 26 on Form 104 of the Colorado return an entry of $179.00. Colorado states the estimated tax credit you claimed on this line is greater than the estimated tax payment we received. When I viewed my tax data from the tools menu, line 26 is not listed but the carryover weeks line shows the 2004 state tax refund overpayment and applied amount to be $179.00, which is correct. I spoke with a support person about this and she walked me through the process to view the data I had entered. I did not enter the line 26 amount ($179.00) on my return. She said my tax data file shows only the information that I had input when asked by the program. Line 26 on Colorado Tax Form 104 states, "Estimated tax payments and credits, extension payments and amounts withheld on non-resident real estate sales and partnerships/S corp/ fiduciary income." I did not enter the $179 that is listed on the form. I did not sell any real estate and did not have anything to enter on this line and was not even asked to. The Turbo Tax program only asked me to enter the 2004 state refund amount, which happens to be $179. I contacted the Turbo Tax tax analysts per the instructions I received from the Intuit Accuracy Guarantee email. I explained all of this to Taya ** and she stated that I was prompted to allow the $179 to be imported from the 2004 tax refund line on the 2005 Federal 1040 form, which I answered yes to. She claimed I was prompted twice for this same amount, but she provided me a snapshot of my return only prompting me to import the refund amount. I asked her for the second prompt screenshot, but she would not provide it. She instead wanted a phone meeting to explain why she was right. I emailed her with five internet sites that all complain of her product and that talking with her would go nowhere. She replied to me, "My determination on your claim is final." I asked her why both lines contained $179 and that I had only entered this amount once. She did not answer this question. The My Tax Data file clearly shows that I did not enter line 26. I had to pay the State of Colorado $241, which included interest. My wife and I are both unemployed so getting this money together was very difficult. I was treated like I was stupid. I have been in the IT field for 25 years and have studied C+ and other types of programming. I feel I was shot down right from the start. Thank you.
We received a penalty from the IRS for underreporting 2007 annuity income. Upon checking everything, we discovered that the TurboTax program mishandles the second annuity when both the filer and spouse receive annuities. We filed a claim under TurboTax’s "Accuracy Guarantee". I spent 1/2 hour on the phone with a technical service rep, who took control of my PC and was able to see where the problem was, and said we'd get the penalty paid by TurboTax. However, we've since been stonewalled by the programmers or tax analysts who insist, "We received claims in the past about this before and it has always proven not to be a calculation error." Further, they said, "The person that you spoke with was not an analyst, but a technical support agent," implying that the problem was never referred for programming correction. Bottom line, in their defensive posture, they are not listening. It is not the first annuity that has the error, it is the second one. I've asked to have this complaint escalated to a manager and it remains to be seen if I'll get a response.
SBBT has not sent my refund back. I desperately need this money. I will not use TurboTax next year. They stole my money.
I used TurboTax Deluxe Edition to prepare my 2007 Federal Tax filing. I recently received a notice from the IRS that I had deducted interest from my home mortgage in excess of the allowed limit. I entered all of my information into TurboTax and it calculated the interested allowed. The whole point in using TurboTax is that I don't have to study the tax laws and double check their calculations. Mortgage interest is one of the most common (and significant) deductions and the software should have made the calculation. I now owe an additional $9,000 in Federal taxes for 2007 and I am being charge interest (included in the amount).
I e-filed my taxes back in March 22, 2009. As of May 1st, I hadn't received my refund. I called the IRS and was told that indeed I have filed my taxes but there was no refund in their system. I was told to e-file again, so I did. As of today, June 8th, 2009, I have not received my refund. I called the IRS again and was told that the problem is with Turbo Tax and I had to contact them for my refund. There is no customer service phone number where to reach them other than the customer service where you pay to get your questions answered. I definitely don't want to pay $29.99 just to get my questions answered if they were the ones who messed up my refund! I'm mad!
I have used TurboTax several years, except right after my husband died. Because I wanted to be correct, I used a CPA. This year, I went back to TurboTax and was doing well until they insisted that I fill out Form 1310. My husband has been dead for over 3 years. The income I reported had nothing to do with him, and because of this, it said I was unable to e-file. I never received confirmation, so I sent it by mail, but I had to send an amended return. As of today, 6-7-09, I still have not received my refund. I called the IRS and was told it could be another month. This is outrageous! I need new hearing aids and was going to use the money to help buy them.
I filed via Internet, emailed and got a confirmation number. Months later, when I contacted the IRS to find out the status of my refund, I was told the Income Tax Return filed had not reached them - they had no record of it. I emailed Intuit TurboTax to inquire about it but two weeks later, I still have not heard anything from them.
I used the Deluxe TurboTax Federal and State e-file software to prepare my 2008 individual tax returns. Due to the handling and reporting requirement of the new Economic Recovery Rebate this year, my federal e-file return has been rejected and unfixable within their "fix" process. I have received my state income tax refund, but federal refund due to be refunded to me is being held up at this point. So much for efficiency of e-filing. As I see it, Intuit and TurboTax have a problem product here without an easy fix. The federal income tax refund that is due to me is not in my hands. It won't happen again next year if I file my returns manually. Thanks for your space here.
The 2008 TurboTax Deluxe Critique package is the most crude, primitive one I've seen in a long time. It has innumerable annoying factors which need not occur in well-designed software. It also lacks some apps for particular tax programs. The Massachusetts top form includes a line for the Senior Circuit-Breaker deduction, but the program provides no way to calculate it! When going to a group of programs at the bottom of the list, then displaying one, it displays at 100% size, which is inconvenient, so I lower it to 75%. If I then return to the list, it pops up top-justified and I have to scroll down again to the lower group. If I then open another one, it comes up at 100% and has to be reduced. Ad nauseam! That's dumb design. I've been warned of a super-virus expected. Why can I not copy my TurboTax files to a thumb-drive? It seems not to permit that. Some files are labeled keep for your records, others are simply worksheets. The worksheets contain data that support inputs. Shouldn't they be mailed? There are no explicit instructions as to what should be submitted. Before doing half of the data input, TurboTax claimed to have filed! Actually, it did not but that didn't prevent it from claiming to submit a disruptive (incomplete) form, followed by a useless 1040X. The Feds, in an unexpected position, did not create last minute changes to the tax code. But this did not stop TurboTax from making many last minute changes, suggesting that they just did a careless job of coding. A lot of downloads size up your system to see if they're needed. TurboTax is too dumb to do that, so it always prompts to download even if it's redundant. TurboTax prompted me to e-file, but a few screens later said that it could not! The worksheet for 1099R has a lot of boiler plate up front, which has to be entered for every item, not providing any automatic fill in at all. Even Microsoft does better than this, and VMS did much better 20 years ago.
I prepared both federal and state taxes using 2007 Turbo Tax (paid extra to get state taxes on my computer). Turbo Tax automatically transferred everything from federal to state form on my program. I only answered a few simple questions to finish my state return. Turbo Tax transferred my moving expenses from federal and also calculated our income wrong. I filed a complaint to get our penalties and interest back from Turbo Tax, received a phone call that it all was our errors, that we manually entered items wrong. What a joke that company is, anything to get out of the guarantee you supposedly provide to customers! The person that called me back sounded to be around 90 years old! No wonder! I will never purchase this software again!
TurboTax charged me for TurboTax Premier even though I filed using TurboTax Deluxe and continue to have TurboTax Deluxe. The customer service representative I spoke with agreed I had purchased Premier even though my account reflects Deluxe. I have one account, one ID, I have been using with TurboTax for the past 4 years. When I asked the customer service representative to connect me to his supervisor, he said he could not connect me nor correct this mistake. He repeated he could not give me a refund for the previous erroneous purchase nor upgrade me to Premier. I have spent an additional $25 for a service I did not use. I have not been compensated for this mistake and am frustrated over having to stay on the phone for 1 hour without being connected to a supervisor and for no assistance whatsoever.
I first called Turbo Tax on March 19 about improper handling of accrued interest in the home and business version. I have used Turbo Tax for more than 10 years and never had a problem before. The system does not allow more accrued interest than the interest reported in Box 1 and Box 3 of the 1099INT. From a tax and investment point of view, there is no relationship between accrued and earned interest on the 1099INT, and the system should not be doing the edit. This is something that used to work properly in earlier versions. The rep kept calling it incurred interest. The supervisor that I asked for was worse than useless in understanding the problem. After 45 minutes of my precious time, I gave up and asked that they call me back when they solved the problem. I had to call again the weekend before April 15 as there was still not a fix in the update files. I finally had to do the Schedule B myself, overriding the error showing in the system. Because of the override, I could not use the online submission which was supposed to be free.
I started with the "Deluxe" program. I tried to complete a simple stock sale and was prompted "you need to use the Premier version." I paid for the upgrade just so I could enter a loss of just over $200. When I tried to e-file, Turbo Tax would not accept my email confirmation. Trying to get help? What a joke! I go to the "Call Us" site, tried to describe my email problem and all I got was an error message when I try to send the question. For the price of gas to go to the nearest IRS office, I could have finished my return on 4/15/09. They want you to "Ask the Community." I didn't pay over $100 to get a 3rd opinion.
I bought TurboTax Deluxe from Costco (PC version). It took me one week to enter all my tax information (W-2s, stocks, interests, deductions, etc). I e-filed the return to IRS. I needed to amend the return but I couldn't find it. It appears that the return has disappeared from my PC (I have not deleted any file and my recycle bin has not been cleared in the last one month). It's probably some bug in their software but they don't acknowledge it. I called customer service twice (long time on hold) but there was no resolution. They could not find the tax file. They did not have any means to retrieve data from IRS or any utility to re-create the tax file from the PDF version of the return. The customer service behavior was not sympathetic.
I went to TurboTax online to fill out my free Federal Income Tax Form. When I got to the end, it said I had 6 mistakes that needed to be corrected. I went back and the computer kept asking me for my employer's name. I am on disability and do not work. I have a 1099, not a W-2. I spent a good three hours trying to figure out what I did wrong. I finally decided to print my return and finish it by hand. Of course, I had to pay first. I paid and the site would not print my signature pages. I went round and round and my computer kept freezing up, telling me to put in my employer's zip code, address and ID number. I finally unplugged my computer as I was mad as hell. After I calmed down, I plugged it back in and decided to start over. By this time, I had received my state paperwork but not my federal. The only way I could get this website to work was to click on E-file both state and federal. They tell you that it's $29.95 for Federal and $39.95 for both. So I thought, "What the hell? I can't stand this torture anymore." Today I checked my bank statement and TurboTax charged me twice. I was so mad I called them and the foreigner I got on the phone couldn't understand anything I was telling him. He refused to credit my account and he refused to let me speak with a supervisor. These guys are crooks and I hope someone puts a stop to this ripoff of a company. They must be making billions on their free income tax filings.
I went through the process of filing my taxes when it came time to pay I did with a credit card. This was prior to complete filing, then I tried to e-file and it wouldn't let me. I should not have been charged first. I had to totally redo all with another program. I want my money credited back to my credit card. They did nothing for me except frustrate me and waste my time and I had to pay for it.
They advertise Free Tax filing. They say get started for free. I chose the free option and was charged $49.95 for the preparation of my Federal Tax Return. I was also charged $39.95 for filing my State Return. The $39.95 they tell you about before they prepare the tax forms, but they don't tell you about the $49.95 before they prepare the Federal. After you have answered all the questions and the forms have been completed, they tell you you’re going to be charged. You can't print it out before you pay the $49.95. They pretty much had me where they wanted me and then said give me the money. First, I went on the web and Googled Free Tax Preparation. What comes up is Turbo Tax Fed Free Edition Last year was free. I had no reason to believe that only 1040EZ was free. Yes, I chose the Deluxe because it clearly states recommended for returning customers. The bottom states Start for Free. It also states Free e-file included. This web page led me to believe the 1040EZ was not going to be sufficient for my return. Owning a home, making charitable contributions and medical expenses would require the Deluxe Edition. I didn't pay for the Federal Prep last year, only the State portion. That's where I figured they made their money and I don't have a problem with that. What cost me $39.95 last year cost me $89.90 this year.
I have purchased Turbo Tax for Home and Business, $95.00, and while I was doing my taxes, it requested $35.95 and another $35.95 and to file, another $29.95. Until now, I didn't have my taxes done. There is no customer service. They will not answer their phone. I have sent emails with no response. So far, I have paid more than $200 and nobody to talk to. It's the worst experience I have ever had. I will never recommend Turbo Tax again to anybody at all. Now I don't know what to do. I want to cancel everything and get my money back. I will take them to small claims court for service not rendered. I am very disappointed in Turbo Tax.

No Turbo Taxes again for sure.
I originally started with a free e-file tax program and by the time I finished, it was $42.45 plus sales taxes. I have no idea when or why that changed. Then after completing the form in which I filled out information to have the owed federal taxes taken out of our account automatically by a debit type system, I got to the e-file finish and the taxes were filed alright but not the deduction from our bank account. Although I didn't discover this until returning home from work and reading the email that the forms had been accepted but I owed a certain amount and was going to pay by check. It is now 11:15pm on 4/15/09. So I frantically try to reenter the information on the forms and submit an amended return. But I could not get to the information needed to make such an adjustment. Finally, I found a form that told me where I could pay online for another $10.96 fee. I wonder if the late payment would have been any more than the $57.46 I paid for TurboTax convenience. I will never ever use this service again and I would never ever recommend it to anyone!
My federal refund was rejected and I understand why, so I went through the Tax Act for it but still did my state through Turbo Tax and that was on 02/09/09. I have resubmitted it 3x and it still has not gone through. Here it is April 15th, I talked to a rep and did not tell them that I filed somewhere else and the guy was telling me that I cannot file my state taxes until I file my federal and the IRS will not accept it. This guy did not know what he was talking about, because I had already filed and gotten my return for federal and I demanded a refund for the $69.90 they took from me. I would just go to my state sites and file them myself. The guy just kept saying I couldn't file them until I did my federal. So, I hung up on him and now I am doing a live chat with a rep and he is having me re-efile for the 4th time now. Now, he wants me to do it again! Oh, wait my session has magically ended. Weird, so now let's sit and wait another 20 min. for another rep to go through the same thing with me and still no resolution. I will never use Turbo Tax again. They charge you and you don't get any satisfaction.
I have used TurboTax for the past 4 years and never had a problem until this year. Unfortunately, I e-filed without closely reviewing the return. When filing away my file copies which I had printed, I noticed several errors with Schedule D. Items that should have been short term gain/loss were considered long term and vice versa. There were 4 incorrect entries all together; one was my input error, the others appeared to be Intuit error. My input was correct, but no matter what I'd do, the system put in the wrong place on Schedule D. I never had any problems before, but am now leery of Intuit. I'll need to do an amended return now, but will hand compute rather than use the software. I don't trust it now.
Already paid fees and unable to e-file due to AGI rejection. IRS said that the amount I am entering is correct. Turbo Tax's software is not working properly. Now, unable to print returns for filing by mail without Turbo Tax wanting more money.
I have filed tax online and then had to do an amended tax. The information that I enter does not show up on the final pages. In other words, some info does show up and other info gets left out. This happens after I save it. My father is now having to pay several hundred dollars back and I still don't know whether it is correct or not. I think that my father may be paying out more money to the government than he is supposed to.
Only after paying and filing my Federal return did the program find that the stimulus amount received in 2008 had not been included. I didn't know that it needed to be entered, and the program never asked me to. The e-file was rejected. Once I entered the amount, as instructed, my refund turned into a $375 balance due! My complaint is that since the return has changed, I should have the choice, once again, of filing or not and getting a refund from Intuit. But there is nobody to call who can help, nobody to talk to. Intuit has my money, and I have to file a return that I don't understand and don't agree with. This is not worth the money you think you might save by using this program. Have your taxes done by a live person who you can speak to, no matter how simple you think your return is.
I just attempted to install TurboTax via CD they sent me on my computer. I used the online purchase process and was issued an installation code. I typed it in numerous times and it failed every time. So, I went through the purchase process again (and I'm assuming that I will get billed twice now). I got the exact same installation code, and yes, I do know the last 4 digits of my credit card because it asks for that too when you install. I called Customer Support and was on hold for 40 minutes. When someone finally picked up, I got cut off!
I filed my 1040 (2008) through TurboTax on 3/17/09 which showed I owed the IRS $1519 which I opted to be paid to the IRS by bank debit on 4/10/09. I checked my bank account on 4/11/09 and found that the sum of $15,587 was paid to the IRS. TurboTax to date are unable to explain to me how this happened.
Last week, I was checking my emails on Gmail and there was an AdServe ad stating, Receive a Guaranteed $2,642 on your next Federal Tax Refund! I used Turbo Tax last year so I thought, why not check it out knowing that it was probably untrue? It was just a link to Turbo Tax. After thinking about it, I got really mad knowing that I was not the only person that was duped. This is not a fair practice and companies that use this type of marketing should be fined the maximum. The economy is bad enough without big companies scamming people during tax season. This is wrong and I think the people should know about Turbo Tax and the scams they try to get away with.
I purchased Turbo Tax online to file my federal and state (Arkansas) return. Everything went fine with the federal but when I got to the state section, I made the mistake of checking the box wishing to file an amended return. I immediately (before e-filing any return) went back and took this off, but it wouldn't go away and kept causing an error that prevented me from e-filing. I called Turbo Tax three times over this issue. By this time, I had e-filed my federal return because it specifically said on the website that I did not have to e-file federal and state together. Now that the state has been corrected by the Turbo Tax people, I am unable to e-file. I again called Turbo Tax, who tells me that in the state of Arkansas, you must e-file your federal and state together or you will have to mail in your state. That was not what the website stated and I demanded to speak with a manager (which the rep would not allow). I am still waiting on a refund of $34.95. I will never use Turbo Tax again and am sure to tell everyone I see not to use them either. What a joke!
First we e-filed our son's taxes using TurboTax. At the end of the process, TurboTax stated that we had finished. We then found out a week later that it had not been filed. We also filed our income tax a couple of days after our son's using TurboTax. Again, being told that we had finished, we found out later that it had not been filed. When we went to the TurboTax site, it was as if we were continuing our taxes and we had to send them in again. Due to the time sensitive dates that the taxes needed to be filed, we might lose thousands in college funds. We do not know yet but it might be around $5,000.00 to $10,000.00.
TurboTax Home and Business version is not suitable for use by the general public. I experienced two significant errors in computing my taxes for 2008. Both of the errors would have resulted in an incorrect tax return. Error #1: When entering data for a 1099 R, if box 2a taxable amount has not been completed (as in the case for Federal employees), TurboTax will treat the entire amount in box 1, Gross Distribution, as non-taxable. The error is further compounded since the taxable amount for Social Security amount would also be impacted. This error is a significant understatement of taxable income. Error #2: TurboTax selected the wrong tax from the tax table. In my case, it understated the tax by 6 (six) vertical locations on the tax table.
I paid $50 for the program. It would not download, said "there is an error." I can contact Turbo Tax support, but only computers. If I send it in, they say it will take a few months to see what the problem is. Meanwhile, I still need to do my taxes and will have to pay someone else to do them!
I completed my return using the TurboTax Home & Business online version. When I printed my return to review it, I discovered that TurboTax had used the standard deduction instead of the larger amount that I had entered. But a Schedule C was not included in the tax return, plus the figure did not match my deductions. The first person I spoke with couldn't figure out how to get a Schedule C printed. Then, she got her supervisor on the line, who assured me the amount was correct and that I didn't need a Schedule C because it was a standard deduction. I hung up and figured it out by hand. The itemized deduction is the highest and gives me the higher refund. I called them back and pointed out the error to a third person, who told me he is not allowed to think out of the box, that he had to think within the Turbo box and was not allowed to help me determine if amounts were correct. He did tell me, however, that I could send it to the IRS as is and try to get the difference from TurboTax, but that they wouldn't give it to me because they would say the box was right and that the audit guarantee is good only if I'm contacted by the IRS for an audit. He said 90% of the customers who found errors were right and that although he works for the company, he doesn't use the product. He surprised me by offering a refund, to which I immediately agreed. So he credited my card, listing dissatisfied with product as the reason (by the way, always use a credit card because debit cards don't offer consumer recourse). He gave me a confirmation number for the credit and I received an email confirming the refund (although no dollar amount was included). I'll wait a few days for the credit to show up on my card. If it doesn't, I will call my credit card company and dispute the charge through them. Meanwhile I'm redoing my return by hand and next year, I will find a good accountant. It's worth paying to avoid so much hassle.
I tried loading Turbo Tax Premier from a CD received error code 65535. I went through all help screens, tried all fixes and none worked. After 4 hours, I decided that was enough. After reading about all the other problems with TT accuracy, I am sending it back for a refund. You have 2 months from date of purchase. I won't purchase TTax again. Time lost, aggravation and hopefully, money will be refunded.
I used Turbo Tax Premier Home and Business version. Lots of miscellaneous problems, poor support from Intuit and much frustration. I ended up having to print and mail the returns at the suggestion of Intuit, as they couldn't figure out how to solve the problem. Too much anxiety. Never again will I use an online tax program. I'll never use the program again and I am going to sell my Intuit stock.
Your prices are too high! I changed to H&R Block Tax Cut Home and Business.
State income tax was rejected. According to the error given here, the software did not even ask about the part that needed to be fixed. My state income tax will be rejected again! The support personnel do not know how to handle the issue. Anthony, the representative, did not know what to do but instead advised me to call the IRS and State. The government authorities do no not have anything to do with the software failure. This is very frustrating to me, and I should be entitled to get my money back. This is ridiculous!
I did my taxes on TurboTax of 2008 return. When I submitted my direct deposit account information, somehow it was changed at TurboTax. It's been almost 2 months and have not yet have received my refund. Santa Barbara Bank and Trust failed to recall my refund that went into someone else's account because of TurboTax changing my direct deposit information. The IRS said it was out of their hands. I went to my local law enforcement office to fill a report and still have nothing resolved as of yet. Emailed TurboTax and they haven't responded to any of my emails. There is something going on at TurboTax stealing money from people. I wonder if anyone else has had this happened to them. If so, let me know who do I get in touch with to get this matter fixed.
Turbo Tax keeps telling me that it is up to date. However, when I try to file, it says "Forms not final". I do not have a complicated form. Manual updates, automatic updates all say that they are successful. Yet when I try to file, I still get forms not final. It is almost April and the forms are not final??? I am not a computer novice and have been a long time user of Turbo Tax. Their response has been unimpressive to say the least. I paid good money for a product that does not work.
Instead of a refund from my state, I owe $600 due to Turbo Tax not transposing federal to state correctly. Last year it did the same to my son. I owe $600 by April 15th and do not have it.
PROBLEM WITH TURBOTAX DELUXE 2009 - I discovered a problem when working on a tax return schedule C part four. This is the section where mileage is reported. The mileage rates were changed in 2008 by the IRS. The mileage for January through June was at one rate and July through December at a different rate. Schedule C on this particular version of Turbotax DOES NOT CALCULATE the mileage for you. This MEANS that if you TRUSTED this software to work on your behalf and did not catch this while preparing your taxes, you're missing out on YOUR DEDUCTION!!! After spending much time explaining the issue to Support, when they saw they could not find a solution, they SIMPLY HUNG UP THE PHONE ON ME. That was just getting me more annoyed than the problem at hand.
I requested a refund of the $19.95 fee to efile my Massachusetts state return. I received a paper check for a fraction of the refund I was owed; this is because the state required written documentation of the days worked outside of Massachusetts. I mailed this, and received the balance of my refund. I called Turbotax on 3/27/09 to request a refund for the filing fee. I spoke to a man named Jerry, who was very unprofessional, did not seem to know the systems, and was breathing heavily into the phone in a way that was rather obscene, and made me very uncomfortable. I repeatedly asked to be transferred to someone else, and he refused. After being on the phone with him for 21 minutes, I called the # again and spoke with Kristen, a competent and helpful customer service rep. She was not authorized to give me a refund, and referred me to her supervisor, Steve. Steve also would not give me a refund, despite my poor experience with Jerry and the fact that they should not have allowed the efile to be done in the first place because of the required employer documentation. He tried to tell me that if I hadn't efiled, it would have taken up to three months to receive my refund. I told him that I would not be using their products again and would post my comments on websites which review tax products. Hopefully I will save someone else from paying unnecessary fees. He also promised to look into Jerry's obvious need for training. I'm out $19.95, and they have lost a long-time customer. I will not be purchasing TurboTax or any other InTuit product again.
I have used Turbo Tax for 5 years now and have never had a problem. This year I don't know what they have done to the online program but it stinks! I entered my information 3 times and still kept having problems with my HSA information. Not only that but the calculations weren't even correct! Thank goodness I checked with a calculator prior to filing. I also was not able to deduct all of my Points for a house we purchased in 2008 but the program kept trying to spread it out over the life of the loan. I ended up filing my return with Tax Act instead and had NO problems at all with the HSA or Points information that Turbo Tax kept giving me problems with. I will NOT use Turbo Tax again. When you call them to tell them there is a problem they say they will look into it and then you never hear from them. Wasted several hours fixing and reentering information that was right to begin with all to find out there was a glitch in their software that they never did fix.
We ordered our update CD over 5 weeks ago, and we still have not received it. They say they will email confirmation, but we never got one. So we re-ordered and there is still no response. I have used them for over 9 years. Never again! I don't have $50 to blow for this kind of service. Can you please help?
I live in Washington State and have rentals in Hawaii. Therefore, I pay income tax in Hawaii. I have asked for a Hawaii State income tax disk 3 times and never received one. I do not do my taxes on a computer that has access to the internet. Why is this concept so difficult to understand? I went through the same process with you last year with the same results. I got in trouble with the State of Hawaii because I placed my rental income under rentals. The State said I was a stupid main-lander. I had to amend my taxes and fight with the state for 3 months. I do not want to go through this again.
The IRS released their 2009 941 Quarterly Report Form on 02/19/09. It is now 03/24/09 and Intuit has still not released their update with this form. Their response is that the report is not due until 04/30/09, so they believe that they still have time. Anybody who processes payroll knows that you do not send your client's one report at a time. You send them in a packet. I have clients whose last payroll was on 03/20/09 and their 941 deposits are due on 03/25/09. I can't send them their quarterly reports because I don't have the form update yet. This is very unprofessional and makes my firm look as if we cannot accommodate our customers' needs. I've been attempting to contact a supervisor at Intuit for the last week - by phone, survey and using their online community Q&A. Intuit has NO FORMAL COMPLAINT PROCESS! There is no one I can talk to or write to that will address this or any other complaint issue.
We received a notice from the IRS yesterday regarding our 2007 tax return. They claimed that we didn't claim the retirement income on our taxes for that year. Knowing that I put the information into the tax program, I immediately pulled our tax return and low and behold, it was missing. Considering that I just used Turbo Tax again to prepare our 2008 taxes, I pulled that return out as well...not there. I went on the Turbo Tax website and went to the section where this income is reported. It was there, the 1099-R information. However, the tax we paid on it was used in the return, but not the income. I tried for 2 hours to find some support for this problem to no avail. This is extremely upsetting. We don't know what to do about this. This company should have to pay back this money. Now, we owe $2,996.00 for tax for year 2007, and 2008 will be the same. This is an undue burden. My husband is recovering from cancer, and I just had two back operations. Where do you find money to pay back to the IRS when you don't have any real means?
Turbotax.com: I was unable to access my personal account information. System could not recognize my user ID or password. Technical support went back over the steps to reset password. Password was stored on Windows and Norton. Unable to access account through technical support. Information on the website needed, but no access. Requested someone who could provide the information requested. Walked back through the steps to fix the website, but still no access! Spent about three hours of waiting and walking through the steps to gain access. Still unresolved, still cannot access information on the website, and information on the website still needed.
I got the TurboTax CD, installed it, updated it, and did my taxes. A couple of weeks later, when I tried to go back to add a charitable donation, the software did another update and then told me that my 2008 tax return was for a previous year and could not be opened.
I purchased TurboTax 2008 at Walmart for $29.99. Used it to prepare and e-file my Federal 1040. I had planned to use an e-file facility on the OK TAX Commission website to file my State Tax Return, but there was none I qualified for. I went to TurboTax.com and purchased on my credit card to prepare my OK State Tax Return. It cost $39.99. At the end, they charged my credit card another $19.99 to e-file!! Go figure!!! All the calculating had already been figured with the 2008 TurboTax Basic I had purchased from Walmart, and now they charged me $39.99 to dump the information into the State Tax Return forms, and then charged me another $19.99 to e-file it to the state!!! Is this a rip-off or what? No wonder our current bad boy US Treasury Secretary Tim Geitner had problems with his taxes when he used TurboTax!!! No more! For my simple tax 2009 tax return, I will have my previous accountant do them, and I know he won't cost more than TurboTax to just fill out the papers!!! What a rip!!! I will never use TurboTax again. Besides, the longer they are in business, the worse the product...it's much more difficult to use this year...never clear if a correction was accepted or not...and it kept continuously updating!!!
I used TurboTax Deluxe version to enter my tax information. I ran the error and audit check multiple times for both state and federal taxes. It came back with no errors. I paid them around $65 and tried to e-file my taxes. After accepting the payment, it then showed me an error in my tax information. This only showed up after they processed the payment. Like many others, I won't be using TurboTax next year.
I used TurboTax Deluxe like I have for the last 7 or 8 years. I ended up paying over $1,000. We are senior citizens and really don't make a lot. We ended up responsible for half of my husband's Mandatory Required Distribution because the company claimed the computer skipped over it so we have to pay $1,700 to the Federal Government. TurboTax figured but gave no instructions on how to do it. They also discontinued their Estimated Tax Program so I am left trying to determine how much it is, etc. I was very unhappy with TurboTax this year and do not intend to purchase it again.
After logging in all my personal information, I was unable to print a copy of my income tax return. I have the latest Adobe software required. Their software has a bug that kicks you out every time you try & print your income tax return. It reboots Internet Explorer.
Have used this product on line for several years successfully, until now. This year it fails to allow corrections or edits and generally out of order I will go back to 1040 paper form.
I used Turbotax to file out my income tax. I was promised a free e-file. The return was rejected several times by IRS saying that the AGI does not match. I used Turbotax for the last 10 years. I contacted Turbotax and received a poor support. As I did not received adequate Tech support from Turbotax I mailed my return and has to wait 6 weeks. I think they need to provide more support and include a proper disclosure. I was not able to get a phone or a physical address to send my complain.
I filled out my taxes, submitted the Federal Form and got a confirmation on 2/8/09. I never got my refund. I checked with IRS on 3/14/09. They never received it. I have tried to contact Turbo Tax with no luck. I give up. I am going to send my Federal forms in myself. Turbo Tax took $64.15 from my checking account on $2/11/09. I, like many others, won't be using them again!!!!!
I purchased TurboTax on Jan. 9th and I have the receipt. It would not install on my computer. I've talked with several CSRs but could not get it to install. I was made aware of the refund policy on March 11th by a CSR, 2 days beyond the 60-day deadline. The refund policy should have been told to me at the time of the first call which would have been prior to the 60-day limit. Now I'm out $42 bucks. I still don't have my taxes done and must find an alternate method of getting them done within the next month.
I have been trying to update TurboTax 2008 for 2 days with no luck, failure to connect with server. I would like a disc for TurboTax Premier that updates the tax program. I am amazed that the program lacks so many forms.
I filed our taxes on February 3, 2009 and received all the notification that it had been done, from Turbo Tax. I did not hear from the federal government. I called today, 3/10/09, to discover that my taxes had not been sent and I am getting nowhere with Turbo Tax. They also charged me $49 for the FREE SERVICE. I called the IRS and was informed that they had not received my electronic filing and I now have to send them a paper copy of the taxes, so that they can be processed. This was my first time to file on Turbo Tax and, believe me, it is the last.
I did my taxes with Turbo Tax; no problem there but my biggest complaint is that they didn't tell me that they were going to charge an additional $30 to get my taxes fee deducted from my refund and that it would take longer to get my refund. I filed on 2/21/09 and have yet to receive my refund. My boyfriend did it right after I did mine but paid it with his credit card and received his refund a week later. I'm really pissed off and I think I should get my $30 fee that they didn't tell they were charging for having it sent to Santa Barbara Bank. I was complaining to a friend about it and he told me that he did it the same way as I did last year and had the same problem! If you do your taxes with Turbo Tax, pay it with your credit card if you don't want to have problems receiving your refund!!
Unbelievable: Used over 7 years, not a problem. I have now spent over 20 hours over past month attempting just to load the CD. I have the disk and along with Microsoft C Care have rebuilt, cleaned, and disabled any virus protection and still no success. It seems it revolves around MS .netframe 2.0 product. I wanted my money back but no response mail or otherwise. Auto line says they are sending me a replacement CD - mine was damaged??? I just want to get my money back. I will love to sue them and if that is something I never said about anything. What a shame, just when folks need all the help they can get it to work. Consequences: I am going to be late and cannot afford to negotiate with TT or STATe, etc. I have attempted to catch up on back state taxes but must complete 2008 to do so. A tax accountant at this point will be hundreds of dollars, which I don’t have but must get to avoid massive penalties. I have missed work and hate anything to do with TT government. You try to do the right thing - buy a product with previously great results, and overnight, a disaster in the making.
Attempted to use TurboTax for preparation of tax return. I got very frustrated, so I cut the computer off. I have received a confirmation filing my return, which is not complete. I wish to cancel that order. I cannot find how to do so. I find no phone number or email address to make a request for cancellation. That return is not complete - therefore, not correct.
I had recently paid $25.95 for filling out my state taxes but it did not go through. I would like a refund back.
Installed program from CD. It said, "Thank you for putting in your W2s" when I hadn't even entered one!! I found where to enter them. I got all the way to entering college credits. It only had me and my husband to credit. I went back and found my kids were not even entered on the return under dependents, even though the info was imported and they were showing up on the info form. It also told me to itemize even though my itemizing was only $9,000.00. I also do not want to join a community. I am afraid this program will miss something important so I will go back to Tax Cut.
I have used Turbo Tax last five years. Never had problem. This year it will not load properly. I continue to get error message 1327 (whatever that means). When I attempt to unload Turbo Tax 2008, it will not unload and I cannot get the programs to attempt to load again. Turbo Tax has loaded a hidden file on my computer that I cannot get rid of. Now I cannot load tax files, and TT customer assistance is very poor. This is really screwing me up when trying to do my taxes. Turbo Tax is a pain in the neck this year and is really putting me out hours of work.
I have used Turbo Tax for ten years and each year more problems develop. Apparently they are trying to anticipate every question a customer might ask which is impossible. Problem #1 was downloading the state program took one week. #2 was entering IRA roll over funds. When I rolled over the various funds, some were new and Turbo Tax had no provisions for entering those dollars. Next was three 1099R; each had a different amount that was cashed out and when I rolled them over with a greater dollar amount, the program would not accept them. I sent emails three times and talked with three people. Today, I spent one and a half hours on the phone and the person was very nice and tried to find a way to enter the correct dollars but finally admitted that it could not be done. Now, I must use a CPA to do my taxes and this will probably cost between 75 and 150 dollars but at least it will end three weeks of frustration. Although I have been a long time customer, next year, I will check out other programs.
I have been using the online version of Turbo Tax for years now, but this year have experienced nothing but trouble. It keeps erasing my return, logging me out and now is asking for some sort of cost basis for charitable donations, even though none of them were over $250. I have contacted their support 3 times and get the same canned answer.
Again using TurboTax Deluxe 2008, mainly because I used TT last year and was able to connect to it. There is a bug in the software for entering an annuity that was rolled over to another annuity. It is showing the full amount as taxable even though the correct code is entered in line 7. I found several other complaints about this on their website and after reading the complaints here, wonder if it will be resolved. Feedback does not get you answers and it took several tries to get an email complaint form. So far I have not tried to file because I want this income issue resolved, but the feedback I found about filing does not encourage me to use TTax again.
TurboTax now requires an ID and password and does not adequately provide for confirmation or retrieval of them if there is a problem. Instructions are not in sync with the program instructions, i.e. drop down lists do not match the instructions. The requirement that you need to wait 48 hours for a response is absurd and causes undue hardship and frustration for the customer. There is too much government for the tasks at hand. Retired people do not need the problems TurboTax causes. My past experiences with this company’s non-support shows our government lack of concern for the taxpayer.
Something TurboTax does not reveal in its advertising. There is a limit of 3,000 transactions. Above this, the program shuts down, apologizes and lets you know that you can request a refund. A user will have put in 20 to 50 hours entering all their scheduled transactions until they hit 3,000 and then the programs says that you can't go any further. They should be made to tell the public about this limitation before they purchase the program and waste all that time.
We use TurboTax to file our 2007 1040 return. The program did not find any errors and we submitted for our refund. We recently (2-24-09) received a letter from the IRS requesting a copy of our 2007 schedule A. We got a copy of our '07 schedule A from TurboTax website recently filed tax returns and reviewed the document. We were astonished to discover then that there was an error on property tax paid line. The property tax filed was nearly 3/4 of million dollars! We did extensive research and found that a decimal point was not entered for the cents amount of our actual property tax paid. So instead of a four-digit number (thousand, hundred and ten), decimal point and two digits for cents, a full six-digit number was on the property tax line filed amounting to HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS! TurboTax didn't pick this up in the error scan!? How the hell would a Taxpayer who makes less than $100,000 a year, pay nearly three quarters of million in property taxes? What does one have to own in real estate to pay hundreds of thousands in property taxes? Whatever it is, it would not be someone making my ridiculous salary. My point: The error scan is a service that we pay for.
I purchased Intuit TurboTax Deluxe at Sam's Club, submitted a mail-in rebate for $10, and was refused rebate by Intuit. They state in the refusal notice that the store where you purchased the product does not honor this particular rebate. Gee, I thought it was Intuit who was providing the rebate, not the retailer!!! Intuit did not state anywhere on the rebate form that if you buy from certain retailers then the rebate is invalid. This is deceptive and dishonest practice. I have been using TurboTax for at least 15 years and this is the last time I will use it.
I am trying to e-file and it won't accept my AGI from last year though I know it is correct. I can file by mail, but what a pain. I would call their helpline, but it costs so much money. Others are complaining of the same problem on the website. I liked the ease of use and the layout of the website, but this is too frustrating. I have already paid, and now I am regretting not using H&R Block!!!
I have used Turbo Tax for years without a problem. This year, my state tax will not efile. It says a form is not ready. After hours on the phone with Turbo Tax Support, they identified the issue as a program bug. They told me there would be a fix in 24 to 48 hours. It has been weeks and I still can't efile the return. I purchased the premier version with free state efile. If I have to mail my return, then I am due money back.
I never had a problem installing or using Turbo Tax on my computer. The trouble with a lot of folks (aside from they use a computer without doing any research) is that you should temporarily suspend the firewall when installing any software such as Turbo Tax because of its online update services. It does have one quirk that I have disabled and that is it phones home to Intuit, the makers of the software but that's easy to fix.
The program has a BUG when working with EARNED INCOME CREDIT. Be careful; it incorrectly calculates, sometimes deducts, sometime adds EIC. So check everything before you send it to the IRS. If you intend to use Turbo Tax 2009, know how EIC credit works to dismiss your TurboTax mistakes. More specifically, when you click edit on the EIC screen, it grants you EIC credit for your dependents and at the same time it says that you are NOT qualified to receive EIC. For average users, the program might be confusing and erroneous to calculate EIC with TurboTax. Also be careful on using TurboTax services when sending your state returns. It is better if you mail them yourself. If you cannot get on the other screen and you are still waiting, do not click the Place Order button too many times. The program will just keep charging you $19.95 plus available taxes. There should be a way for the program to recognize if the payment has been processed. So, it's a total mess. Apparently, I had clicked over 20 times because I could not get to the other screen, and it charged me $399.80. I am so pissed off. I spent almost 3 hours on hold. The rep did not know why it happens; he first refused to give me my money back and told me they will need to investigate this further. I still have to call and request my money.
The Intuit Turbo Tax Deluxe 2008 CD program fails when checking for updates. None of the recommended or suggested repairs from the Turbo Tax online support site works. Phone support is virtually non-existent with the ridiculously-long wait times. Emails are not answered, and questions posted to their support team are not only not answered, but also can't be found in the list of postings after the fact.
I purchased Turbo Tax Deluxe 2008. I received error code 65535 when trying to install. At 15%, the installation fails. I have been on the phone w/ Intuit four times, to no avail. At this point, they say there is no cure for my problem, and they will e-mail me when there is a fix.
I filed my taxes on Feb. 7th. I have not received my IRS confirmation notice and can't find out if it has been filed.
Turbo Tax has advertised $29.95 to file state. I filed both Fed and State and was returned twice with no reason. I submitted it a third time and was approved. But then I was charged additional $34.95 for refiling. I never changed anything the 4 times it was submitted.
I filed my taxes only to be told they haven't been received by the IRS, yet it has been 3 weeks. I paid the fee and haven't received the service. I have re-filed with Taxslayer hoping to receive better service. I want TurboTax to refund my fee and will not be using their services ever again!
I used TurboTax 2008 with the CD as no one should just go online and use it without, as this is just common sense. I filled in my form, able to go back several times and fill in as things came in. I printed and had my federal and state filed and my money was in my account for federal within one week and three weeks for my state. I paid $65 for the software and last year, I paid $206 for tax services. Plain and simple, you just do not do anything so vital as income taxes, etc. without the software in your possession. I can still go back and view my information as everything is on my PC as long as I have the software which I do. Just today, I needed a copy of my tax return. I loaded the CD, clicked on TurboTax on my desktop and no problem, a copy of both printed.
I purchased and installed TurboTax Deluxe 2008. The first issue I encountered was I could not download the free state return. I called the support center and a representative provided a work around. The next issue was I could not e-file my state return. I made two attempts and each time, I was prompted for payment information. I checked my credit card and found I had been charged twice but my state returned had not been filed. I called the support center and the first thing they did was refund both charges. At Intuit's suggestion, I tried to e-file the state a third time. I received a message stating the payment did not complete. I was prompted to click continue to try again. I still could not e-file the state return. I tried four more times with a different credit card. Same message: The payment did not complete. Click continue to try again. I checked my credit cards and I was charged each time I clicked continue to try again. I called support a second time and was eventually told they did not know why it wouldn't work. Their solution to the problem is to print and mail in my state return. This kind of defeats the whole purpose of using TurboTax. So far, Intuit has managed to charge me eight times for a total of $159.60 but can't e-file my state return. I am waiting to see if their process for refunding my money works as well as their process for taking my money.
They don't answer emails explaining why you cannot itemize for state taxes. I spent way too much time trying to figure it out and sent many, many emails that they claim they will answer. I have heard nothing, and tried using various emails. Nothing worked. They have lousy communication. All programs should allow you to not itemize for Fed, then you should be able to go back and redo and itemize for state easily.
After completing my Federal and NYS Income taxes using TurboTax Home and Business, I have been unable to e-file after several attempts due to Error: 2. On researching this error type, I have learned that Many consumers have experienced this same error and have sought resolution without satisfaction. I have attempted to contact Intuit & sent multiple e-mails without response. A message appears that they have been working on this problem since approximately January 29, 2009. I am unable to complete my daughter's Federal application for financial aid until my taxes have been processed. I paid $85.87 plus tax for this software in addition to $19.95 to file NYS tx electronically. I have spent numerous hours attempting to resolve this issue.
I filed my taxes with Turbo Tax. It keeps getting rejected by the IRS because of an error. I corrected the error but Turbo Tax does not. The filing was to be free, but when they got the information, Turbo Tax informed me I had to pay $34+ so stupid me, I gave them my debit card information. They got my money and have done nothing for me. There is no way to contact them with the problem. I don't even know if I should go elsewhere to file taxes or what to do. How can they get away with this? After the fact, I read a huge amount of complaints about Turbo Tax. I need my money back, or my taxes filed and I really need to know soon. Thank you.
I paid $59.95 for the Deluxe version with free efile. Sure, the efile was free but they charged me $29.95 to process my refund through Santa Barbara Bank! It wasn't a rapid refund loan; it was just my money coming direct from the IRS! To top it off, it held up me getting the refund. I did my fiance's taxes with TaxACT Online the same day. He got his refund on the stated date without being charged, and I'm still waiting! Why don't they put “We will hold your refund hostage for $29.95" on the box? I want to know how many other people out there are as pissed as I am. What can be done?
I went to the TurboTax website to file my 2008 income tax. I did everything I was required. I even paid the fee for using their services although it said it was free, which nothing is free in life. I submitted my tax return application but when I called the IRS, I was told that they didn't have any record of my submitted paperwork. So I went back to the TurboTax website to try to get information as to why IRS didn’t have any of my paperwork. I printed all the paperwork for myself. So now, I have to mail the IRS all the paperwork again. The worst part about TurboTax is that there is no way to get in contact with them. No number to call, reach a person to talk to or anything. To me, that is messed up.
Do not use TurboTax online! I am very disenchanted with this service. The free e-filing isn't free! I feel as though I've been nickel-and-dimed by this company. Also, the bank in which they work with received my refund and was to directly deposit my refund into my account. My refund check has now been mailed to me because the bank claims that I didn't include a number in my checking account number. I've looked at my info and it is correct! The bank is charging me $5 to mail me the check. I am beyond furious. Do not use TurboTax!

I have done my taxes online for years with TurboTax using the same user ID, password and security answer with no issues at all. This year, none of that information works. I am completely unable to log in and had great concern that someone (not me) had changed one or more of these pieces of information acquiring access to my tax history. After an extended online chat that never addressed my primary concern (how did my user ID, password and security answer get changed), I was told I should simply start a new account! I have gone through the online steps to reset my email address (even though they have sent me email at my current email address) and am awaiting a response but I will not be using TurboTax to do my 2008 filing. If TurboTax has done an upgrade that has caused certain log-in information to change, there should have been a notification issued to address it.
Turbo Tax is a ripoff. While preparing my 2008 tax returns, I noticed the information being transferred to the state forms was incorrect. I spent over 50 minutes on hold and nobody picked up my call. I sent emails and nobody contacted me. After 2 more attempts and over 40 minutes waiting, I was helped by one of their representatives who basically told me to reinstall the software from their website and try again. The problems still continue and they refuse to give me any sort of credit back. I spent $50 for a product that doesn't work.
TurboTax Federal & State FLAWED. I have been using the online version of the software for about 4 years now with no problem until this year. I completed the forms and found I was getting back $4700 Federal and owed $747 to Ohio. I noticed that the 1099 for my wife was not allowing me to deduct the un-reimbursed portion of that payment received from a company she did $600 worth of work for. We then decided to go ahead and just do it manually and we were shocked. We were actually due $6,000+ Fed and owe Ohio $527!!! We would have lost $1,500 if we had not noticed the 1099 error. Would have lost $1,500!!! Dodged a bullet!!!
I did my taxes using TurboTax for the state of MA. They were rejected 4 times. I called the MA Dept. of Revenue, and they said there was nothing wrong and all questions were answered correctly. They said it was a problem with TurboTax. I called TurboTax and it was still an issue. I asked for a refund and they claimed they could not give me any type of refund. I spend countless hours on the phone and their hold times are outrageous. The reason I went to them was to save time, and it cost me more time than I could imagine. I am very unhappy! Consequence: an immense amount of time on the phone and online re-filing my MA taxes!
I purchased TurboTax Basic from Wal-Mart. I finished filling out the forms and e-filed. The next day I received a notice that my submission had been rejected. There was no code number or anything. Out of curiosity, I googled TurboTax e-file rejection and I find a few sites with people posting complaints who have had the same experience. I've used TurboTax for years without any trouble. It would be nice if someone gave a reason my tax form was rejected. If the problem lies with the company, it would be nice if they made their customers aware that there was a problem. Next year, I'll be investigating another product.
Haven't been able to download the program and get varying explanations as to why. Can't find a human being to help me and none of the fixes corrected the problem. I've spent the better part a day. I will never purchase TurboTax again. It's easier to prepare my taxes by hand - my hand. I've used TurboTax for a number of years and had some small problems. But this year, I can't even download the software.
I bought it due to my taxes. It was easy to put in, but the program told me I would make more by filing married than filing separate. When it was filed, my husband's went through but when I put mine through, it said I owed $1,700. Where would it be better? It also did not state on the deluxe one that you would have to pay for the state form to download. It told me I would need to download Illinois too due to my husband working over there. The program did not transfer everything over to state so it was missing information.
Both my husband and I file taxes online with TurboTax - they promised refund within 8 days - the taxes cost us $50+ each and we did not see our federal refund for 4 weeks. The amounts we received were both wrong, lower than online with TurboTax. We have still not received our state refund 6 weeks later. It is impossible to call or email; all they have are automated messages of 60 minutes' hold time. I will never use again.
It does not transfer information correctly to State of MO. 1099R for rollover is handled correctly by Federal when box 2 is checked taxable amount (0), but State shows it as taxable. Also, public school retirement is only taxed on 65% of the amount. TurboTax shows public school retirement is handled differently, but it does not have a place to put in the public school retirement amount. It is all taxable to the federal government, but not to the State. I have to take my return to a tax preparer. I will take TurboTax back to Sam’s for a refund and will never use it again.
I paid for TurboTax download online, but could not install so I had to go back and do my taxes online with the same company. They charged me again. I contacted customer support to get my money back for the download and was informed to contact customer service. So I tried to find a website or phone number for customer service with no luck. I have used their product for five years. Next year I will use TaxACT. My credit card was charged two times for one product with no way to contact the company to resolve the problem.
I prepared two basic Fed and MD State returns for electronic filing. The end result, program would not allow me to pay to electronically file MD State return. After being on the phone first on hold for close to 1 hour, then for over 2 hours with a helpful but stymied representative and doing everything possible to try and correct the problem, the end result was the same. I had to electronically file the Federal and then go to the MD iFile website and re-enter all info to electronically file for free. I have 3 more returns to prepare. And I do not look forward to having to re-input all of the information at another website when I paid a considerable amount for this software and it does not work. Yes, I could paper file the state but that's not what I choose to do. There has been no economic damage unless I consider the value of the time I have wasted on this effort in futility. On the plus side, so far I have saved $40 to minimally offset the value of my time. However, it has not been a win-win situation and I am still angry. I may not buy TurboTax again, so we both will share in the consequences.
I purchased TurboTax to do my 2008 taxes. When I try to play the videos that are a part of TurboTax, I got an error message that said to check my network settings. Online chat with a product support person and email to technical support all produced the same answer: “We don't support video.” How can you put something in a product you are selling to the public and then say you don't support some of it?
I tried to install the TurboTax programming on my home PC. Nothing happened. I tried all of the suggested fixes offered by their website. It still didn't load. I spent a total of 2.5 hours on the phone with someone in India trying to get an answer, but to no avail. Finally, I quit and waited, thinking I would do it on a different computer. Since then, I have discovered all of the other people having problems with TurboTax this year. Fortunately, I was not able to use the program, otherwise, I would be having problems with the IRS along with a million other hard working Americans. Obviously, Intuit's programming department has had a major lapse in qualified personnel.
I purchased the TurboTax tax preparation software to prepare my income tax returns for the year 2005. In the process of calculating my tax credits for my Massachusetts state form, the amount for taxes paid to another state or jurisdiction was incorrectly transferred from my previously prepared Rhode Island state return. The figure used was much higher than the actual amount that I paid to the state of Rhode Island. This caused the amount that I actually owed to Massachusetts to be lower than it should have been. I came to know of this error because I just received a notice of assessment from the Massachusetts Department of Revenue. This error has resulted in an accrued interest charge of $88.00. It also has caused a lot of emotional stress. I am very unhappy with Quicken, in that I had great confidence in their warranty that the calculations were accurate.
TurboTax made a computer glitch error on our 2008 tax return, and the IRS was not notified. I called them, and they said it was a glitch in the system from TurboTax, which caused my family to lose $958. In conclusion, I believe that TurboTax is reliable, and so is the IRS.
I have used Turbo Tax for five years with no problems. This year the changes they have made have caused me numerous problems, most notably that it will not allow me to file by itemizing deductions, insisting that I have to go to only the standard deduction. Calling their phone number is useless as they can't seem to understand what I am saying. After reading other problems, I have no intention of trying to e-file even if I could get the program to itemize. I did my taxes by hand, had it checked by a tax expert and will file it manually. I will never purchase Turbo Tax again and will advise anyone I know to also not buy this product. It is a shame that a business that was so good has so quickly become useless. Can't wait to see how long it takes to try and get a refund.
I have used Turbo Tax for years since H&R Block software went kapooie. This year, Turbo Tax has done worse. It's hard to use, hard to go back and change things. I cannot knock the name of taxpayer off if I made an error. Ask question you don't need. Why did they mess it up? No more Turbo software for me. I have worked at IRS and H&R Block, so I do something about taxes!
I will never use Turbo Tax again, plain and simple. Their forms are flawed and so is their verification process for e-filing. We e-filed numerous times only to get a rejected error on Form 8399 Adoption Credits, saying our son's last name didn't match his SS#. After hours on the phone with SSA and IRS, indicating yes, the last name and SS# we had entered on the form was correct; and after numerous calls to Turbo Tax experts and emails to the website, all should have been in line. Turbo Tax's only explanation was for us to file by snail mail. After reading all of the numerous complaints about Turbo Tax's software, I decided to go with another company - TaxAct. It was $60 cheaper, just as easy to file. I entered the same exact information as I did with Turbo Tax, and two weeks later to the day, our return was accepted by the IRS when we filed with Tax Act. Intuit's customer service is poor. Their tax experts don't care how poor their product is, and many many families, possibly adoptive families, will have to wait needless weeks for their refunds when they are told to file by mail, because Turbo Tax cannot make a product that works.
They added on $75,000 and didn't include any prior input for my EIC, which was not included in the final filing report.
The 2008 version of TurboTax will not update automatically as have all previous versions I've owned. In addition, I can't download the state version which I've paid for. I've had our outside IT consultant read the help information on their site, but even he couldn't get it to work.
I have been trying to find out if I am still getting my taxes direct deposited to me or not. I had 2008 AGI wrong and called IRS and than corrected it and no one got back to me to tell me if it is ok or not. I tried to find a phone number and could not. I have tried to email them and all I get is a automated machine who does not answer my question, well it does with other questions to answer. I am very upset with this company and do not know where to find out anything. At this point I do not know if I will be getting my tax Refund or not.
I could not download the TurboTax CA state software through the TurboTax Federal program as advertised. No manual downloads for state taxes are offered. I spent over 40 minutes waiting for online help and another hour with the representative who could not solve the problem working from a canned desktop support program. I could tell by the questions he asked that no help was forth coming. I am an advanced user and was way ahead of him at every turn. It was a joke! He always brought up the firewalls as the problem. No, I disabled them purposely to see if the download would work! The federal updates downloaded without a problem with the firewalls enabled. I have used TurboTax for many years and never had a problem. I will not use the program again unless they reinstitute manual download capability for the state program. TurboTax is not taking responsibility for their flawed program or download server problems. Is there any recourse? I am ticked to the max with Intuit/Turbo Tax. I will now be forced to buy another tax program to complete my taxes.
I am having the exact problem Stephanie from Dayton, OH is having (AIG incorrect). TurobTax makes you amend your return. After amending, it says you cannot e-file anymore. I have been going in loops with TurboTax!
Turbo Tax will not let me download and install the Missouri state return, which is included as part of the purchase price. I've seen many similar complaints since and a friend had the same problem. It is impossible to talk to someone in customer service using the toll-free number they have. It could be the company is going bankrupt or they just don't care. I intend to take Turbo Tax back to Sam's, get a refund and complain to them. They should not carry the software. I'll have to buy another program to file the state return or do it by hand. Either way, it's a lot of trouble and time is money.
I have used TurboTax to do my taxes. The IRS said my federal refund was deposited today, 2/10/09. I was told that my refund went to Santa Barbara Bank and Trust, and it would take a few days to get it to my bank. I was not told when I signed up for TurboTax that this would happen. When I called SBBT, they said they could not help me and to call TurboTax. I did, and TurboTax said it was out of their hands and to call SBBT. No one wants to help, and it doesn't seem like anyone cares.
This was the third time I have used Turbo Tax, but since it won't work, I will go elsewhere. The updating was never ending (computer would shut down after a few hours of it), the error messsages were continuous with no 'fix' available, the questions weren't answered correctly. I'll spend about $25 more and get some real help. What is Turbo Tax doing?

While entering my federal taxes using TurboTax Deluxe, I noticed that the total for Donations Powered by ITS Deductible seemed high. I checked the total against the detail contributions and the TurboTax number is $5,708 higher. I deleted all my entries, giving me $0 in details, and $5,708 still shows up. This skews my return and is just wrong. I cannot submit this return. I am trying to contact TurboTax and have them show me how to clear this number. I am also concerned that the problem may be affecting other people's returns. TurboTax keeps sending me email replies saying "We'll get back to you" or they give me answers totally unrelated. I am trying to point a software bug and they are ignoring me. Who can I contact? I saved some screen prints. Should I contact the IRS?
I tried to use the free version of TurboTax. After putting in all my personal information, which I thought was necessary for the return, it asked me to put my ID in again. Upon doing this, it indicated that it didn't recognize either my ID or password. I tried numerous times to do it again and got the same results. In some cases, they tell you that the server is down and to try again momentarily. I now realize that this is a big sham to get your information so they can contact you. What concerns me even more is that they have my Social Security numbers and other personal information which could be used against me. Warn all your friends not to buy or use this product. I wish I had seen this site before entering my information.
I got audited for the years 2006 and 2007 this January, thanks to TurboTax. I have just been handed a $13,000 bill by the IRS (which I am told could have been over $20K with penalties they did not assess). This is for the years 2006 and 2007, which I computed using TurboTax. Not only were figures for business mileage duplicated, in one instance they were almost tripled. In chatting with a licensed CPA, I was informed that they had corrected over 55 similar cases using Turbo this year - all with the same result. Lots more money owed. I am not even going to try to talk to TurboTax about this. I know it is useless and they will say I hit the wrong button or something, just exactly like the other 55 people did. Sure. And apparently, other CPAs are very aware of what's happening, but can't get the word out (my experience is 2 years too late). I now have in my hands a copy of TurboTax for 2009, which I intend to burn shortly. I will never recommend TurboTax or any tax software again, period. As far as I am concerned, TurboTax is dangerously flawed and ambiguous enough to get the average user in deep trouble quickly with the IRS. Oh and forget their tax protection service. It will tell you where the errors are on your form (which TurboTax said it checked automatically - complete with odds and averages of being audited - at the end of each year I used it, by the way). But in the end, it's your tax debt and you will pay every penny of it. TurboTax won't. So spend the $200-$300, go to a tax specialist (not H&R Block) and have it done properly, or you too can owe thousands of dollars to the IRS years after you have forgotten about some ancient year of taxes. Oh, and the IRS charges interest (late fees) on the money they find you owe them, starting from the year they found the error (in my case, 2 years interest). You'll owe that too, thanks to TurboTax.
I purchased TurboTax Deluxe 2008 for $59.99. I tried filing my taxes. I had to D/L an update. But I kept getting an error message "42002 Not connected to Internet"? So, I called TurboTax 4 times and got 4 different answers. I did everything - reset modem, changed settings on internet connection, almost bought a new computer. Finally I was informed by tech support to send the software and receipt back to Intuit. I wonder if and when I am going to get a refund.
I received the 65535 error installing. I followed online instructions and when that failed, I waited over 45 minutes to connect to an online chat support person. They instructed me to uninstall .NET 2.0 and reinstall. Since this requires a reboot, I would have to disconnect from the online chat. They didn't offer me any way of reconnecting and offered no number to bypass the 45-minute wait for phone support. Since this fix didn't work, I waited online for phone support only to be told by that person that while he could spend another hour, there really isn't a fix and I should do my taxes online. They didn't offer any credit option for the online, no quick refund offer, and since Staples won't let me return the software, I would have to mail the CD in for a refund. I was continually put on hold and transferred to supervisors, but no one could help. In the end, I was disconnected while on hold and even though I had given my number, I received no call back. Very bad customer service.
I purchased Turbo Tax 2008 federal + state + efile. I installed the product on 2/6/09 and quickly realized that is will not automatically update. I called Technical Support and someone finally answered phone after I was kept on hold for 48 minutes to apologize that the update server was having technical problems and I should try again in about 2 hrs. I have tried several times to download the state of North Carolina with no success. I keep getting the same error, Error 42016: Cannot connect to update site? I tried several times to contact Turbo Tax Technical Support but no one is answering the phone. At one point, I stayed on hold for over 65 minutes and nobody answered. I am very frustrated.
I went online to do my taxes. I have done my taxes for four years through TurboTax. I was always satisfied with the site and the way it was navigated for taxes. I went to the spot to pick for deluxe edition. I had a horrible time just making it through the sections that I needed to do for my federal taxes. I have never been so frustrated and confused as I was this year. I would stop and just look everywhere to find help or an answer to my confusion. It took me two days on and off to finish my federal return. In that timeframe, I was so lost and didn’t understand the way some of the things were set up to ask me about my union business and my driving to my union meeting and business. As I had stated, you can check my files. I have done this at least four times in the past and never was this upset with the way it was confusing me and not at all helping me move to the next lines. I ended up in tears and totally trying every single method in my power to just get out of the site. Of course, I was locked in with my credit card information. I can’t cancel. I can’t get out. I can’t go forward and lastly, I can’t figure out what I am doing wrong or right. The second day I was in tears and I decided to see if I had a way to call them, after all, I had emailed the group of individuals that together would try to help you. I find out that it cost a fee for that service. I asked a question for free and of course, they didn’t have the slightest idea what my problem was. I had 9 errors in the tax section and finally, I narrowed it down to 2 or 3 and boy oh boy, the three were a serious problem. I didn’t even see or understand what they wanted me to do. It just kept telling me that my days are overlapping and that I had to correct them. No matter what I did and what date I would put in the line, it won’t correct. I didn’t even see the error on the line to figure out how I could fix it. Well, to end this stupid story, I just kept forcing numbers in the line and I have no idea how but it finally worked. I went to the checker again and it allowed me to go to the end and get ready to see the information that they offer to you. I put in all my information and the machine/internet just sits there and spins and spins in circles. I was furious. It spun almost forever. I would go with the arrow forward and/or backward and keep trying this. I sent another email, really more again to the group and asked what the world is going on now and why is it spinning forever? Of course, no one knew why. I can’t even remember what made it do something. But next, it said that I will need to print my return and mail them. So oh of course I am so angry. For two days and 12 hours, I was doing this return and I get a message to mail it. I paid $55 to e-file this over the internet and have it direct deposited and I get this. I have looked for a number to call the Turbo line but there isn’t any. I have been cheated out of a lot. I finally went to the state site because I am locked in. I did the state and I am thoroughly mad for using this entire Turbo site. I filed the states return online and told them not much of anything. Two weeks later, I got my state return in the mail by check. You tell me how this was considered an electronic filing and what the world did they even do for me. Nothing.
I downloaded my 1099 information from the internet. It came from the TD Ameritrade site. The date that the stock was sold was downloaded incorrectly. It was off by seven years. The date on the 1099 hard copy that I received in the mail was correct. I'm not sure if the download problem was a TD Ameritrade problem or a Turbo Tax problem. However, the Turbo Tax software did not notice that the sold date was 4 years before the purchase date. I think that this is a serious software problem. In addition, they calculated these sales as short term. I guess selling stock 4 years before you buy it is short term. When I ran the audit check, it found no problems with either the correct or incorrect dates. It said the probability that I would be audited was low in both cases.
Tried to claim against their guaranteed-highest-refund-or-your-money back. They overcalculated my state tax by $57. Searched for some time online before finally reaching a webform, only to find that my product (TurboTax Online Basic) is not listed. Neither is there an option for errors pertaining to 2008 - they only list 2007 and before. Used their online interactive Tina - it kept giving me completely unrelated answers. Did online chat and was told to call an 888 number. On their support page, they say hold times for calling in are 20 minutes. I called at 7:08 p.m. It is now 8:10 p.m. and I'm STILL HOLDING!!
Used TurboTax to file my joint tax return for my husband and I. It did not only miscalculate the rebate credit (I got rejected the first time for it), it also seems to have a major glitch when it transmits your return to the IRS. It says the AGI for the previous year (required to confirm your identity) that they automatically enter for you is incorrect and doesn't match IRS records. But it's not true. I called the IRS and it does match. So why is that TurboTax is screwing this up? I have been rejected by the IRS three times now and keep making the same correction per TurboTax instructions. It's telling me I have to file by mail. I feel it's a software glitch with Turbo and it's their fault, and yet they will not refund the $100 in fees I pad to file the returns. They screwed up and their product is essentially damaged, yet I still have to pay for it? How do they get away with keeping my money when the service didn't do what it was supposed to do? I will never ever again use Turbo Tax. I am not the only person to have this AGI rejection issue. I have seen dozens of others complain about it. Their customer service is horrible - no resolution. It seems clear it's their fault and yet they maintain it's the IRS's fault. Who can give us a recourse for this? I'm thinking of suing.
I tried to use TurboTax.com to prepare my tax return for 2008. After one rejection from their efile system. ther program would not let me make the correct amendments and re e-file. it made me pre-pay for documents to snail mail, then sent me documents to download that were full of errors, after I had already paid by credit card. They did not give me a chance to review the incorrect tax return forms. So I paid for a incorrect tax return. After waiting for more than 2 hours for there customer Service . I called my credit card and tried to stop the payment , or dispute the charge.After all the hipe of this service I expected a lot more. this was little more than a scam. I did my own return 1040EZ in less than 10 minutes. I will get back $461.00. TurboTax the first time gave me back over $1200 dollers. the next they said $611.00 dollers, but when they sent me the forms to mail in myselg they said I owe $600.oo . They made several mistakes. Including giving me a standard deduction of $11,900.00 when the correct standard is only $10,900.00 .?? Very disapointing. So far I have put in about 15 hours of work for this mess. At my current hourly wage that would be about $500.00. Not to mention the stress, and I am not sure of the IRS, because I had already filed a return(e-file) that they rejected. so it is still not over. Oh yes the dispute on my credit card is still not over. A long with this complaint. I have made a complanit sith the Better Bussiness Bureau.I have made copies of all documents on this problem.
I have used TurboTax since first release around 1989. I have always had good experience until this year. I tried installing on 4 different computers at 3 different locations. It won't download required updates and state tax module. Tried disabling firewall, pop-up blocker, virus protection and iTunes (which support recommended). Still didn't work. I called support and got download, which does the same thing. Updated by downloading the update file and installed, but TurboTax doesn't register the updates. Still can't download updates or the state. Obviously, Intuit is having major problems with software/servers this year, but won't be honest and admit it. God knows that might show sincerity of the company. Now it looks like they are trying to sell as much product as possible to sell the company.
I downloaded TurboTax 2008. When I tried to install, it would get started and just stop. I tried everything Intuit suggested and nothing has worked. I have tried both the premier and deluxe versions. Intuit just doesn't seem to get it that everyone is having the same problems. I have used their product for many years and now have switched to TaxCut simply because I can't wait for them to finally get it that there is a problem. Out the money for the product and time spent trying to solve the problem and delayed tax return.
I downloaded Turbo Tax Deluxe program. I received my order details and then printed them. I never received my installation code number. Without that I can't log on to a new tax program. I have spent 1.5 hours trying to answer all questions and giving all asked codes, sign on names, secret codes and so forth. I can't get Turbo Tax to answer back. Calling is a 45-minute wait and Indian speaking tech who I can't talk with just to give me a simple code. The Turbo Tax people did not send me an email receipt with the installation code on it. I'm trying to get the code from them without any help. They billed me twice also for one program. This is the first time I have had problems with Turbo Tax.
I've been trying to file my taxes through Turbo Tax for days now. I'm filing through the online service and the system freezes up when you're almost finished. You can't complete your taxes or receive your money. I have filed the last three years with no problem, so I'm shocked that they are having this issue for at least a week now.

I used Turbo Tax Deluxe to process my 2008 federal and state returns. After completing the returns, I clicked on e-file. Intuit asked me pay $19.95 via my credit card to e-file my state return. After entering my credit card info, Intuit accepted my payment and sent me a confirmation via email. However, at that point the program stalled and the state return never got filed. When I ran the program again, it picked up where I left off, except that it wants another $19.95 payment, even though I have an email from Intuit confirming my first payment. The program doesn't recognize that I already made my payment for the state return. From what I see on the message boards including Intuit's own website, many users are having the identical problem and can't get Intuit to acknowledge it.
I tried using their online service. I am unemployed with no income at this point. I need to file ASAP to save my truck from repo. I got my federal done and moved on to state and I am kicked off and asked to log in again. After about 4 hours of this and the assurance by their online chat support that the problem would be over in an hour, it was not. It ended up taking four hours to finish. When I tried to e-file, it's another two hours. After I e-filed successfully, it could not be saved. A week later, I need to talk to the Department of Treasury about an issue. Before they will talk to me, I need my adjusted household information. Because I could not print or save my return because of their online situation, I could not obtain the information I needed. I entered the online chat support. The person told me this is the first time in two years the site had problems. I told him that was not true. Instead of an apology, he decided to argue with me. I then told him it did not matter. I just needed help getting the information. He told me he could do nothing because the system was down. I told him that it was not right that I paid for this service and could not get my information. He then argued this was the first time in two years it went down. I asked for a supervisor and was told he did not have one. They have the worst customer service and system ever. I will never use it again.
I purchased TurboTax Deluxe on a CD. When trying to access the program, an update screen constantly intervened and then hung. We finally realized you could click down the update and proceed to the main program, but we still could not update from their online menu because the same updater would always intervene and then hang. My wife and I spent endless hours trying to make things work. We followed many links promising to contact TurboTax. These mostly led to articles that suggested we read (sounds like Microsoft - here, read our 2,000 articles from our Knowledge Base). I honestly can't say how we reached some page that allowed us to connect by email with a representative. The pages were changing in content from day to day. Finally, I demanded a URL of where I could update and mercifully received one. Now I can't download the free state return and am turning blue in the face. Nothing seems to work. In addition, it tells me I have downloaded the free state return, which is not true. I need a second state and after paying for it by credit card, could not download it either. As to the Federal return which we were finally able to update, we cannot file it because TurboTax says some of the needed forms are coming soon! I'm referring to the sale of residence form and worksheet. Can you imagine that? The form is coming soon. Obviously, TurboTax does not have their product ready. In the past years, it worked very well for us and we recommended it to everyone. This year I noticed that TurboTax loaded a lot of Microsoft programs onto our computer that made it into an SQL server (MS ASP.net 2.0). I found the components of this program from the panel and noticed that these components were loaded at the same time as TurboTax. Unlike other years, my computer is now a server to TurboTax. I am very suspicious of this from a privacy point of view. The presence of ASP.net 2.0 would go a long way towards explaining the change in character of this company. I am in the process of doing two state forms and part of my federal form by hand. I will never use TurboTax software again.
I would never recommend Turbo Tax to no-one. They are full of it. I was told they do taxes for free online then at the end they charge you a fee without any help on your taxes. This company needs to be shut down ASAP. I need my refund right away that is why I went online for the first time ever. And now I can't even get my refund I would have did better by mail.

I tried to save my returns in TurboTax as prompted and it is nowhere on my computer or they will not help me retrieve any of my information. The system kept booting me out and asking me to log in over and over again. The system kept going down while I was working on it. I have now filled my taxes with an estimated payment voucher on my Mississippi tax returns that I did not select. In fact, I am getting a refund on them. I am not able to retrieve my tax information now to amend them.
I have not been successful making contact with Intuit. The forms preparation went fairly well until I went through the check. The report came back that one of my charities had an incorrect address. It was not incorrect, but I was told that I could not file electronically. I have to file a paper form due to the incorrect address. I was forced to purchase the program with electronic filing, which I did not want. Now after being refused the electronic filing, I will file a paper form. I paid extra for nothing.
I purchased my software at Costco, which included federal free e-file and state e-file option of $19.95. I originally chose to mail in my state taxes, but after printing, the program says I can still e-file for only $19.95. I changed my mind and decided to e-file. After paying the additional $19.95, the program said that because my W2 was in error, I had to mail in my return. Apparently, my employer deducted 4 cents over the limit for CASDI. The program had all the numbers before it offered to e-file for $19.95. Intuit offers no refunds for any online sales. This was a $20 ripoff and I'm mailing in my return.
I filed my taxes a few weeks ago using TurboTax Deluxe online version. I checked the status of my refund yesterday and saw that the IRS deposited it to me on Jan. 30, 2009. Problem was there was nothing in my account. After many calls between the IRS and my bank, I found out what the issue was. When I put my information in for electronic deposit, it would not accept the routing number I was trying to use. I tried clip copy, and manually entering it - all with no avail. I thought that this must be the wrong number (I got it from my Bank of America in my account information) so I entered the other routing number they should. It was automatically accepted without issue. The number they accepted is only used for bank wires, not electronic deposit. After sorting everything out between my bank and the IRS, I contacted Intuit and asked for a supervisor right away. After telling her the story, she said I don’t see how it’s our fault. How is it not your fault when your program doesn't accept the numbers that I know are right but accepts the wrong ones? So now it’s going to take a few weeks for the IRS server to back up and see there was an issue with my return, then a few more weeks on top of that to mail me a hard check. I am unemployed due to the economic crisis and I could use this money to pay bills. I even explained that to the manager at Intuit and got the same answer she gave me before. Well besides being unemployed and need to pay bills, I guess the biggest issue is that I have spent at least 6 hours on the phone calling between the various groups to figure out what’s going on when I should be using that time to look for work.
TurboTax has software problems that prevent the product from working as promised. My 2008 return took only two hours to input but incorrectly flagged by TurboTax as unable to file electronically and must be mailed. When following the instructions to determine why the return could not be e-filed (error check), the software gets hung in a loop, perpetually updating. When I switched to another major e-file provider’s software, I was able to input and e-file with no problems, putting a lie to Intuit's suggestion that my computer may have connectivity issues. The true regret was the loss of many hours over 5 days wasting my time with this product.
This is the 3rd day in a row that I have attempted to sign in to Turbo Tax Online and I just get a message saying, "We are down but please come back shortly!" What in the world is going on?!
I purchased TurboTax 2008 Deluxe from Sam's Club for $50. I tried endlessly to get it to install. It would not install even with over 4 hours of tech support. They sent me a free download of the same program. After restarting in Safe Mode, checking all the required software and even taking my computer in to have a 1GB memory board installed, even though it says it has enough memory, TT08 will not install. Consequences: I purchased and installed 1GB of memory at $70 from Computer Revolution, spent no less than 6 hours on the phone with Intuit tech support. Personal hours of frustration about 10 hours. I returned the original program to Sam's Club for $50 refund.
I did my taxes at Turbotax.com and it went through but then it came back saying I put in the wrong AGI. I spoke with the IRS and I put the correct amount in the first time. Now I'm trying to fix it and nothing pops up for me to E-File it again. I have already paid my money for it and I need my return. I'm a single mom with two kids. I can't afford to pay huge amounts to someone to do my taxes. I went to this website thinking that they would be helpful and instead it has been a nightmare. You can't talk to anyone online and it takes forever to talk to someone on the phone. I just want my return back and for Turbo Tax to make themselves better!
I have attempted to complete the filing of 2008 taxes . The On line system has been down for day #2!!I started out receiving a rebate. to supposdly OWEING the IRS. I can not get back online to find the problem!! Of course I can't find a customer support phone number either. I am learning cutomer support is not a priority for this program I have hours trying to get back on line to continue the filing. NO SUCCESS! I guess I 'll go elsewhere
I have been trying for hours to get back into the online version of TurboTax 2009 and even if I get in, I enter all of the information on that page, hit Enter and it kicks me back out of the site. It now says, "Site down," but for hours? Come on! I finished everything and just need to get them filed. If it's a volume issue, that should have been born out through testing.
My husband and I filed our 2008 tax return on Jan. 16, 2009 through TurboTax. This is our (ongoing) story. Jan. 15, 2009: completed forms online, submitted to TurboTax to e-file, made payment to TurboTax for fees. Jan. 16, 2009: IRS receives tax forms, rejected due to duplicate SS# entry. We look over our forms, both hard copy as well as online, no errors. Re-submit 2008 return, accepted by IRS. Jan. 17, 2009: TurboTax submits another copy of our 2008 return without our permission or notifying us. The third return rejected! Jan. 18, 2009: Receive rejection emails from TurboTax but not one stating the accepted return. Was told our SS# was used on another return! Jan 20, 2009: In fear of ID theft, we contact SSA. No issues there. In total for this day, I spent 3 hours on the phone with SSA, the IRS as well as with TurboTax reps. The IRS told me that because of the phantom third return forms, our refund would be delayed for another week. Jan. 26, 2009: Called IRS for status check; TurboTax entered incorrect information on our return forms and will delay our refund another week! We went from refund arriving 1/31 to 2/3 now 2/10! I called a TurboTax rep; she said they would issue out a refund (but she never pulled up our account and verified nothing). Feb. 2, 2009: We called TurboTax to check status of refund for TT fees; there was no refund from TurboTax being processed! The last rep we spoke to did not process our request of a refund of fees! This rep gave us a confirmation number for our requested fees refund. Bottom Line: This has got to be, by far, the worst experience I have ever had to date with any business. TurboTax has handled our account as well as many other clients' accounts horribly. If TurboTax knew they were having glitches, why did they not send emails of apology and their actions to correct this error so many people are experiencing? Furthermore, why are they still accepting more clients to this day while TurboTax is still experiencing their glitches? Every time I called, the reps never gave me a straight answer or an apology for the huge screw up! They said one glitch. Let me count: 1. duplicate SS#, 2. phantom third return, 3. incorrect information entered on our e-file return, and 4. missing acceptance email. I believe that is 4 glitches not one. And don't forget the horrible customer service. I know I'm not the only one with this issue; I have read many comments in the TT Community Boards. TurboTax has just lost a client.
Install program on TurboTax was faulty and would not install. Quicken 2009 would update me info checks as far back as 1999.
Using TurboTax Premier online. Import of Schedule D information from brokerage (in my case, E*Trade) does not work, so relevant information (purchase date and cost basis) must still be researched on brokerage website and then entered by hand on Intuit's TurboTax site. Upgrading from Deluxe to Premier online edition is a waste of money ($20 difference) if just done for the investment sale information import. I called Intuit today, was in the music loop for 10 minutes, then 20 minutes on the phone with a very friendly but completely helpless representative. They couldn't log on to their own system at the time, so she assured me I'd get a refund but to call back in a few days. Yeah right! I spent 36 minutes on the phone... nothing.
I used 2008 Fed/State software version as I have done in previous years. The Missouri State Income Tax version for 2008 is using 2007 forms/rules. When it comes to Property Tax rules, the law changed in Missouri for 2008. Therefore, we are being denied a refund of $1,100.00. It is if we continue using TurboTax. If we don't use the TurboTax program purchased, we are out some $42.00. We are trying to make contact and the feedback is we're waiting for the state to approve the forms. I went to the Missouri website and the forms have been in place for some months now. I feel TurboTax is giving me the runaround. If this cannot be corrected before April 15, I will have to purchase the software from H&R Block.
I purchased turbotax delux program online at January 31,2008 Saturday and I gave my credit card information, then I downladed your program. But when I check my bank acccount online I saw that you charged me three times $63.55 instead of one.You charged me $127.10 for nothing. I already inform my bank. Please correct that action and explain me why you charged me in that way.
I tried to file with this horrid garbage of a program tonight, and I did everything right. However, when I got to the error checker portion of the walk through it, says I have one error. When I go to correct it, it just keeps loading and then the site crashes. I do not have a connectivity issue, my internet runs fine (I am a network specialist) so I don't believe the Intuit BS spin. The site and program is buggy and rather than being lazy and try to blame it on customers’ internet connection, how about you either fix your terrible program or hire more people to answer the phone for help. I sat on the hold for over an hour, an hour and 25 minutes to be exact! It's 9pm here in Michigan and they don't close till 9pm Pacific Time, so that is just unacceptable. I never once talked to anyone, that’s an hour and 25 minutes I sat there. I have other things to do than sit on the phone all night. I will tell everyone to avoid this program and that if you have a problem, TurboTax (Intuit) won’t help you. I've already been in 2 forums I frequent where people have asked if TurboTax is any good. Intuit better realize bad word of mouth is not what they want associated with their product.
On January 27th I attempted to file my taxes online through TurboTax's website. The website crashed roughly 10 times and I kept having to re-enter my information, and finally got to the end to file. The site then went down again and though I tried for 30 minutes, I kept getting an MSQL database error so I gave up for the night. The next day, I logged on and the site seemed to be working okay. The system picked up right where I left off, telling me I just needed to file. When I clicked file, it asked me to re-enter my credit card information (though I did yesterday) and already had the charge on my online banking statement. After sending two emails and receiving responses stating that I wasn't charged, I finally placed a phone call. After 5 phone calls of people who didn't know what they were talking about and transferring me all over the place, I finally received someone who said he would issue a credit and to just re-process everything all over again.
Jerry of Canaan, CT, I believe you are referring to line 12 (not line 11). Regardless, we have not been able to find any exceptions for this area. Amounts entered on line 12 with code "D" properly generate the correct result. Nothing suggests that TurboTax is generating anything with an IRA. Perhaps, you can doublecheck your entries. Thanks.
I attempted to download Basic TurboTax Edition and got error 65535. I tried all of the online support stuff and got nowhere. I called the online support and never got anywhere with long waits and disconnects. I did see on the back that they will take back the purchase within 60 days with receipt. Well, guess what? I have bought this product for over 10 years and didn't retain my receipt. So I am out $30.00. Don't buy TurboTax!
I had a problem with my tax information going through correctly and I had to pay $50. For this now I'm in the process with amending my returns because Turbotax system had a glitch in their system.
I am done with TurboTax. Their proclaimed Award Winning Support is the worst. I purchased the TurboTax Home/Business for $101.52 from Wal-Mart. I installed the software, put my information into the program and made it to the point Download State. I walked through all the windows until I came to the click Continue to Download. The program froze. I waited for an hour. I closed the download window and it crashes the whole program. Then a window comes up Checking for Solutions. After a few minutes of looking at that window, it comes up with a window, Cannot find Solution. I have called six times. I emailed. No one can tell me how to fix it. They just keep passing me from one person to another while I wait on hold for over 45 minutes each time. I was hung up on three times. I have spent endless hours where I could have done my taxes for free by hand. I will never purchase TurboTax again. I am done!
I tried to buy TurboTax Deluxe edition for 2008 and was unsuccessful downloading it. I tried for hours to solve the problem including trying all of their online troubleshooting tools and tips. None worked. I couldn't get their contact tree on their website to work. It wouldn't allow me to get to the part where you can actually choose to chat or send an e-mail for help. I finally tried to get a refund by using the link from my purchase confirmation e-mail, and it didn't work either. There was a phone number listed there; however, so I called thinking great, finally, I'll get to talk to a person and get my problem solved or a refund. No such thing. I was stuck in a telephone tree and even though they said if I pressed zero I would get an operator, it just put me back through the tree. I'm so completely fed up! What can I do to cancel my order other than call my credit card company to deny payment? This download/install problem that seems to have to do with a software compatibility or problem with TurboTax and its need for Microsoft.net framework seems to be prevalent from the blogs online. What a horrid experience.
On 1/21/09, I uncovered a software error in Turbo Tax Deluxe. When entering W-2 information into Box 11 code D - this is the code for 401K contributions - the software automatically populates the tax form as an IRA contribution. I explained to the service person that if some people do not catch this software error, it may cost them hundreds. The service person's response is that Turbo Tax does daily software updates to correct such issues. I explained that this problem could / would immediately affect many customers. She became frustrated. I asked to speak to a supervisor - I hung up after 20 minutes. Beware!
I was charged $94.85 to file a FREE Efile Fed and State Tax Return. Also, after receiving a confirmation email showing my infomation was received by Fed and State, Turbo Tax still wants me to complete my return and Efile again. Spent hours on the phone with several intut Turbo Tax reps which took note of my past years FREE file, and could only explain by saying, I must have purchased something? The $94.85 charge for FREE Efile represents about 1/4 of my total refund.
I filed my 2006 and 2007 taxes using TurboTax. I've had to pay an extra $3,000 to federal and an extra $70 to NY state, all due to errors in TurboTax software. Why is it these people can get away with tax fraud and nothing gets done when a normal American citizen would end up with huge fines, restitution and jail time? Another case of big business sticking it to Americans with the government that's supposed to be for the people sitting back and doing nothing. My plant went on strike and I, after a year on unemployment, subsequently had to take a new job that pays a lot less than I was making. I'm a kidney transplant patient with a disabled roommate. This has put a huge strain on our finances because we trusted TurboTax to make sure we were putting enough away so the tax payment wouldn't hurt us financially. No such luck. We are still receiving notice from the government that we owe money, even after we thought we'd paid what we owed, even after subsequent payments. When is this nightmare going to stop? Why isn't TurboTax responsible?
The 1908 TurboTax file form won't come up. I finally got the info sheet up, but you can't type on it. You can go to forms and you might as well go outside and ask for it. It doesn't respond. Could someone contact me on my phone? I have been a customer for at least 10 years.
I filed my 2007 taxes using TurboTax 2007. I also have been using it to calculate my 2008 estimated taxes. It seemed quite easy and I calculated and paid the amounts on time. But here at year-end as I look over my tax records and such, something looked wrong, very wrong. So I went back and re-calculated my estimated taxes myself using the 1040ES worksheet. Wow, TurboTax was off by almost 50%! Count me among the screwed. I've now got to come up with over $30,000 by January 15. I have it but it sure would have changed my financial planning over the year, especially in light of the economic situation. I am also now sweating an audit. Everything on my returns was legitimate but given that the program has proven it cannot do simple addition and subtraction, who knows how much I may have underpaid? In fact, I'm going to have to go back and re-do my entire 2007 return to make sure I didn't grossly overpay. If that's the case, I'll have to file an amended return (and hope the it). This is a ton of work on top of the financial implications. What a horrible, horrible product.
I downloaded TurboTax 2008. It appeared to install; however, screen came up showing unexpected and serious error. I called for assistance and he reported it to higher level. I received an e-mail saying problem was solved and to download again. Same result. I called another TT Tech for assistance. He simply decided to send me a backup CD. With that, I installed it on my desktop but arrived to the same problem. I tried loading on my laptop and got the same problem. I've used TurboTax since version 1 (1989/1990) without any problem. I'm thinking of changing now. Reluctantly. I would prefer a solution.
I received notice from IRS that ‘07 taxes prepared that used TurboTax resulted in an error and $1,600+ was due by April 15th. It seems my 1099 was entered correctly initially but not carried over per IRS explanation. How do I file against TurboTax? This has been most upsetting and embarrassing besides expensive. Is there a joint suit underway? Thanks.
TurboTax 2005 messed up my Massachusetts tax return. They put my Federal wages in place of my state wages. It also failed to add a 1099 form that was entered. I have called them and am going through the claim process but have not heard from them in the stated time that they indicated that they would get back to me.
Was shipped Turbo Tax 2009. Used it in the past, but no more. Circumstances changed. Was billed late November for $64.15. Called credit card company. Was told to contact Intuit. Credit card company gave me phone number. Called several times, got automatic customer service electronic messaging. During 5th phone call, kept punching 0 on phone until it gave up and put me through to a person. Told rep I had been talking to machines up until I got her; she responded, "You're quite the joker", and hung up. Called again, put on hold over 20+ minutes until Intuit hung up on me. Called another number (1-800-440-3279) I found on net. Went straight through to a living human! She said she cancelled the account (that I didn't ask for) and would refund the charge. Got a confirmation email to that effect. I'll see what happens next with the credit card company.
No Customer Service telephone number available. TurboTax did not send my completed return to the IRS. It was completed before the stimulus check deadline and I missed the deadline because they never sent it. I am very upset. I saw that this has happened to others as well.
I fell victim to an embedded scheme in Turbo Tax that offers gift cards to restaurants at a discount with the cost being deducted from your refund. I bought two Starbucks $50 cards and two Red Lobster $50 gift cards and allowed Intuit to deduct $100 from my refund. The cards were not delivered because they required a signature for delivery and arrived while I was away. They were returned to Intuit. I have tried for two years to find someone at Intuit Customer Service that will respond with anything other than that offer has expired. I don't have a problem with the software, but these guys must have the worst customer service I ever experienced. Their 800 line puts you on hold for 30 minutes minimum and once you speak to someone, they don't seem to know what you are talking about. I rate Intuit as a D- vendor and refuse to buy their products. Consumer beware!
2005 Tax Return audited by the state of Mass. That year I worked for part of the year in CT. Wages did not transfer from Federal return to MA return for wages earned in CT. Taxes owed to the state of MA $2000 with $300 penalty. I didn't catch error, I trusted the software. I should at least have the cost of the service reimbursed and any -penalty. Unfortunately, customer service doesn't exist.
In November of 2008, I received a letter from Massachusetts Dept. of Revenue stating that an audit of my 2005 tax return resulted in us owing the state of Mass. additional money plus the interest accrued since 2005. I am a resident of Mass. but I work in Rhode Island. When filling-out my Mass. tax return, TurboTax did not include my Rhode Island income from my W2 in the Wages of the Mass. state tax forms. Upon receiving the audit letter from the Mass. Dept. of Revenue, I spoke with a representative on the phone and was told that my Rhode Island income must be claimed as wages and then a credit is given later in the form. How does TurboTax not know this????? Now I am responsible for the tax on those wages from 2005 PLUS INTEREST because there is no way to contact TurboTax and hold anyone accountable! I have since used TurboTax in 2006 and 2007 and wonder if this problem occurred on those tax returns as well? I certainly hope that TurboTax would have corrected such a glaring mistake on their part. I do not know if they did, but wouldn't be surprised if they did not. I am lucky that I do not bring in much money to my household, but for others who reside in Mass., and work out-of-state, this situation could be devastating, especially with the interest payments. TurboTax should be held accountable for this mistake. Period. I hope I will be contacted by some lawyer or firm who takes on the injustice of this situation!
I filed my taxes on 9/12/08 and paid the amount in full to the IRS as indicated by Turbo Tax. Apparently the software calculated the penalties and taxes wrong and we really owe another $5K. We purchased their Audit Defense service, but they can't help us b/c it is a Turbo Tax issue. We can't find any contact information for Turbo Tax to contact them. They guarantee on their website to take responsibility for any miscalculated fees etc, but how the heck do you get a hold of them. I will tell you how, I am contacting every news and media outlet that will listen to me! What a fraud!
Once you have subscribed to TurboTax, they never stop debiting your account, even after you cancel your subscription. The only way to keep them out of your checking account is to cancel the debit card and get a new one. Banks will only block for 6 months at a time, then it starts up again.
I filed correctly. Turbo Tax even had the correct figures when I printed including my estimated Stimulus refund amount. What Turbo Tax sent to the IRS was totally inaccurate. Turbo Tax added a Schedule B which stated my dividends double my gross income. Ultimately, IRS says I owe them over $17,000. I did not receive a stimulus check. IRS apologized and recalculated my stimulus and said I am due a stimulus in the amount of $37. Now I have to go through the IRS to create an amended 2007 return which will finally result in my refund. I then have to separately dispute the calculation of my stimulus based on the amended 2007 return. The anticipated time for all this to be correct will be well into the second quarter of 2009. If this is not correct my 2009 return will be in jeopardy as well. No thank you Turbo Tax. I will never use them again. There need to be a class action lawsuit against these fools.
No Customer Service telephone number available. Turbo Tax did not send my completed return to the IRS. It was completed before the stimulus check deadline and I missed the deadline because they never sent it.
TurboTax claims that they will cover errors in taxes due to defects in their product, yet, they offer no way for their customers to contact them without giving out additional credit card information. We were audited due to defective Turbo Tax software. It is a very low quality product.
Intuit warranties the accuracy of their software and sells audit defense provided by a subcontractor. By accuracy, they mean that the software can add 2 & 2 to get 4. However, getting the right numbers in the right slots does not seem to be part of the warranty. Purchasing the audit defense is a waste of time and money. If any question arises from your online tax form submission, the company providing the service will not recognize your audit defense account in time to do any good. Turbo Tax help services are focused on deflecting all criticisms, not solving problems.
I purchased TurboTax for Home & Business 2007 at Costco in February. I have used TT since 2001 for Macintosh. It wouldn't open properly on my iMac so I called TT Home & Business Tech Support and described what was happening to Robert, their technician. He didn't know what the TT icon to click on to open the application was. He started making jokes on the $3.99 per minute line and when I asked to speak to someone who WAS familiar with the H&B program, he said how was he supposed to earn any money if he transferred my call to someone else? I said maybe the disk was defective so he finally gave me another number to call. Tech Support was a total waste of time. That number was an 800 number to India, and the guy told me I needed to upgrade my OS system but I would still need the TT updates. I can't download programs online because I live in ten miles from town on rural farmland and have analog phone lines that are staticky with poor modem speed requiring 7-12 hours for a 40K download and the connections fail after a few minutes. My CD didn't have the final updates to tax laws so I called the phone number provided on the CD to order them on CD via the company automated phone system when they were to shipped, according to Intuit in late March. The recorded message said I would receive them within 14 days of finalization. I didn't have them by April 15th, so I filed an extension, and called again. Two weeks later, I still didn't have them. I kept trying until Sept. 9 to get the updates from Intuit. Finally, I got a friend to download them with his high-speed connection, but the program is not inputting information correctly. There is no one alive to talk to at Intuit/TurboTax, for all their guaranties and audit defense.
I purchased TurboTax Online. I am unable to print my taxes. I have tried to contact someone at TurboTax to explain that the program will not allow me to print my taxes. I keep getting an error message. I need someone to contact me, so I can resolve this issue. I need to print my taxes and my form 8453 OL. Please help me with this problem.
File 2007 Federal and multi state taxes on-line. The very last steps before filing electronically I had to provide information for my bank account, routing, and the date for debit. For the state that I owed I input 10/03/2008 for debit date and send it electronically. To my extreme surprise and shock the debit was done on 09/15/2008. It just cleaned out my account and I ended up with a negative balance and unpaid bills plus all the bank fees. This prompted me to look at my tax return online and the PDF file I downloaded. Both were clearly having the debit date as 09/10/2008. I contacted Intuit via InstantService chat and presented them with the problem and asked if they can simply verify that maybe the program is placing the filing date in the place of the debit date or maybe there is a mapping issue. As a software engineer and dealing with computers for over 15 years I have come to accept that computers do not make mistake, it is the instruction (garbage in, garbage out). I am disappointed that the customer service is not willing to take ownership of the issue and passing it on to technical support. When are the companies going to modify their existing model of having customer do the leg work for their lack of interest. This has cost well over $535 to date and more to come excluding the shame of having returned checks due to this problem.
Their software misrepresented my family situation to the IRS by leaving my two daughters off my U.S. return (although they did correctly list them on my state one), resulting in a lowered refund and a lowered Economic Stimulus Payment amount. I had never used the program before and never will again. They really screwed up my summer, financially speaking. I then filed an amended return through TurboTax, which they also completely miscalculated. And now the IRS tells me that because I did not know to write a note in my amended return asking that my stimuls $ be recalculated based on my amended return, I now will not get that $600 until sometime in 2009, if then. But my biggest complaint is their completely poor communication. Just now I tried to contact them again, because they have never responded to my emails, and there is NO WAY to contact the company with a letter, I mean, there is NO contact address of either the snail mail or electronic mail variety.
I used TurboTax I was audited And owed 3000 + It messed up on our 401K. It added it twice .We ended up with $200. dollar penalty.I contact but no responce. That has been over 2 months They were suppose to pay the penalty $200 dollars
I filled my federal taxes with turbo tax deluxe on line, march 2007. there was a typo error on line 38 form 1040 that no one caught. because of the error I was refunded 10 x the amount which totalled to thousands of unbelievable dollars. soneone other than myself, should be accountable.
In 2006 I was entering a W2 information. The wages were 3,000. For the federal taxes, instead of 30.00, I erroneously entered 3,082. This caused me to have over 3,000 of undue refund. The program SHOULD NEVER HAVE ALLOWED A TAX ENTRY AMOUNT THAT IS GREATER THAN THE WAGES AMOUNT In 2008, the IRS requested repayment with interests. Where would I get that money, specially during these hard times?
Filed for my economic stimulus schedule J on SSI with Turbotax, intuit all the IRS offered for SE online! (Why is a private company using public webstie?) Wanted my $300 check. Only income is a 600 a month SSI check. Because it seems I didn't shell out a 9.95 to file a state of Calif. tax they "misplaced" my federal income tax form. I receive nothing!
I have used turbo tax for yrs now and this year, not only did I have to pay the IRS It kicked out my kids and I got nothing for them. so now im out 1700.00 plus 600.00 for my kids. The Irs wont help me and they say they never heard of this turbo tax mess up. i tried contacting Turbo Tax and they are not answering the phone. My husband is not working and he has been behind in his child support and my stimulus check was depleted by them taking out the owed money. I am having trouble with my bills and was looking forward to my kids stimulus to help me out.
I WILL NEVER USE TURBO TAX AGAIN! I used it this year and they really messed me up on my stimulus return and quite possibly my mom's social security checks. I filed with them and they have my mom as a dependent. I filed with them last year and didn't use her as a dependent and I also claim no dependents on my paycheck. I don't know how they got her name on there at all. She can not be a dependent being on social security. This is her own income. Where they got her name I have no idea. I didn't even know turbo tax did it till I called to find out about my stimulus check. My brother typed one thing and didn't even see them do that. They have me making 3,000 more than I actually did. Called IRS and they were no help. Found out I couldn't get direct deposit even though I got my checks that way. On the state form they have what I made, but on the federal form they have me making 3,000 more...where did that number come from? We entered all the information exactly like they said to do, and this is the resault. According to the IRS I only paid 11.00 in taxes so I get 300.00 while everyone else seems to be getting 600.00. We called to get it figured out and the IRS guy both times was rude. He told my mom that her and me and my brother (who filed the taxes) are all going to jail and they could take away my mom's social security that it took her 4 1/2 years to get. She has glacomma and is almost completely deaf and needs her social security. I called 3 weeks ago and no one ever got back to me and I called again today...nobody can answer any questions there. I don't know what to do. I really needed that money, meanwhile borowing from everybody I know just to put gas in my car to go to work. But they screwed me on my stimulus check, they very well have maybe screwed mom on her social security and check, they are saying what we did was fraud, even though we didn't know it happened and the guy at IRS said you could go to jail. They have caused a lot of stress, financial problems and lot of emotional pain.
Turbo Tax dropped a dependant we filed for the last 10 years. I transfer information over every year for the last 10 years using Turbo Tax. For some reason, this year it dropped a dependant (son) I have claimed since he was born. This effected not only my federal return, but it also effected my stimulus check and State return. When talking to Turbo Tax about this, they claim they no nothing about any problems with their software. Way to help out this year Turbo Tax. Federal Taxes were wrong. Stimulus check was wrong and Maryland State taxes were wrong.
i filed my income tax on line with them and they said i would recevie a refund of 278.oo that april 14 th and i have not receive anything.
This was my first year filing independently on my taxes (I'm a student). I decided to file my 2007 taxes very early(back in February) using Turbo Tax. I filed electronically, and I was told that I would be recieving $460 back. I followed every step precisely and the Turbo Tax website told me that my returns were accepted. Fast forward to nearly 4 months later!!! I still haven't recieved my refund and I called the IRS to check the status. They told me that Turbo Tax never sent them anything and I'm not even on file! The Turbo Tax website still says that everything is correct. I tried contacting them and they don't even have a phone number listed. I dug around until I found a number and the hotline told me that their offices are closed, and that I should call back Mon-Fri 8am-5pm. Today is Tuesday and it's 10 am!! I am a college student, and I am extremely broke. I have never done my own taxes before, so I wasn't sure how long the process would take. But now that I know I should have recieved it long ago, I am nervous that my refund will be lost in a sea of everyone else's returns.
I entered my account number correctly for direct deposit and this is proven in the fact that I recieved my state return by direct deposit with no problems. However, my Fed return was supposed to be in my account today and wasn't. When I looked into everything, I found that though I had triple checked my acct number, they had some kind of glitch in ther system and the acct number was filled in incorrectly. I tried to contact their tech support and their customer service and could not get a soul. Now, because one number is in error, we will not be getting our return, instead it will be returned to the IRS by my bank and we will be waiting another month for a paper check. Our roof is near falling in and we needed that money badly. Now it looks as if we may suffer irreperable financial damage because of their erroneous software. The worst part is that there is seemingly nothing I can do-Turbo Tax will more than likely ignore my complaint, my bank will not keep the payment in house, I cannot stop wind or rain, and any money I have to put out outside of my return will put us behind on bills-which means no electric,no communications, no gas, and extra fees for late payments, etc. This is a nightmare to us-THANKS A LOT TURBO TAX!!! YOU HAVE COMPLETELY SCREWED US!!!We will most definately be using something different for 2008! Would Turbo Tax like to explain to my children why we have to leave our home because half the roof has caved in? Or maybe they tell my creditors why I'm late on my payments...yeah-it'll never happen-we should all boycott this company and make sure everyone else knows about their shady practices, and the IRS should investigate them as well-who knows maybe we're all due a bigger refund. Whatever the case, Turbo Tax definately owes all of us something for our headaches!
I just received an email from Turbo Tax saying that my stimulus check will be mailed to me, this happened on the day I thought it would have been direct deposited. Turbo Tax even asked me if I wanted it to be direct deposited or sent by mail. I will never use Turbo Tax again!!! It appears that my check will be mailed to me in late JULY!!! So, I'm going to have plenty of time to stew over this and the fact that I feel like I've just been ripped off by Turbo Tax. As far as I can tell the IRS will not even let you update your direct deposit information, so all you can do is wait..wait.. wait.. !!! BAD Turbo Tax!!
Today Friday May 16th I received an email from turbo tax stating that i will not get my tax rebate through direct deposit even though that's how i received my tax return mid February. But rather i will receive it in the mail because i used part of my tax return to pay for the Turbo tax fee. And rather then receiving my rebate money TODAY FRIDAY MAY 16TH I should expect a check in the mail BY JULY 11. I was so angry because i really needed that money and had made plans with that money. What made me the most angry was not that Ill be receiving my money in the mail but that TURBO TAX waited until today to let me know of this. Couldn't they have told me this a month ago, or a week ago or even yesterday. To wait the last minute really says a lot about how they really feel about their customers. I do my taxes, my parents taxes and my cousins too through Turbo tax and I will never ever use them again. Thanks for nothing Turbo TAX.
This year turbotax has caused millions of consumers such as myself to have tax rebate checks delayed. Turbotax showed the IRS that I did a RAL with them even though I only had filing fees deducted from my refund and did not do a rapid refund. I could kick myslef for using them this year after what they did to me last year too. I filed my state taxes on Aoril 17 and their system crashed so many people did not have thier returns processed. Turbotax never notified me, I only found out when after waiting for for state refund I called and my state showed no refund filed even though I had a confirmation from turbotax. Turbotax advised me to resubmit, which I did. Then the state deducted $50 late fee from my refund, which turbotax to this day has refused to pay, even though I had a confirmation and cited the so called warranty. I wont be a fool three times you can bet! $50 late fee, and stress levels though the roof...anger over inability to get rebate due to turbotax
In 2006 I filed my taxes with TurboTax and it was the first year I itemized my tax return so I didn't notice when TurboTax erroneously entered a dollar amount in the pre-paid taxes line. I didn't think it was correct, but trusted the software and filed it as TurboTax calculated it. There is no way I would trust their product again. Ended up owing taxes instead of receiving a small rebate and paying hundreds of dollars in penalties. Spent hours on the phone with TurboTax and making copies to take advantage of their accuracy guarantee. They told me it was an entry error so quickly there was no way they investigated it for me.
We used 2007 Turbo Tax to file this year, and paid for direct deposit. Turns out that anyone that used Turbo Tax this year will not get their stimulus refund direct deposited, but they have to wait for the checks! I have to wait till JULY now to get my stimulus refund. VERY misleading. This is going to cost me a lot in fees, because I planned on it being here!
I have used Turbo Tax and Tax Cut off and on for years. This year's Turbo Tax was the worst ever and I will NEVER use it again. After efiling with Turbo Tax in order to more quickly receive the rebate being issued by the government this year, and to have it directly deposited, I found that this is not possible with Turbo Tax! Your rebate amount is not able to be directly deposited if you specifically use the Turbo Tax software and pay taxes you owe from your checking account (electronically submitted.) I called the IRS regarding the lack of deposit of said rebate, and the above answer is what I received. How weird is this!? Of course, Turbo Tax sent a ridiculous email trying to explain itself, but the long and short of it is that it would appear that Turbo Tax will mislead their customers in order to make even the smallest profit ($17.00 fee!) I certainly would have never efiled owing the government money if I had known the truth of the situation - their software even asks you if you want the rebate to go direct deposit or by check. Shame on Turbo Tax for this unscrupulous behavior all for the lousy $17.00 efile fee. If they didn't do this on purpose, they apparently don't know what they should know about the tax business. I teach at a community college that uses Turbo Tax with their accounting program. You can bet my colleagues and students will know about this experience. Tax Cut next year. Now I have a check coming to an address that may not be attended at that time, in a very populated area, and unscrupulous neighbors!
I have used TurboTax for four years. Last week, April 2007, I received a letter from the IRS saying that My 2008 return did not report most of my income, my entire pension was missing. I tried to gete a copy odf my 2006 file and got nothng byt code gibberish. It had been recorde inan MDI file which I don't have and costs a bfundle to gete. I have triedf every weay to get a phone number. Got one and called a tech person who gave me bad inforemaetion and got a bill fdrom the Geek company. Went to the iRS and got a teranscriipt whch showed Income reported from pension as 43,000. Taxable income was less than this and was unreeporterd. I ran ererore check several teimes before I filed. Turbo should have caught this discrepancey. I gdot a 9,000 rerefdund which I now have to pay back along wieth 3,000 in fines and inteerest. This has to be TEurbo's faut, but I can[t find anyway to get through to them. I WILL NEVER USE TURBO AGAIN AND i WILL ADVISE EVERYONE I KNOW NOT TO USE ITE EITHER. iT IS INTEREESTING THAT THE ONLY FILE i NEEDED WAS ETHE ONE THAT GOT RECORDE IN mdi IN CODE. iT COST ME3,000 TO GETE RIPPED OFF. i DON'T OBJECT TO PAYING THE TAX. i OWWED IT. sORERY ABOUT THE BAD TYPING. i HAVE HAD BAD HAND SURGERY. 3,00.00 IN PENALTIES AND INTEREST
TuboTax is misleading and we will never use them again. We purchased the software to efile and paid extra to get our tax return money direct deposit. Well, I called the IRS today and they stated that anyone who did this will have to wait to get their stimulus rebate until mid June. This was not clearly explained when we started doing our taxes with Turbo Tax! Turbo Tax's Santa Barbe bank will get to use our stimulus rebate for a month before we all get our money that's ours. Shady! I'll never get Turbo Tax again! They're holding our money that's ours.
My 2007 Taxes were no unlike many other years I filed with Turbotax electronically due to the ease and convienence. Unfortunately there is an error in their process. They require you when making your taxe payment to put the date of filing as your payment date. In this case it was 4/15 because I filed at 5:00pm on 4/15. Normally this wouldnt be an issue, however they accepted my taxes on the 15th and didnt process them till the 17th this made that date of payment before the filing date. This caused my taxes to be rejected. I did get an email stating they were rejected on the 6th of may. 3 Weeks later! The customer support people I spoke to said that we are not tax professionals and that I would have to contact my state office. So basically I spent well over $100 dollars to get 3rd rate shaky service from TurboTax. I feel ripped off. Because of this I have been on the phone with Turbotax and the state all day. Turbo tax gave me no suppport and I asked if they were going to pay my penaltie for being late they said that would be my responsibility. What used to be the premier tax service on and software has screwed me. Appearently many people as a quick review online would find. My state office was nice at least and told me to send all the supporting facts in with my return and they would look at them and let me know what my penalty would be.
We used TurboTax to do my taxes this year. We input all the information and e-filed both federal and state. Got my refund on both electronically. when we got our stimulus rebate it was for only 1200.00 instead of 1500.00, 300.00 for our daughter. Went back and looked at my return we discovered that even though we entered all my daughters info in, TurboTax did not put her on our forms therefore not only did we lose the 300.00 rebate but we lost our deduction for 2007. Trying to contact TurboTax now but like all the other folks on here we have been unsuccessful. I can see by reading all these complaints we are screwed but maybe if we all got together and filed a class action suit maybe we could get some satisfaction. I dont know how much more of a refund we would have gotten back with my daughter addeed into our return but I for sure know that we are out 300.00 on the stimulus check.
This year my family filed our taxes using TurboTax. It was sent to the IRS through my system electronically (e-filed) and direct deposited to our account. Now I'm being told instead of receiving our tax stimulus refund by direct deposit on May 9th according to SS#. We will not be receiving this until the end of June in the mail by paper check. Almost 2 months later! I would like to know why nobody was informed of this for tax payers who use TurboTax. This is not mentioned any where and I and very upset and feel very mislead. This money was going to be used for a family vacation! Now that vacation had to be put on hold.
TuboTax is misleading. We purchased the software to efile, had to pay again to efile, along with a fee to receive a refund and pay taxes owing. It cost us double, because we purchased the software. And now we find that because we e-filed with Turbo Tax, our stimulus rebate will not be direct deposited, but rather sent by check in mid-June. They say the IRS is responsible, but this was not clearly explained when we started doing our taxes. TurboTax should be investigated and taken off the list of approved efilers with the IRS. The result is that the Bank of Santa Barbara gets to use our Stimulus Rebate for more than a month before it sends us a check. They are making quite a profit on this deal.
I purchased Turbo Tax Basic. Called Phone number as instructed to get final updates 5 times, never received anything. Finally I had to print out my forms near 4/15/08 and all over all the pages in huge green letters Form not final do not submit. At the last minute I had to do my taxes by hand without knowing whether I had final forms or not. I will never buy this product again
I have dealt with Turbo Tax for several years. This past year (2007) was a nightmare of problems. 1)We received the program and started on Tax's, we starting filling Tax's begining of Feb and after sending in Taxs we find out that the program we were using was not up to date which has caused alot of problems since. Why are they sending the product out before it is ready to use, I had been on line several times before we filed why did they let this go thru causing problems and refuned being held up. 2) Now this is coming back again with the new tax break, because Irs did not get the entire work sheet section V with banking info now its holding the check up and being sent out. All Turbo Tax is doing is make up things and not trying to find out whats happening. 3) 1 Month ago I was sent the entire amount back because of there problem's but it doesnot make up for the damages they have caused. This is a big problem as I can see and nobody is doing a thing about it.Turbo should pay fee's for there mistake.
I am disgusted with Turbo Tax not informing their clients that they were not going to get their stimulus check direct deposited into their acct unless they used a credit card to process it. Like many other consumers I was counting on that money to help me get ahead in these trying times. Now I have to wait until June 20th. I have recommended Turbo Tax to many people and I will call each and everyone of them to let them know why they will not be getting a direct deposit into their accts. I will never use them again nor should anyone else because to send out an e mail to their clients to let them know was obviously asking a bit much.
I used turbo tax from a web page that said it was a free service, when i was done it cast about $100. I was under the impression that it was a direct deposit, Now that i am expecting my stimulus tax package it has to be sent by check and I won't recieve it till the end of june. I am sure many other people will find this out the hard way also. turbotax is not free, it is misleading. I had budget my month expecting my stimulus package to be direct deposited by the irs time table
Trying to print a copy of my 2007 Federal and State Tax returns. The Turbo-Tax 'support center' does not provide any support, nor am I able to print these forms. I have went to their webiste numerous times. I purchased their software prior to filing my tax returns. Now I cannot print any of these forms. Need these forms for a Chapter 7 Bankruptcy in process.
We want to be able to contact Turbo Tax / Intuit some way. We cannot seem to get any response from their website from e-mail, tech support and no phone available. Maybe it is a problem with our computer or with our lack of expertise -- but the point is, we cannot find a mailing address or phone number to contact them. We keep being referred to the support website which does not respond like it should. The Tax software would not take our file to send electronically and kept requesting that we enter the correct phone number -- which had been downloaded from last year and had not changed. We are sure the same thing will happen again if we use Turbo Tax next year. How to contact a phantom company that takes our money and goes away? Many hours of frustration and work on the computer trying to correct what was happening. At this point I think the software disc had a glitch. So we had to file by snail mail and will experience delays on our state return as well as a much later Federal tax rebate thing than if we had been successful with electronic filing. I don't want anything legal except to get them to be accessible for problems and complaints!
have filed tax using Turbox tax and the Federal and state accepted the return . I Owe tax and I initiated direct debit from my account , the funds are not deducted from my account. By using Turbo tax in 2005 , they calculated wrong and paid penatly for 2005. I will not use Turbo tax and I should file for cosumer fraud .. They should refund the tax penalty ..... I will not recommend Turbo tax... Thanks
Bought TurboTax after a rep told me it would import all information from my previous year H&R TaxCut. Turbo imported only half of the info, and messed up Schedule D, which was transferred with a negative value. After I had E-filed, I noticed it and called the company. I got Turbo tax rep on the line in five minutes, but it was someone in India. I could barely understand him and he knew nothing about Schedule D in America. Not good, Folks. I had to file an Amendment to correct the mistake in Sch D, which I did by hand to verify Turbotax output.
On 4/15/2008, I filed my taxes electronically with Intuit's Turbo Tax only to find out that my filing was rejected by the IRS because my Adjusted Gross Income didn't match the IRS records. I called the IRS to verify my AGI and they had the same thing I had. I asked Turbotax what was happening and explained that my AGI was right and they eventually admitted on the phone that they had some kind of glitch on their system which was causing the problem on their end and that they had spent the last few days fielding AGI Problem calls. THe consequence of this glitch is that the IRS rejected my filing, it is not considered late, I will incur late filing fees (according to the IRS but Turbo Tax swore up and down that I won't incur late filing fees), possibly damaged my IRS Status/Reputation...and it is now 4/21 and I'm still having to now send a form to IRS to verify my signature. The most obvious consequence is that I will never use nor ever recommend using TurboTax when it comes to doing taxes.

Well we are from Canada and have moved to the US part way through the year of 07. We tried the basic Turbo Tax for the US and it does ask about being from and earning in another country. Then it gets to points that make us sound like we are US citizens working out of country and coming back. We couldn't find the right way around this. I have done online chat twice with the person having no knowledge on how to do this. Then 2 hours on hold and then the tech couldn't figure it out either and he just hung up. I did online again and they said I would have to go through the phone hold again. 2-3 hours. The disc is in the trash Had to file an extension until my accountant becomes available. The Canadian tax form takes all this into account and was easy to do on paper.
My husband and I bought the Delux Vesion of Turbo Tax becuase we have jobs, rentals and small business. We also did our grandsons taxes. Not one would go through on e-file and all the stated errors from Turbo Tax were, in fact, not errors yet our account was charged for our grandsons taxes. With the looks of the complaints I've seen, I don't hold much hope of collecting the funds charged for services not rendered. I did report it to my bank and filed a complaint about the charges. Results are pending. There is an old story about newspaper editors getting letters on any subject...for each letter it is thought there are a dozen who have the same complaint or opinion and don't write. I'd bet it's more with Turbo Tax.
Purchased Premium Business software to do both Federal & California returns and Turbo Tax failed to mention required California forms 568 or 3522 since 2005. Substantial consequences to hundreds of clients are not yet known.
For thetax year 2007 version of turbotax, Intuit is no longer properly updating the error messages and how to resolve them. The turbotax website only refers to similar issues with the 2006 version - not the 2007. And even that information doesn't allow for fixing the error. Because of the error, I cannot file electronically - the entire reason I use this program. I won't be using it again.
I bought Turbo Tax and it has state and federal income taxes combined into one software. However, Tennesse doesn't have a state income tax. I notice that the prices this year are higer than last. I don't like Intuit bundling everying like that. Last year state and federal taxes were seperate software. cost about 12 dollars more this year veruse last year.
I have used Turbo Tax for years. This time I used easy pay and that was a mistake. I had to fight to get my money from H&R Block Bank. I'm sure they collected a lot of interest on all of the money they held onto. On my forms they changed my bank info to theirs. I never gave permission for them to do this. I just found out since H & R Block CHANGED my bank info on my forms when I used Turbo Tax and easy pay, my rebate check will have to be mailed LATE. The IRS will try to deposit it into the bank on record and when it is refused/returned (I'm sure after they hold it for awhile) it will then be mailed much later. Could be after JULY. I should have gotten it the 2nd week of May. TURBO TAX..NEVER AGAIN!! Had to borrow money to pay bills. Now my rebate check will be held up due to Block Bank. I don't know if they will hold onto it or immediately return it to IRS.
Turbotax's design for its Basic version is so bad this year. As a consequence, you feel forced to upgrade ($49.) to maintain the level of assistance experienced in previous years. You can only get the sense that they do this to increase their profit, and end up feeling ripped off. You bet I will stop using it (after 5 yrs!)Oh, and don't try contacting them on the phone or by e-mail. There is no way. Time was the commodity I lost, and as a self employed consultant, this was the most frustrating part of my ordeal with their Basic version. Let's put it at a full ten hour workday.
I have used Turbo Tax since DOS computers. I begain E-Filing with Turbo Tax as soon as it was made available. There was a originaly a charge of $9 to do the E-Filing. This year it almost trippled to $17. I paid $35 dollars to E-File both my State and Federal Tax Return. Several years ago I received a post card from the IRS that I was a candidate for Direct IRS E-Filing because I had E-Filed my Taxes the previous year. Did not hear anything else from the IRS sinse than. Turbo Tax is ripping off thier users. One gets locked into using Turbo Tax because of the Year to Year cary overs and the ease of trasporting your tax history in to the current year. I believe that trippling the charges this year for E-Filing is not justified. The IRS should allow us to file directly bypassing these rip off companies.
Do not waste money on audit defense. I submitted federal and state taxes online. One of the states instituted an audit because TurboTax did not submit the exclusion documents on the sale of property in another state. After failing to reach anyone at Intuit concerning this audit, I responded to the state auditor myself. Persistence on my part finally resulted in a contact with Tax Resources of Citrus Heights, CA who contract with Intuit to provide the audit defence service. Tax Resources informed me that they send paperwork to Vancouver, WA and mail a certificate to me. This process takes 3-4 weeks. By the time I would have received any documents from Intuit/TurboTax/TaxResources the responsed time allowed by the auditor would have expired. Interjecting a third party at that point would have only inflamed the situation. Not responding to an auditor's demand is not a good thing. Fines and penalties can result. Cooperating with an auditor is always the best way of resolving disputes and misunderstandings. Intuit/TurboTax/TaxResources haven't a clue or concern about customer needs and customer service.
I cannot file my taxes without the updates. I have called the automated line twice and requested the disks to be mailed to me. As of April 1, 2008 I have not received them. I am unable to find a phone number for turbo tax. I am unable to reach live help via the web site. The program will not allow me to file without the updates. I am at a loss for what to do. I have used Turbo tax for the past few years. Today I made an appointment with my local IRS office to file my taxes and have contacted the store where I purchased Turbo tax for a refund. All I can say at this point is I will NEVER purchase Turbo Tax again
Turbo tax informs me (after I had done the bulk of the work on my return) that they do not have a schedule D available except by update, which is impossible to do over the net. In essence, I have to re-do my entire return, by hand, something I should have done in the first place, taking the seventeen or dollars or so and tossed it into the Potomac River.
I filed an efile tax return. The IRS rejected my tax return but Turbo Tax failed to notify me. After I corrected my tax return, Turbo Tax then sent me an email saying the IRS rejected my tax return. When I called to find out why, they said the IRS had not rejected my tax return--after waiting on the phone for one hour and thirty five minutes. I paid extra money to do my state taxes. I was told by Turbo Tax that I would received $2337 dollars but only recieved $417. When I called Turbo tax to find out what happened I waited on the phone for another 45 minutes. After talking with an agent who was clueless about what to do I asked to speak to a manager. I was told that all I needed to do was wait one minute. I waited another 15 minutes and a manager finally answered. After me explaining the situation, he hung up on me. I am past due on paying my bills. I was told I would receive my return within 9-14 days and it has been six weeks and the $10,000 plus I was told by Turbo Tax that I* would recieve has not shown up. I spent two hours on the phone using my cell phone not to mention my time which is worth $300 an hour.
I've used this product before but this year I can't submit my taxes without an update, when I call the company I can't get a real person and the voice mail says they will send me a CD update. I can't down load an update and haven't received the CD. I will never use this product again.
I fail to see why this company feels it appropriate to charge $17.95 more to federal efile using a purchased tax product/cd which already costs $45 when one could free file on TurboTax's own site. What a rip off! I won't buy that product again!
Turbo tax put my non-cash charitable contributions under non-reimbursed employee expenses. I have been audited now for 2 years. I did not file or have a w2 yet this is were turbo tax put it. The IRS agent told me too many people put their trust in the program. Of course turbo tax is not liable Now the IRS is saying I owe them $10,000.00. I have to re-file and hope for a good outcome.
Turbo Tax has COMPLETELY screwed up my taxes. I am now going to have to file three amended returns! Worst of all, you can't get them to help or even make an effort to figure out the problem!!!
I'm a small business owner and thought it would be safe to use Turbo Tax to file my taxes. I file my first one with them for my business in 2005. I used Turbo Tax because they claim to be 99 % error free. I had used them prior to this for my personal taxes and had never had a problem. Suddenly in 2007 I received a notice that I was being audited for 2005 and 2006. I went to the IRS for my audit and now I owe them aprroximately 20,000.00. For some reason all my Business Deductions also ended up being claimed as Unreimbursed Employee expenses. How this happened I have no idea. I am not an employee for anyone and have not had any W-2's to file. I don't recall imputting these figues when completing the forms on line. Even if I had of done this I can't understand why, TUrbo Tax did not catch the mistake. How could I claim this as an Unreimbursed Employee expense when I did not show any W-2's. I tried to call Turbo Tax and ask questions about what could have happened. But, I could not get anyone to really discuss this with me. They just kept saying they were not liable. There has to be some clitch in this program. It happened for both of the years that were in question. Now I'm having to try and make monthly payments to the IRS. As I stated I'm a small business and I can't pay back 20,000.000 at one time. In 2005 I thought I purchased the audit denfense from turbo tax. But, they have no record of it. I purchased it in 2004 and 2006 and they have that on record. When I asked about the audit defense for 2006 they directed me to another company. I called them but they said that would have had to contact them prior to calling the IRS about the audit. So, they could not help me. I am so frustrated. I have been told to get a lawyer and fight this. I know this will cost additional money for lawyer fees. So, I am at a loss of what to do. I am single Mom trying to ruin this small business. It is very hard to find information, especially when it comes to taxes and the IRS, al the legal information gets to be a little much if your not use to it. I still think Turbo Tax should be liable for their part in this error. This program will catch very simple errors and will not let you finish processing your taxes until the errors are fixed, so I can't understand how such a major error could go undetected? Especially two years in a row. I hurried up and contacted the IRS as soon as I received notification of the audit. It said I only had 10 days to do this, I didn't want to wait to do thisbecause it was right before the Holidays last year. Now I've been told that I can't really do anything becaue I've already siged the forms and agreed with the IRS finding and made arrangements to pay back what they say that I owe. How was I suppose to know all of this? Now I just feel stuck. This is causing me a great deal of financial hardship. Not to mention the phusical stress I have been through trying to understand everything with the IRS.
I've used and trusted Turbo Tax for many, many years. That is until last year (2007) when I filed my taxes. I purchased the current version of Turbo Tax and inputted all my info and e-filed. However, before I could print or backup my computer my computer crashed - permanently. I ended up buying a new laptop a few days later. Because I hadn't had a chance to print my tax return I purchased yet another copy of Turbo Tax (same version as the one I had purchased a couple of weeks earlier). I inputted the SAME info the EXACT SAME way and received a different refund amount! It was about $100.00 difference between what I had e-filed and what it was now telling me. Several weeks later I happened to mention this to my Mom's tax accountant and he told me that it didn't surprise him. I WILL NEVER, EVER USE TURBO TAX AGAIN! Its worth the extra money to go to a professional tax accountant.
I bought a copy of TurboTax, but was instructed to download a copy of the latest state forms. TurboTax would not allow me to connect. I kept telling me that I was not connected to the Internet. Next! I logged on to TurboTax's online tax service and filled the forms from questions put to me by TurboTax. All was good, according to TurboTax. All that was left to do was E-File the forms to Federal and State. I was asked to pay and was presented with a credit card form. I filled it out for an amount higher than I expected. Finally I clicked in the button to approve payment. The window window went away and left me without any message. Was I finishe? Were my returns sent? I checked the status of my retunrs and found that TurboTax had no record of me or my returns. On the other hand I could log on and go back to my return. To my embarassasment, I stepped through all the forms again and PAID a second time thinking I had done something wrong. This three days later, and I still don't know the status of my reurns. I hate TurboTax, I wish I had never heard of them.
I filed my federal and Illinois state taxes with turbo tax on line, february 07 2008. As of today, 3-15-08, I still have not received a DCN number. And do not know if my taxes have been filed by turbo tax. My refund was to be a direct deposit. I am due a refund from both federal and state, having been laid off from full time work, my immediate income is questionable and this return is most important to paying rent and bills.
I started my 2007 tax return with Turbo Tax online. What started out as $14.95, somehow ended up costing me $140 (including $30 for the Santa Barbara Bank & Trust direct deposit transfer). Of course, I am not told the fee until the very last second when I must choose between submitting my return OR starting from scratch manually. This was Feb 24. On Monday, Feb 25, I received an E-mail from Turbo Tax that said my Federal Return had been received by IRS. Also, on Feb 25, I received an e-mail stating Congratulations! [my] tax return had been accepted - that there was nothing else I needed to do. Also, on February 25, I received an E-mail from Santa Barbara Bank & Trust stating my return is expected to be deposited in my account March 7, 2007. However, when my return did not hit my bank account on Friday, March 7, I tried contacting Santa Barbara Bank and Trust. I received an auto reply that the IRS did not deposit the funds to Santa Barbara Bank & Trust. I then went to the IRS website and learned my tax return will not even be processed until at least March 18, which means I am not likely to get my money before April. I am a single parent living paycheck to paycheck. I needed to buy eyeglasses (out of pocket) for my daughter which are going to cost almost $300 - and that's mostly for the prescription lenses! I've had to put off buying home heating oil - so I've been without heat for a month. I had to get new tires on my car. (I had to charge the $400.) Not to mention I am feeling exploited and ripped off for $140 for a service that has not kept up it's part of the contract of an easier refund!
Software was advertised as easy for first time users and that I would be walked through sales of stocks. I was totally confused - made entry errors unable to go back to correct. The only help available without additional cost, was difficult and way beyond my comprehension. I looked for simple step by step instructions but they weren't available. The right questions were not asked concerning sales and roll overs of IRA and Roth IRA funds. After 2 days, I finally gave up and had to go to a regular Tax Consultant. It was very frustrating, costly and not as advertised. I did write them at their customer feedback address but have not received any reply. People should be warned this product is not as advertised. Had to pay Tax Prepare in addition to purchase of this product for $74.99 + 2 days of my time and frustration.
I filed in 2005 using the Turbo Tax from the IRS website. Having filed Separate and married, the Turbo Tax informed me at the end that I could not file electronically due to filing separately. I mailed my return in. So, why did Turbo Tax not catch that I was filing for a child tax credit and tell me that I couldn't take the credit because I was filing Separate and married? When I file my taxes online, I do not use a book, I rely on the Turbo tax that I pay for. So now, I owe the IRS money because Turbo Tax allowed me to take the child tax credit - and I had no clue that I wasn't supposed to - because a red flag wasn't thrown while I was filing. I fought the IRS with the issue, lost the fight, and had to pay full amount including 2 years of late fees. So, not knowing that I had filed wrong in 2005, I filed the exact same way in 2006. Guess who is knocking on my door again now for more money? I am a very honest person, and would not try and cheat the IRS. I relied on Turbo Tax to take me through, step by step, and finish my return legally. Had I known I had been claiming a tax not due to me, I wouldn't have done it. Is there anything I can do? I am going through a tough time, and it's not possible to dig into my pockets for $700.00 here and there. I just feel as though I was cheated by Turbo Tax - and if they had the program working correctly, I wouldn't be sitting here wondering how I'm going to pay the IRS again.
I used Turbo Tax and received the amount that was going to be deposited into my account, which when the money was deposited the state refund was on the money from turbo tax but was shorted on my federal by 700.00 dollars. After submitting it through, it was approved, but why did I receive a less amount?
I purchased TurboTax Duluxe to download online. This purchase included one state income tax. I completed my federal income tax and went to download Illinois and I could not get it to work. I tried to use Intuit's customer service links and those links would not work. Intuit promises satisfaction guaranteed but when I attempted to use their on-line link to request a refund, that link did not work. Nowhere on their web site could I locate a telephone number to call or find a functioning link to someone or to instructions which would enable me to complete my state income tax. Their satisfaction guarantee promise is a farce. I sent 3 emails to their feedback site requesting someone to call me and did not receive a response other than an automated response with more non-functional links. I spent a whole day on this and will now need to either pay someone to complete my taxes or purchase another product.
I completed my Federal and VA State Tax Returns and filed them both electronically, $17.95 each. I received an email notice that my State return was rejected by the State and that I needed to go back into Turbo Tax to see the reason. There were two error codes presented, 0005 and 0002 and I was instructed to mail my return to the State. I was given no instructions on how to correct either of these errors before mailing my return. I called their customer support, spoke with one international character that could not help and after a second 45 minute wait, a US customer support rep. that could not help me. My problem was to be escalated to the next level and I was to receive an email from that person. It is two days later and I have heard nothing back. The program will not let me get pass these errors and always brings me back to the page that says that I had an error submitting my State return and Lets find out Why. I don't want to file an incorrect tax return. I bought Turbo Tax because it performs a substantial error check before it allows you to file. By the way, the State return still passes this test with no errors. Why would I mail my return to the State if the State already rejected it? I wish to be reimbursed for my Turbo Tax Home and business Software and the two electronic filing fees paid, ($99.95 + 17.95 + 17.95. Total = $135.85). I also want an apology from Intuit for their terrible customer service and their ridiculously long waits on hold as well as for subjecting me to their completely untrained international tech support who only served as a buffer and not as a solution provider. By the way, I have used Turbo Tax every year since filing my 1994 taxes so I am very familiar with the program.
After using turbo tax for more than 10 years, our state return was held due to the fact that they said our school tax had not been filed in 2005 but our 2006 was. i was informed after a complete runaround that there are sometimes errors when using turbo tax and now I have to go through a huge process for them to pay me back for my penalty and refund from the state. Gotta love turbo tax. I sure will not use them anymore. A loss of my state refund this year $327.00 does not sound like a lot but in today's economy and being of medium income every penny counts when your counting them.
I have used Turbo Tax for the past several years without incident, until this year. I took an education credit last year, and while reporting this to Turbo Tax this year, I was told that I must recalculate the credit. I was told that I must either repurchase Turbo Tax 2006 to do it for me, or I can follow instructions to recalculate the credit manually. Due to lack of finances, I decided to do it manually. Or tried to, at least. The instructions are completely wrong. It says to look at section 4 of last year's education credit worksheet to use the proper values. It sounds easy enough, or it would be if there WAS a section 4. There are only 3 sections. To make matters worse, I have clicked on the contact us link what seems like a million times in the past few days. It brings me to a screen where there are contact options, but none of the links work! I cannot get a hold of them by phone, email, or chat. I am extremely disappointed and will never use their products again. Also, I just noticed that they added miscellaneous income, although I cannot figure out where they are getting this information, therefore I cannot delete it. I tried deleting the entire thing and re-doing my taxes. All of the numbers are the same, and now I'm getting a different refund! I absolutely do not recommend this product to anyone.
I have been a Turbo Tax user every year since I filed my 1996 Taxes, and up till now I have been satisfied with the software. However, this year I had completed my taxes on 25 January and checked the tax return before e-filing with no errors. I was getting a considerable refund and was expecting to get it direct deposited via Turbo Tax and the Santa Monica Bank I then went and paid with my bank card the $17.90 e-file fee and then was taken to a window where I selected e-file, and I was informed that the e-file did not take place because of missing information. I clicked the Show Me button and was then shown a blank W2 form with the first entry blocked and ready for entry. I then entered the information as I had already entered when I started working the software in the beginning. I was wondering why I was asked to fill out my W2 form again, but I reasoned that the e-file W2 format was somehow different, and so it required meeting the format of the e-file W2. After completing the information entry on the W2 form, I was returned to the e-file page; and I clicked on the E-File button and was informed that the information transfer was accomplished and would receive the IRS acceptance message sometime later. It was to my complete and utter surprise when I was allowed to print the File information, that I owed $7150 in taxes rather than getting a $5000 refund. I contacted Turbo Tax, and the Tech had me check and found I now had 2 W2s. He had me delete them and re-enter the original W2. I later found out that he should not have had me delete the W2s before doing some type of back-up. I called the IRS 800 number hot-line, and the Tax representative informed me that they had just finished talking with another individual who had the same problem with e-filing turbo Tax. Now here I am guessing at what was fully transmitted, needing my money and at the mercy of the IRS with my amended return. Not only that--I paid to e-file a bad return caused by Turbo Tax and a poorly designed user format. I think that will be the last time I ever trust that software, and I tell everyone I know who is using it to be extremely cautious! At work I have it arranged for single deductions for my taxes, and I am married and file jointly. I get a healthy return and was counting on it to pay bills for my pets' shots and checkups, a new television and needed automobile repairs. I also have an 86-year-old mother who I really need to visit and am unable to. I was informed by the IRS representative that my ammended return will not even be looked at until after April 15. This is too depressing.
TurboTax 2006 Program did not calculate capital gains interest the same way the IRS computers do - I.E. No schedule D automatically asked for, provided or printed out in tax return for some types of securities transactions. Therefore, I received an erroneous CP2000 notice for additional taxes owed. No Live Individual Available to speak with at TurboTax to provide help with erroneous tax notice. Went a head and over paid erroneous tax to IRS because of NO TurboTax Support. I DO NOT recommend using this software for filing 2007 returns in 2008.
I filed my federal and Georgia state income tax returns online using Intuit's TurboTax Freedom Edition. The program stated that my federal and state returns were accepted. As requested, my refund was deposited into my bank account, but it was more than $400 less than on my TurboTax return. The IRS website clearly reflects the lower amount I received, but the TurboTax site still says that my return was accepted. I am a homeowner and student who has been paying on student loans. What are my choices? This refund was going to pay one mortgage payment while I fulfilled a practicum requirement for my degree.
I was told that my refund would take up to 14 days to process. I paid an additional (non-disclosed fee) to Santa Barbara Bank, an affiliate of Turbo Tax, for the direct deposit into my account. The funds were suppose to be in today, 2/15/08. Santa Barbara Bank sent an e-mail advising that the refund was not sent in by the IRS, and that due to their processing procedures, I would not see it for at least ANOTHER WEEK. This is totally unacceptable. All the information I've gotten to date from Turbo Tax has been misleading and winding up costing me more money, and now a additional wait. I had purchased necessary items such as oil for my home, food, and a new wood stove to keep my home warm during this exceptionally cold winter. I planned on receiving my refund at the time stated by Turbo Tax so I could pay for this merchandise. Now I don't have the money to pay for these items.
This is the first year I have tried Turbo Tax and I am not very satisfied. The info was incorrect when transferred from the federal to the state. I have to file 2 separate state returns & both were incorrect but in different areas. I had to pay an extra $17.95 for the second state and will probably end up doing them manually.
I purchased TurboTax for my 2007 taxes after dealing with the fiasco that was HR Block last year. My taxes are simple; I have few deductions, but I do have several dependents. I completed my taxes in Turbo without incident; they checked out clean, and I e-filed, only to have my return rejected by the IRS (without notification) due (according to TurboTax) to an incorrect social security # for my son. I double-checked, and the number was correct, and all the other information as well. It is the same number I've been entering for the last 14 years. The only way I determined this was because I went back and checked through TurboTax because I never received confirmation of my initial E-filing. I refiled, was rejected again for the same reason, receiving the same error: 0504: Overflow statement-- Dependent social security # Seeing as the data is correct, it tells me their code is wrong. I called technical support, and they were nice enough, but gave me the BOGUS advice to e-file again with no entry for the SS # for my son, and when it comes back rejected, try and efile again. Well, the software prevents you from e-filing if you are missing a SS# for a dependent, so that whole method to solve the problem is garbage. So, like most of you, I'm out the $45 or so for Deluxe. SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE. THIS COMPANY IS RIPPING PEOPLE OFF. I am out $45 cost of TurboTax Deluxe and have delays on my Federal tax refund.
This year I used TurboTax online. Used the Basic version which is supposed to be $15 for federal filing. If you want to add state for $30, you can. (It says State is optional). So I got all the way to the end of federal. It asks you if you want to continue with State or skip State. I clicked "Skip State". In fact, I double-clicked to be sure. It then asks you to click continue (the only button you can click besides the back button). Beware! Once you hit this button the system automatically does State for you, and once it starts there is no going back. I didn't find out until the end that they did this. You find out by them telling you they charged you the whole amount. I called TurboTax. They said it was my fault and would not refund my money. I told them I would never use them again, call the BBB on them (which I did) and would warn everyone I met to never use them again (which I am doing now). BEWARE OF TURBOTAX. THEY ARE LIARS AND CON-ARTISTS.
Recived an email from Turbo Tax stating our Federal efile was rejected even though we had not even logged into Turbo Tax this year or started our return. The email came to the email address we have on file with Turbo Tax on the web. We have used the Turbo Tax website filing since 2002 and the same email address since 2005. The email was addressed to someone with a different name then us but the information connected to the email was disconcerning containing our SS#, and the same state my husband was born in.
I have a lot of proof that the problem with someone seeing your account is still not solved. My husband and I have not done our taxes for 2008 and someone, through this program, has filed a tax return in our name to the state of Mass and it was first rejected then whatever it was they did wrong was corrected and then accepted. It is really crazy, my husband and I have been dealing with this for a week now. I was actually able to do some things that proved my point after they supposedly shut down our records so no-one else can access them. I am having to cancel all credit cards and call everyone involved with our credit, etc.
I purchased the Deluxe Turbo tax last year and was told all my files would be kept so that this year the information would all be there. When trying to access my file, I discovered that I had none. After 2 hours of talking to technical support, they told me that the reason I had no file was because I purchased my cd from a vendor rather than from Turbo Tax, and I did not file on line. Of course this was never told to me when I purchased the cd last year. Turbotax promised that, because I saved my own file from last year, if I purchased the cd this year, I would be able to access my file. I followed up with an email to the company to confirm this and received no answer. I tried to phone the company and can no longer find any way to either email or phone them. I'm not sure if this company is likely to respond if I have troubles this year, and I don't want to waste my time and money. No real consequences exept that I have to start from scratch entering all my information again - a very tedious process - when I purchase another product to do my taxes.
I was auto-renewed for the product even though I specifically DECLINED auto-renewal when I did my taxes. I have contacted the company (which is a big pain to do--their website is a maze) repeatedly, been told I had successfully canceled, only to get contacted again days later to be informed about the status of my product. I never should have had to cancel since I opted out in the first place. I never should have had to call repeatedly, email, post on their forum (there are others on that forum like me, btw), call again, etc. Finally, I wanted to delete my account. I can't even get in to delete me credit card from their system without, get this, SIGNING UP FOR THE AUTO-RENEWAL again first! Forget about trying to get the account deleted.
I used TurboTax (by Intuit) last year to do my taxes. Several months ago I started receiving mail from Intuit stating that in order to avoid delay in shipment of next year's tax software I needed to update my credit card . These were legitimate mailings from Intuit (not phishing scams). I never returned the mailing and never updated my credit card info, but they still charged my card for the new software.
OFFICIAL REQUEST...FOR REVIEW AND CORRECTION OF FY2002, 2003 AND 2004.. AND MAYBE EARLIER. I NEED YOUR HELP ASAP...CALIFORNIA STATE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD OWES ME OVER $2500 BUT NEEDS CORRECTION DOCUMENTATION FROM YOUR OFFICE. I AM 72+, HANDICAPPED AND HAVEN'T BEEN EMPLOYED FOR 15+ YEARS. ALL MY INCOME IS FROM IRA AND SOCIAL SECURITY. SO THE REFUND OF MONEYS PAID FOR DEFECTIVE TAX SOFTWARE IS VERY IMPORTANT TO US. WE HAVE USED TURBOTAX FOR YEARS. I HAVE BEEN CHARGED PENALTIES, AND MONEYS, ETC. BY THE STATE AND PROBABLY BY IRS BECAUSE OF A GROSS TURBO TAX ERROR WHICH I TOTALLY MISSED UNTIL NOW..AND APPARENTLY THIS HAS BEEN A PROBLEM FOR OTHERS ACCORDING TO THE STATE TAX REVIEWER. TURBO TAX ENTERED MONEYS FROM SALE OF IRA FUNDS ON LINE 13 AS CAPITAL GAINS..WHEN THERE IS NOT CAPITAL GAINS APPLICABLE FOR IRAs. WE PROVIDED THE IRS AND THE STATE FRANCHISE BOARD THIS DOCUMENTATION SHOWING INCOME AND NOT AS CAPITAL GAINS. PROBLEMS OCCURRED IN MY STATE FILINGS AS A RESULT; I RECENTLY DISCOVERED TURBO TAX SW INPUTTED DATA INTO THE WRONG LINE...LINE 13... AGAIN....FOR AN IRA ACCOUNT..AND THIS IS ALL WE HAD....THERE IS NO CAPITAL GAINS. AS INDICATED ABOVE AND PER FILINGS...ALL INCOME MONEYS WERE DERIVED STRICTLY FROM IRA ACCOUNTS. TO DATE, I HAVE FOUND THIS ERROR IN OUR FILINGS FOR OUR IRS FILINGS FOR 2002, 2003, 2004...AND PROBABLY EARLIER. SOMEHOW TURBOTAX FIXED THE PROBLEM RECENTLY AS OUR IRS FILING FOR 2005 DID NOT HAVE THIS ERROR OF MIS-APPLYING THE AMOUNT INTO CAPITAL GAINS. I AM FARCICALLY ASKING FOR THESE TAX FILINGS TO BE CORRECTED ASAP AND ALSO ADVISE THE STATE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD ASAP SO THEY CAN PAY ME ALL THE MONEYS OBTAINED THROUGH TURBOTAX'S ERRORS. I SEARCHED THE INTERNET WEBPAGES TO TRY TO FIND AN OFFICIAL MEANS TO REQUEST THIS REVIEW AND CORRECTS. I COULD NOT FIND IT. BECAUSE OF THE FIRESTORMS HERE IN SAN DIEGO, THE LOCAL OFFICE IS CLOSED. I WILL MAIL THEM A COPY OF THIS OFFICIAL REQUEST. I WILL ALSO MAIL ALSO MAIL THIS TO THE STATE IRS OFFICE AND FAX THIS TO THE STATE REVIEWER. I EXPECT REIMBURSEMENT FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND ALSO WHATEVER IUS PROPER FROM THE IRS BECAUSE OF THIS TURBO TAX SW ERROR. I HAVE HAD TO PAY INTEREST AND PENALTIES TO IRS AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHICH I EXPECT TO BE REIMBURSED. I ESTIMATE FROM THESE LOST MONEYS TO INAPPROPRIATE TAX CHARGES, THAT TURBOTAX HAS ALSO DIRECTLY CAUSED ME TO LOSE ABOUT $200 JUST IN INTEREST OVER THIS TIME PERIOD BECAUSE OF THEIR GROSS ERROR. I AM CONTACTING THEM FOR REIMBURSEMENT ALSO AS ALL THIS WAS CAUSED BY DEFECTIVE SOFTWARE. I HAVE COMPLAINED TO THEM IN THE PAST ABOUT ANOTHER SW PROBLEM FOR WHICH THEY REIMBURSED ME. WE PLAN TO USE A DIFFERENT TAX SW PROGRAM FOR 2007 FILING.IT IS FRUSTRATING TO ME THAT I MISSED THIS AND EVERYONE ELSE IN THE IRS AND STATE TAX PROFESSIONALS MISSED THIS ERROR PREVIOUSLY. BUT IT IS NOW CLEARLY DETERMINED. I WAS CHEATED AND NEED CORRECTIONS OF ALL TAXES FILED. PLEASE TAKE ALL NECESSARY AND IMMEDIATE ACTIONS NECESSARY NOW. YOU HAVE RECEIVED ALL THE APPROPRIATE DOCUMENTATION... REGARDING INCOME, FIDELITY IRAs, ETC. $$$ ARE IMPORTANT TO US AS WE ARE NOW VERY LIMITED; REIMBURSEMENT OF MONEYS PAID BECAUSE OF TURBOTAX SW ERRORS IS A MAJOR CONCERN AND NEED FOR US. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIMELY ACTIONS, SUPPORT AND POSITIVE, SUPPORTIVE ACTIONS.
I never received an email to access the free experian credit monitoring they were offering for a year for using turbotax. It cost $85 to use turbotax and no I'm out the $40 value of Experian credit monitoring that was promised and not delivered. I wonder how many others got taken as well!
I used Turbo Tax to file my 2006 tax returns. I paid for both the state and federal taxes. Their system never filed my state taxes, and I had to file them myself. But Turbo Tax took out their filing fee. I have requested my money back on the state fee 4 times and as of the last email, was told I would get my money by check within 3-5 business days. I started this conversation with them January 30, 2007. It is now April 21, and still no money.
TurboTax Deluxe. If a change needs to be made to the state taxes once they are complete, the form has to be cleared and all the information re-entered from scratch. After trying to make a some changes without starting over, it took a few hours with customer support to figure out that it couldn't be done. It would have been quicker to do the taxes by had. Wasted money on the purchase of TurboTax Deluxe. Also wasted a lot of time because of the poor programing. Customer support said the state program was faulty and they would give a refund, if I still had a receipt which I didn't.
On 4/17 I was debating to use Intuit Tax Turbo to file my State only taxes since, I had been a regular user. I went in filled out the information and as I neared the purchase cost of $34.95 for the prep and 49.95 for the service would not be worth the cost especially since, I learned that I would be getting back $121. So, at that point, I decided to back up the page, and did not hit the CONTINUE button if, then I SIGNED OUT. Refusing the option. Money was taking out of my account. I decided do my taxes manually using the form from the .gov website that is provided on another website when I realized an e-mail poped on my computer stating confirmation of order. At that point, I realized, maybe they charged my account. I looked at it and sure enough it stated they charged me $39.95. When I called my back to see if transaction had taken place, my bank cust service said, they charged $35.45 which is a different amount! Called INTUIT, and they said, unfortunately, nothing can be done 95% of the time if you have a complaint you won't get your money back and rudely hung up on me.
Intuit is taking advantage of consumers. Unless you read every word of the disclaimers you will be hit with additional fees. At no time was there a warning that you are about to incur additional fees. Once the site has your money you are then unable to use certain tools without spending even more. I have hard copies of screen shots that show the hidden fees.
I was sent an email from turbo tax that it was free. I answered all questions then when I got to the end, I found out I had filled out preimum at a cost of 49.99 I have no deductions only own a car and draw SS and work part time. I feel I was duped. I am afraid to refile as they have my bank information and could charge me twice.
For three weeks I have been trying to complete my taxes with TurboTax and have been encountering one problem after another. The major problem, one that is undoubtedly related to the IRS and/or Congressional delays in issuing the latest changes in taxation law, is that TurboTax doesn't publish its updates until nearly the deadline for submitting taxes. Prior to filing, the instructions indicated that it was imperative to get the final updates. I called Intuit/Turbotax, and was told that a cd with the latest updates would be sent. Even after receiving it and installing the updates, I was thwarted from completing my taxes. In the process, I was informed that an error occured and I would have to use their SuperPatch. This connected me to the TurboTax Internet source which informed me that the download would take too long and I should get the cd update. My only recourse at this time seems to be filing for an extension.
Bought the premier version of Turbo Tax because I had income from a residential rental. the program asked for my 1099 info plus a few rental questions and then continued with other income sources. At no time did the program ask for my rental expenses even after the final review. I had to manually find the form and make the entries. I sent a complaint to Turbo Tax but they never replied. A few days later their customer service unit asked about their responce and I notified them I never received one. Since then I have not received a single reply. Luckily I've been reporting rental income over the years and knew where to look. If someone was not familiar with rentals this problem would cost them several thousand tax dollars.
Did online filing through turbotax. stated they charge $15. Charged me $40.96 and they never filed my taxes.
The 2006 TurboTax Deluxe failed to transfer federal tax-exempt income from boxes 8 and 9 of a 1099 form to the state program (Iowa). This state taxes most municipal dividends and interest from other states. A careful effort was made to make certain that the income was entered diring the federal interview. The problem was only detected during manual calculations on paper. Intuit failed to respond to e-mail and never made a scheduled telephone call. I had to do my state taxes manually. By the time that a software update was issued on 02/22, I had already submitted both my federal and state return. I believe that my return is accurate but it cost me about 6 hours of checking and testing the TurboTax software. Anyone in Iowa who owns partially tax-exempt investments and used TurboTax to submit a state return before 02/23/07 may be in for a real surprise at auditing time. If the bonds or mutual funds from other states were not claimed in Iowa, the penalties could be significant.
Software is error prone & tech support is in Pakistan. You will be disconnected and have a tough time conversing with these drones. They read out error responses from prompt screens and will constantly ask for your name number & zip etc then you will need to spell i out each time. One of the most frustrating experiences ever. Never again will i buy a product from Intuit.
Tried to install the Turbo Tax CD that I'm sent every year. Screens froze at payment screen. Tried several times, different times of day. No Luck. Called their support. They informed me that they were aware of bad cd's being sent. Advised me to buy and download online. Tried to do so. Same result. Went to store and bought cd. Installed. After initial installation it asks if you want to download latest updates. Clicked 'yes'. Told me I didn't have permissions. Made sure the firewall and virus software were disabled, checked permissions, tried again. No luck. Called their support. Their automated support line (can't get a person) said an update cd would be sent mid March - a month and a half AFTER I need it. No problem in other years, but now I'm headed to buy a different tax software. I'm out $50 and hours that I've been dealing with this.
On 01/23/2007 my husband and I decided to use turbotax online after seeing a discount for it on our banks website. We e filed state and federal taxes and paid the $45.90 for both. I even upgraded to TURBOTAX ONLINE DELUXE DEDUCTION MAXIMIZER; which is a money waisted when I found these myself anyway. I then think everything is ok until I get an email stating my state and fed e file was rejected. Federal said I did not have the correct AGI from last year and State said I changed my SSN! After comparing both State and Fed files from 2005 and 2006...I see that the SSN is correct on both tax returns and I made no errors on the AGI either. I then called intuit only to find out that their system was updating and messed up my efile. He even said my second efile will reject as well because their systems are still updating. This was AFTER they tried to blame it on me! It took an hour to be blamed on my end and 20 minutes on hold to find out their tech support told the guy it's their end! Oh, and no refund...I have to either print and mail my returns, keep efiling until their glitches get worked out (if that ever happens), or pay HR Block to do my taxes! I get no refund and am out $45.90. I now have to either wait until their glitches go away and just keep e filing, mail in my return, or pay HR Block to e file. I should have stuck with HR Block like last year. 
I recieved a letter in the mail stating the cost of online tax service as $9.99, including state and federal filings. Once I reached the billing section, the site stated the cost would be $49 dollars!!! This is the same site I have used in two previous years without complaint. Stating the cost at $9.99 is false advertising!!!!!
No problem preparing all forms, but program will not print for completion until program has been updated for omissions and/or additions to 2005 tax laws. It looks like I must now wait A MONTH before my data can be released to the IRS. I bought an outdated CD for $50 and Intuit is not prepared to immediately correct the situation. Looks to me like this is their year to really lose loyal customers and I am one of them.
My wife and I were preparing our 2005 taxes using Turbo Tax Online. When preparing the Federal taxes, there weren't any problems. However, when we got to doing the State taxes, the TT Program automatically transferred the information from Federal to State. However, it made a mistake in considering an "income" as a "deduction". This meant that instead of us having to PAY taxes on our income, we were getting an "easy" out from the Program (by not paying taxes to the state). Does Turbo Tax take the liability for that? Probably NOT! Everytime we changed the name of the employer on the Federal Income information, THAT changed our state refund! Isn't that great!! We spent $19.95 on the State Tax part of Turbo Tax. And now we have to redo our State manually.
I filled out my Federal & State tax forms - no problem. I had refunds for both - e-filed with a return confirmation. However, when my Federal refund was deposited into my account it was not the correct amount. In fact it was 87% less. I have sent emails to Turbo with no replies and do not know my recourse to have this corrected.
I have used Turbo Tax for a number of years and had no problem until this year 2004. On entering information for an investment property I was nver asked for the straight line depreciation that I had been taking for 30 years under the old rules. Also on entering IRA disributions from two sources, one went to the proper IRA line, the other to pensions. Both were placed in two different places by the same interview questions on Turbo Tax.
We have used Turbo Tax for at least five years, and never had any problems. This year, however, so many glitches have occured, we feel we have wasted our money and our time. Our first run through with the interview resulted in calculations by the program that multiplied numbers entered and called for a tax of nearly $100,000 owed the US government. After trying to trace where the final numbers came from and finding forms filled out that we never use, we gave up and started a whole new tax form. This time the end result was a tax refund of $600, and the discovery that a capital gains from the sale of business was entered on one form but not transferred to any other forms. After overriding and hand entering the correct information, we had a bottom line of $9000 in taxes owed. Even so, we started downloading publications and forms and tax tables and discovered, that if these current numbers are calculated correctly, the tax owed was not. And everytime we try to change a number- something we've done easily in the past years- Turbo Tax simply adds the new number to the old one and the tax is based on that, although the form seems to contain only the newer number.
I used Federal Turbo Tax and no problem...When I went to do my own Colorado State taxes, I ran into a question on Line 7. After some consideration, I decided to download State forms believing It would automatically fill in the State forms using my federal forms information (As promised by TurboTax). After all everything they need to know is in the Federal information... After downloading State, Line 7 was left blank and the program asked me the question I wanted answered. (Exclusions for Pensions and anuities). 1. The State Turbo Tax form is useless.... 2. I posted a question with Turbo Tax and they never responded to my email as they promised. 3. Since I downloaded from the internet, I could not fill out their forms requesting a refund (No account number??) 4. If indeed there is someone I could talk to I can't figure it out.
I used their Turbo Tax Deluxe to do my taxes and H & R Block found many inaccuracies which would have cost me $2,500 plus interest. It cost me $150 to pay H & R Block to correct the mistakes made by Turbo Tax Deluxe.
