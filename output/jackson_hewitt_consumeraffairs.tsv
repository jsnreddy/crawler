I wish I could give zero stars. DO NOT have your taxes done at Jackson Hewitt ("JH"), inside Walmart. They lure you in with a so-called "low" rate and by the time you leave, your taxes are filed and you owe them $606.00. If you can't pay on the spot, they charge you another $49.00 to have their fee deducted from your taxes. JH charges by the form, regardless of income, regardless of refund. My son and daughter-in-law went there thinking it would be an inexpensive place to get their taxes done. They are young and inexperienced and have a newborn. My son was in the Air Force, who previously did his taxes. He made just under $17,000.00 last year. That's more than $3,000.00 below poverty level. He has very little experience in these matters, and having come out of the military, he was polite and courteous and didn't know he could have gotten up, said no thank you, and walked out with his documents. When they first arrived he asked how much it cost. He had two Idaho W2s and one Illinois W2. His wife is a stay-at-home mom who babysits the landlord's son part time and gets their rent reduced by $300.00 per month. This for a total "income" of $900.00 for the year. The tax preparer, Trish, said it would be about two to three hundred dollars. My son thought that was high, but since he had just gotten married and had a baby in 2015, he thought perhaps it cost more if you file as a family. Again, he was inexperienced in these matters. Part way through the process, Trish told them it was "going to be a little more" because she had to file two state returns. Okay. Trish said that the trade of rent for babysitting was called a "bargaining agreement". Why she explained that, they don't know. By the time they finished, she had filed the return, and told them they owed $606.00. They didn't have $606.00. "Okay", says Trish, "then that will be another $49.00 for us to have it taken out of your return". Now they are up to $655.00. They told me about this over the weekend and I was furious. On Tuesday I called JH and spoke to Shawna who would not speak to me without my son's permission. Okay, I get it. I called my son to come to my office after work. He did and we called again and my son explained to Shawna what he was told by Trish and what he wasn't. Shawna explained that extra forms had to be filed because they were "self-employed". That so-called self-employment is because my daughter in law watches the landlord's son part time. Trish never mentioned the term "self-employment". She mentioned "bargaining agreement", but did not explain its importance. I argued with Shawna for the better part of a half an hour, explained the kids' position, and how I had found more than 900 complaints (on this site) against JH, more than 400 on another site, and that I was not going to go away. I wanted half of his fee refunded to him. $300 is more than enough to file his returns. He owns nothing. This outrageous billing has to stop. JH is taking advantage of low-income consumers first of all by disguising themselves as affordable by working within Walmart and second by gouging the customers with high fees and charging "by the form". I've had several phone conferences with JH (mostly me leaving messages) on the few occasions they returned my calls. I'm researching filing a class action lawsuit against them. If you are interested in being part of a class action lawsuit against Jackson Hewitt, please email me. Thank you for listening to my very angry rant! They will refund half his fee or wish they had!!!
I love Jackson Hewitt and they have gone above AND BEYOND resolving the matter.
My son went to file taxes and was charged $496.00 and he made less than 18,000.
I used Jackson Hewitt at their Walmart location last year and was satisfied with the service. I got my money and my Walmart gift card filed and got my money in a week. My only complaint then was the cost is expensive. However this year I filed on February 3. Here it is March 18 and NOTHING! I went back in on Feb 8 to inquire about my money and found out that the IRS rejected it because the tax prep didn't put my IP pin in right. I understand they are not the IRS and that this year the IRS is truly a nightmare but at least give me my gift card. They didn't even deliver on that. I won't go back next year. It's bad enough they charging me half my actual refund in prep fees. When I'll get my refund is anyone's guess.
After 9 years of attending Jackson Hewitt in Green Bay WI my husband and I had our taxes done wrong by them. They had to be amended and we were told they refused to fix their error unless we paid an additional $147 for the amending fee. This is on top of the $317 we paid to have taxes done. THEN we paid the $461 and they were done wrong a second time! I have contacted the corporate office repeatedly for over a month now and was just told after A MONTH, that this is franchise owned and I have to go through owner. Who will not call me back. Only the manager Donna ** will, who is completely unprofessional (making comments about how much money my husband and I cleared the year prior so that it shouldn't be an issue for us to pay this). I do not care if we are millionaires. I do not feel I should have to pay for your so called tax professional's mistake! Jackson Hewitt guarantees all taxes done correctly or money back. That is NOT happening. I was told they would not reimburse any money. I will never go back to Jackson Hewitt and will write a review where I can letting everyone know how horrible of service they provide for a lot of money. I have also reported them to the Better Business Bureau of Wisconsin.
I went to a local Jackson Hewitt location and spoke to an agent named Lisa ** who told me she was the district manager, she did my taxes and said the charge would be $300.00, I wasn't able to pay that at the time so she offered to file an extension so it would give me time to come back. I gave her all my original tax forms including my originals from my 401k & I also gave her my son's original tax document from his college because I wasn't sure if he needed to file, he was a full time student on a full athletic scholarship. I called after the extension was to expire and left her a voicemail requesting to just get our paperwork back, I was just going to try and do my taxes myself or find someone who could help me b/c $300.00 was too much for me to pay. I left her a voicemail. She called me back & left me a vm requesting my social security number and which office I filed in (feb 9th 2016). So I did as she asked. I waited for her to return my phone call and no call ever came. So I kept calling her and each time I documented what day I called and what time. Finally I left her a pretty urgent voicemail requesting that she call me back asap as she is keeping me from filing my taxes. She never called me back. So (feb 16) I called again she finally answered & said that she is waiting for the District Manager to find the paperwork at the corporate office and that she will call me back later that day to let me know the status. I NEVER GOT A RETURN CALL!!! Feb 22nd I called her again left a voicemail. March 2nd I left her another voicemail & then immediately after I called the generic 800# and filed a complaint with Diana, she advised me I should expect a call within 48 hours. NO PHONE CALL! March 8th I called back and a rep named Andi advised me that my case was CLOSED, she asked me if anyone called me and I said "NO that's why I am calling back now". So she reopens the case and says to give it 3 days till March 11 and if no one calls to call back. Today is March 12th, I just got off the phone with Jackson Hewitt and this time spoke to a rep named Pam, after placing me on a brief hold, told me that a manager "should" be calling me sometime today. Why can't they speak to me NOW!? I have called for over 2-3 months now, in the mean time I received a letter from IRS stating I haven't filed a return for 2014. YOU WOULD THINK Jackson Hewitt would have at least notified IRS to let them know they are the reason why a return hasn't been filed! I asked Pam for contact information for Jackson Hewitt Corporate office, an address where I can write a letter or a corporate number. She begins to give me the address of the location where I went to file which was in a WALMART store in Union City Ca, I told her that is NOT a corporate address! That address is to WALMART. She corrects herself and gives me address 100 Newpark Mall Newark CA 94560. SEARS store, again I do not believe that is a CORPORATE address as that is at our local mall inside Sears, she claims that is the "corporate office for that area". I then called the agent who originally took my paperwork from me, LISA @ ** and what a surprise that number just rings once and then a fast busy signal or call failed. At this point I am past IRATE AND FRUSTRATED! Not only would I like for Jackson Hewitt to file my taxes at NO CHARGE, I would like SOMEONE TO CALL ME BACK and I would like for someone at Jackson Hewitt to accept accountability and call the IRS on my behalf!!! I am willing to contact "7 On Your Side" which is a Local News Station that brings media attention to consumer's complaints. I won't stop until I get to the corporate office and they are made aware of how I am being treated, the negligence in keeping/storing my tax papers, and simply the bad business practice that this office has shown me. NO ONE IS CALLING ME BACK REGARDING MY ISSUE AND I NEED MY ORIGINAL FORMS BACK!!!
Went and had taxes done and to spell it out that could give a blank if it was resolved or not. Will never use this service nor would I recommend anyone to use their service.
My first problem was I called and set an appointment for 2 o'clock on a Monday and had to wait until 4 o'clock to actually get my taxes started. From then on it was even more downhill, all the questions I had the woman Desiree have no answers to. She then said I would qualify for the rapid refund and which I didn't, under these circumstances I would have never got my taxes prepared there. I could of did them myself as I have in the past. I was charged $450 then I have a problem viewing the status of my taxes in the first week on the "where's my refund" link and would call and ask them about it and they never had any answers. After the 21 days I didn't receive my taxes and they still had no answers. I had to call the IRS three times myself and the state about my state taxes, and didn't end up receiving those and due to them not putting in the proper information on my federal return I have to wait another 30 days for my federal taxes, a total of 51 days. I called and complained to customer service and they had the district manager of Colorado Springs call me, just to take the side of her employee! I had went down previously multiple times to get answers about my taxes and the office was 9/10 times closed. They opened whenever they would felt. The district manager decided she was done talking to me and didn't say one word and passed the phone to someone else and when I told the second lady that all I wanted was at least half of my $450 back since I did half of the work for them she laughed at me and said, "good luck with that." I have never been treated so poorly by any company that I've ever been to! I'd recommend learning to do your taxes yourself or finding QUALIFIED persons to do them!
We filed electronically at the JH Walmart in Indian Trail, SC on 2/5/16. We received our Federal refund but as of today 3/9/16 have not received our state refund. We called JH office and they have no idea where our money is...$667 MIA. We went on IRS.gov, JH site to track our refund, but something kicks us out saying we have incorrect info. Not so... Now what do we do? Agent told us they received acknowledgment that the return was filed but it should only take between 7-21 days to receive your refund. It's well over 30 days. We hope it comes sooner than later.
While at Walmart there are signs posted that if Jackson Hewitt does your return get a $50 dollar gift card. At the end of the appointment the guy charges me $149.83 and because it was less than $150 I don't get the $50 gift card. Can you say scam!!! Then he told me for every person that I can get to have their taxes done I get $15 dollars so I called to see where my gift cards are because I was told within two weeks I would have them. Well now they are saying I don't get them until summer.
My apologies for giving this company one star (it was required). Our experience deserves 1/2 a star or less! My daughter had (1) W2, (1) retirement savings contribution and (1) education tax credit. Jackson Hewitt wanted to charge her $250.00, the tax woman at Jackson Hewitt explained that they charge per form filed. When we questioned her about the high fee, she asked us how much we thought we needed to pay. We explained that the advertising said the returns would be less than $100.00. She got out her cell phone and "called her boss". From what we could hear on our end, it sounded like she was calling one of her children, not her boss. She hung up and quickly said, "I can reduce it to $150.00, but you don't get the gift card." Needless to say, we left and did TurboTax, for less than $100.00. I would steer clear of Jackson Hewitt, we had a very easy tax return, and did not have a good experience. Makes me wonder how much a more complicated return would cost if there was home loan interest, property taxes and, a few investments.
Filed taxes Feb 1st I still haven't go my money. I have been told two different dates I would get my return and still nothing. Dates have come and gone. I will never use them again. They are not trustworthy. I could do better if I done my own taxes.
Had our taxes done on Feb 5th 2016 - was the biggest mistake of our lives. The first thing the tax lady said was "Oh you have a 1095 A form. I've never had to do one of these." and I asked her what those numbers on the form meant she said "I have no idea" then I looked at my husband and said "I guess no one does." She then said "Well I do know but I would have to read it to explain it". So it cost us 164.00 and we left 19 business days of waiting on our check to be deposited. We got a letter from the IRS saying they needed more info and would need a 8962 form which is the form that went along with the 1095 A form so I had to go back into the office and another lady said "Yea all of us have been doing these wrong "and she started fixing it. I explained to her the steps the letter said to fix the problem. She said "Oh no we got an email today saying to fix the problem. We do it this way." It started our taxes all over again which the letter states not to do which is a 1040 x amendment form and I had already talked to HR Block and that lady told me to not let them do that cause it would hold up our taxes till Oct but I didn't realize that's the form she was doing till she done fixed it and sent it off. All we needed for them to do was go in and send a 8962 form along with our 1095A form but nope they have made it. Now instead of looking at 4 to 8 more weeks of waiting to get our refund we will be waiting about 16 weeks cause that's what the IRS told me when I explained what they did today in the phone. I called back to Jackson Hewitt to explain that they were doing this process wrong that the IRS said so and that they were screwing everyone and that they should be sued but the lady said "Well that's how we have to do it" and had no remorse for the huge mess up. It's not me they have screwed but thousands of others - my daughter is another one. Now she is going through the same mess cause of them and from what I heard from a lot of other people they have done this to them as well. If I knew a lawyer to contact about a lawsuit I would. No one should be treated the way they are treating people and screwing them over. Instead of an easy fix they made the problem worse - same thing the IRS lady said cause she also said they have a lot of people's taxes that Jackson Hewitt has messed up. I hope they get sued but people beware - this company is screwing over everyone.
Paying for a service is no problem, when the service is done as the agreement indicated. I've been a loyal J.H. customer for years. Even defending them to friends. Friends would ask why I didn't just file my taxes myself? I'd say, "I like the convenience and the security of going to Jackson Hewitt". I know I can do my taxes myself. I actually do all the math anyway and have filed them myself before. But the security of going somewhere that makes you feel like it's actually getting done maybe a little more efficiently than I can by myself. And then the fact that no mistakes should be made when you pay $511. But that wasn't the case this year. Jackson Hewitt basically broke the contract in the agreement that we had and they made up every excuse. I was calling and dealing with them for 2 weeks not getting anywhere or no proper explanation for what did happen other than they were blaming a service, American Express, for messing up. Somehow when I didn't go to American Express, I went to Jackson and Hewitt. They offered it. They said it be better to go that way. I personally didn't care which way it went. I just wanted to get my taxes done fast and efficient. That's what I pay for!!! And that's exactly what I didn't get. And not to mention they messed up on my taxes. My husband is disabled and he could have filed taxes as well this year but they said he couldn't. The lack of knowledge and information from them left me feeling like I definitely got robbed. This year was definitely an incompetent person. I could do my own taxes online. What did happen other than an employee that says he blames it on Jackson Hewitt. Even said he'd write a letter stating how he messed up and we "shouldn't have to pay $511 so we'd have problems". Taxes are free online. You can file yourself. (I KNOW) Basically did all the math. The only thing that guy did, took him less than an hour, because I like to make it easier, because if it's easier for them then hopefully it's easier for us to get everything in a timely matter. Just was very unprofessional and this will be the last year I go there. And last, Jackson Hewitt can at least take some responsibility for what they promise and what they actually sell!!! No thanks Jackson Hewitt.
The proprietary single employee at this location, the tax preparer and so called expert allowed me to pay 48 dollars to continue having Jackson Hewitt prepare my 2016 return giving me the impression that the $750 advertised instant refund would be approved for me. It was not only denied but it was never verbally disclosed to me that even if it is denied a significant portion of my refund will still initially go to the bank that denied the instant refund for holding for approximately seven to ten business days. This will hold up receiving my full refund for the same amount of time. So apparently this strange bank in another state refused my instant refund but because I gave them permission to SIMPLY OFFER ME ONE, they get to collect interest on a portion of my refund and hold that portion for seven to ten business days. WHAT A SCAM!!! When I called the tax preparer at the office, he referred to the "agreements" I signed. They were the agreements that he asked me to digitally sign with a computer monitor facing his direction that I had to twist my neck to attempt to read sitting on the other side of his desk. I signed in a hurry and a flurry at his request while other customers were waiting to be seen by him and him alone and he did not fully and completely explain what each page said before signing. You know, fine print and all of that. I think this loss leader instant refund scam and the so called tax expert's lack of disclosure about the details of mentioned refund scam are shameful. I will never visit this location, let alone have Jackson Hewitt prepare my taxes again.
I can't believe how all these reviews are exactly the same as what I'm about to say. I paid $550 to do my taxes and they messed them up. I haven't received them back and had to have them amended. Now I don't know when I will receive them. They blamed the IRS and Obama for it but they definitely didn't take credit and they tried to charge me to fix it. I will never use them again. I should've stuck to my original plan and done them myself. Oh and the loan thing I also only got $600 which I basically paid them the same amount. Such a ripoff!
I had my taxes done this one time at Jackson Hewitt and they messed up my federal check. They gave me a defaulty debit card at Walmart in Mountain Home. The bank couldn't load it to the card. So they printed me a check and never called me. 2 wks of it "being on my card" I called because I had no access to it. They said "Oh your check was printed on the 18th of Feb. We have it at the main office." The bank that I went to messed up calling it in and checking the receipt number. So had to reprint check. Still didn't work. Needless to say I just now got a check cashed and currently waiting for my state check to arrive at the correct mailing address. In 4-8 weeks from yesterday. Not happy. Not happy at all! Very, very bad experience! Will never go there again and won't recommend anyone to use them! If I could I'd give 0 stars! :(
In order to complete my taxes, a total of $270 was charged. I had a W-2 and IRA papers that needed to be filed. They'd informed me in the beginning it would be only $98, but the price quickly changed. Once I was baited in with this price, they'd made me sign a paper that had the clause "If I refuse to continue, a $25 fee would be charged". This clause was pointed out as soon as I'd informed them I wasn't going to be using their service. Reason for me not wanting to continue in the first place, was due to them not taking my time seriously. As she'd pointed this out, she'd informed me that it was only $220 and I might as well continue. Well it turns out that she was including the Walmart Gift Card in the calculation, which was $50; I didn't know about that. I'll never be using this service again. My last CPA was only $130, took me seriously, and respected my time. I'm seriously contemplating calling my cc company to report a "bait n' switch". This is MY hard earned money, not theirs.
We filed our taxes January 16, 2016. Still have not gotten taxes back. 4 different people gave me 4 different answers. They screwed up so bad. We still do not know anything and neither do they. All they keep telling us that is the same is "IRS screwed up your taxes." We told them to direct deposit money and then they still had a check sent for state taxes, which they took and we never knew it came in, still not getting info. on Federal taxes. 6 weeks and can't get and answer from Jackson Hewitt or IRS.
This is my first AND MY LAST time ever stepping foot in a Jackson Hewitt establishment! I had surgery and was out of work with no pay for several weeks, and I desperately needed to get my taxes done and receive the $750.00 advance. I got a $650 advance instead. I called the "so-called tax expert" and inquired why I only received $650 instead of $750. She said I did not qualify for the $750, even though she lied and told me the card had $750 on it. She charged me $412 to do the taxes and I asked her why was the fee so expensive. She said she did not set the fee, the computer set the fee. (Hilarious). I got a letter from the IRS stating that forms were omitted and it will be another 6 to 8 weeks before my taxes will even be processed. Went back to Jackson Hewitt so she could correct the mistake. She made the corrections but would not accept that it was her fault. She said it was President Obama's fault. UNBELIEVABLE!!! This is the WORSE tax experience that I have ever encountered in my entire life and I'm in my 60's. Do yourself a favor. If you ever see a Jackson Hewitt building... RUN RUN RUN in the opposite direction!
I went to a Jackson Hewitt drop off service where there was a sign directly above this stall that said taxes done for $150. So all the information was in and the preparer tried to upload an account to one of their serve cards and it didn't allow him. So the next day I took it upon myself to go to the main office from where the preparer worked from and had the main office try to open to new serve cards. Here's where it gets interesting. They couldn't do it either, so they said they have to cut me a check. I said "ok whatever to get my money, do what you have to do". SO IT GETS BETTER! After all said and done I seen how much it cost me to do my taxes, it said $368 plus fees, I asked "what happen to the $150". They said they couldn't do it that way because it wouldn't let them. SO THAT'S WHY I'M SAYING I GOT RIPPED OFF! OH YEAH THE $50 GIFT CARD WAS NOT USABLE. Please if there's anyone out there wanting to file a class action lawsuit against jackson hewitt, please look me up, I want in!
Due to their incompetence I had to have an amendment done to my taxes. They admitted it was their fault and they did not compensate me on any way for me to make the extra trip. And when I tried to file a complaint you cannot get a hold of corporate office to let them know I should have a right to express myself to them. Why do they not give you that option? I paid a lot money for a bad job.
People of America DO NOT USE Jackson Hewitt!! You will regret it!! I used them and they can't tell me where my state refund is!! Also I paid extra to get the direct to cash and it took 23 days to get it when the lady told me I would have it in no longer than 12 days! Also my wife got the serve card that was suppose to be for 750$ but all they approve you for is 600$ and it cost a ton of money!!! Jackson Hewitt is a total rip off. There is no way to talk to a head office!! Please read what I have written!! The BBB should investigate them. They are saying false advertisements to get people's money!! Oh and also my taxes cost me more than 150$ but I never received my 50$ Walmart gift card. I think it's in the pocket of the scam artist that did my taxes!!! I hope this stops people from making the mistake I did!
This location has the worst customer service ever. They have a bunch of tax preparers that must come from the housing projects with poor work ethic and mannerism. Will never do my taxes with this company again. Thanks Jennifer and Milagros for the worst tax experience ever.
Okay we went in to file the Wednesday the IRS closed. So we had to wait forever to get the advance or the loan and five nights later, when I finally got the Walmart gift card, the lady was sitting there straightening her hair with a hair straightener. Not the one that actually filed our taxes but the other one. Our federal check was supposed to be deposited into a card... Not!! Last night my husband, who keeps our whole tax return every goddamn year, went to Walmart to pick up our check... or I should say his check. He was allowed to sign ALL OF THE DOCUMENTS FORGING MY NAME. I never even showed my ID at any point that we filed. Not once... He was allowed to sign for a seven thousand dollar check without me as well... Thanks Jackson Hewitt for allowing this. I bet if I went in and a wanted to pick up the check, they wouldn't have allowed me to forge his name.
We had to pay 750.00 dollars to file our taxes then as we are waiting for our refund which it should have been deposited on 2/18/16 and they put the wrong account number, and now we will have to wait for two more weeks for it to be fixed! The Walmart in Cornelius Oregon is the worst I've ever had. Such bad service for such a high price
I went to file my taxes at Jackson Hewitt. At the time of preparation I was told I had to pay $300, but when it was done and already submitted, I was charge $594. Plus I paid $80 out of pocket to amend a separate tax return. So to file my 2 basic W-2 and an amendment, I was charged all together estimated $700 to file my taxes. Never was told it would be $474 for federal, $55 for state that take 7-21 days to get back, $20 for storage fee that they don't tell you about to hold your 1040 form that they don't give you, $46 for assistance fee. It's ridiculous and I'm having a meeting with them tomorrow to get a list of their prices and find out why I was charge so much. And I want to know did they have a cheaper offer because that what I was charge has to be the the highest they have. If I don't get answers I writing corporate, the news, BBB, and etc. to expose them.
False advertising - After calling Jackson Hewitt to see how much their EZ tax returns were, I was quoted a price of $48. I made an appointment to go in with my paperwork and was told it would be $120. After discussing it with my husband we decided to go back to get them done with the same paperwork I took the 1st time and was charged $194.
Had these people help me with my taxes on Feb 2nd 2016. Was charged almost 300 dollars. Way too expensive. Then I was told I would get a 50 dollar gift card via email. I received the email but there were no barcodes or numbers I could use at the Walmart register. I contacted JH and was instantly told it was not their problem. Sent emails to website and was told it was not their problem and to contact office manager. Office manager told me it was my fault for not checking my spam folder. Bottom line... nobody at JH is interested in solving my problem. I lose 50 dollars thanks to this idiotic tax service. They are lying about their 50 dollar gift card. Don't use JH, lousy employees and a true ripoff.
OMG. As a public service announcement I am asking you not to have your taxes done at Jackson Hewitt. I have been doing taxes since I was 18 and I usually do them myself, but a few times I have went to Jackson Hewitt. Of the three times I have had my taxes done with them, two I have had issues with getting my refund. So I call Jackson Hewitt to ask them how they may have messed up my tax return this time and the person LAUGHS IN MY FACE. I am upset because they have messed me up before and instead of an apology I get laughed at. Then I ask to speak with the person supervisors and he gets on the phone, doesn't ask my name or any information but says "well we couldn't possibly have messed you up." I thought having your taxes done at tax services where supposed to reduce the odds of something going wrong with your return. Not with Jackson Hewitt. Two out of three times! What are the odds? And their reaction? Is to laugh in your face!!!
On January 20, 2016 1st Time trying to have my tax done with Jackson Hewitt was a BIG mistake. I was not aware of the new laws about parents being not together. I understand many consumers are doing all to receive more. I was told I will get a 50$ gift certificate from wal-mart that did not happen. I mistaken given Muriel ** a wrong old email address. I called local office and mentioned I did not receive the wal-mart gift certificate. The lady on the phone took my new e-mail address and supposedly she will turn it in to her Manager. That was 4 days ago. Now that I know how Jackson Hewitt works I will never give any good or refer to any of my family and friends. Experience was bad, uncomfortable. No any given estimate on when do I expect my Federal Return. Most of all from the beginning the questions I was asked that I did not know about. Muriel ** looked at me as I was lying until I showed her my 20014 document from the other Tax Service. NO Stars even one.
Jackson Hewitt is a bad place to go to file taxes. They told me it would be 500.00$ to file my taxes. My jaw hit the floor. I asked why is was so high. It would cost 400.00 dollars to file. Then an extra 100$ dollars in other fees such as 20$ to store your file. 50-60$ dollars for the gold plan. Which if you don't pay it, they're not liable to pay the IRS if you were to get audited. Say the IRS says you owe us money. If you don't purchase the gold plan. Then you up the creek with no paddle. They taking people's money but not mine. I grabbed me and my wife's W2s and left. It should never cost that much to file taxes.
First off, I was told I qualified for the $750.00 advance. Which I had to apply for it myself online but Jackson Hewitt did my taxes and said I would be receiving the text. It took over 48 hours to get it. I was told I could take the whole thing out. The bank charged me a fee so I did not get a full $600 then my full state tax check was taken for fees instead of my federal's being used for the fees. I got way less than what I expected due to what I feel was some underhanded shenanigans. I have used Jackson Hewitt for years, but I promise this is the last year and I will let everyone I know that uses them that they are not about the right.
This was my second year going to Jackson Hewitt and will never go there again. First off had to wait over an hour only one employee working. Come on this is the busiest time of the year. Pretty sad they can't have a second employee there. Then another customer came in and was right at the desk I was doing my taxes at so that person could see all my information. I use to go to a private accountant but usually would have to wait a week to get my taxes done. It would cost me 167.00 for everything every year for the past ten years. So in 2014 I went to Jackson Hewitt it cost me 217.00 then this year it went up 95.00. Then when the manager called me she was rude. So enjoy your 95.00 cause I won't be back. And social media goes a long ways.
My experience with Jackson Hewitt thus far can be described as consistent. Every time I think we have turned the corner for home someone sticks their foot out and we are back to no answers or explanations. I understand that bothering the employees during work hours (especially when there's not a single customer in the location) was rather intrusive of me. However considering I was told after a series of errors, World series sounds more appropriate, that a regional manager would bring my check. After not showing up for three hours I felt compelled to ask if they would call her for me. But alas!!! She showed up paper in hand, bring your own stock if you are getting a check by the way, and promptly printed my check. Jackson Hewitt had redeemed itself. NOT. Walked the beaten path to the service desk and check was denied. I kept it as a memento to all the call center employees I had grown so fond of.
I feel so cheated. I was in need of the money now so I filed with Jackson Hewitt to get the 750 advance. I asked the man three times the requirements for qualifying. I was told that I had to get 1250 or more on my refund and the IRS had to receive and accept the refund filing. No credit checks, 0 % interest. Well I am getting over 5000 back. The IRS got the refund file, accepted it but me and several of my friend all were denied the advance. This company just lured me in and had no intention on giving any of us any advance in the first place. They charged the heck out of me to prep the taxes anyway. My friends agree we'll never do business with them again. I should have just used TurboTax like I had planned in the first place. I knew the offer was too good to be true. Jackson Hewitt is a con artist organization, that's all there is to it. You think they'd take care of you to ensure your continued business. I should have read the complaints online first. Looks like everybody's getting ripped. They probably only do the advance just enough to say they aren't lying. Never again. This place is so shady.
First off, the paperwork I got from them after I filed was NOT my completed tax paperwork. It was coupons for referring a friend and all the disclaimers about their services as well as the amount of my refund. WHY they feel compelled to think that crap was necessary to put in an envelope for safe keeping is beyond me. I could have used a copy of my completed taxes. Secondly, I have coworkers who efiled days after I did who are already receiving their refunds. Not sure why, but disappointment does not even begin to describe this experience. The girl preparing my taxes was eating and using her phone and rolling her eyes and being rude when someone called on the company phone. I will NOT be recommending this company to anyone and I will NEVER use them again. On a side note, I used them last year and gave them the benefit of the doubt but their fees are pretty ridiculous for the quality of work that they provide.
I have been calling Jackson Hewitt to fix my taxes. They told me to contact IRS myself however I have paid them $375 for them to do nothing. I have been dealing with the IRS and dealing with customer service tax managers and it still is not resolved. I keep getting the runaround for almost a month and I owe no back taxes just a refund. Should have done this myself and saved a big headache.
I went to the Jackson Hewitt in Walmart in Asheboro, NC and for one thing she was the only person there and my husband is a truck driver so he is pressed for time. She told me to dropped it off now. This was 10 in the morning. She said it will take her about an hour. Well I called back about 5 in the afternoon. She have not even started on it yet and she was so rude. She said she will have it done in the morning if she don't I will take my business elsewhere and I will keep you updated. This is the first time we ever used them.
I apologize in advance for the lengthy read. I have an account here of my dealings with them over the past couple years, that perhaps some may find useful, or perhaps can empathize with, and I'm curious as to how many others have had the same problems. It seems that customer service and receiving the advertised promotional credits have been a big issue among many. To me, this smacks of classic bait-and-switch tactics. I've been using Jackson Hewitt for several years now, and expect that I'll pay a little more for the sake of conveniences, but things have been far from that these past two years. Before when I was getting a considerable amount back for EIC before one of kids was grown, I didn't mind spending the extra for peace-of-mind filing. Now that I'm getting less back, and their fees just seem to keep rising each year, I'm far more scrutinizing of what I am paying for. My tax preparer this year was great. Jim at the Fairview Ave. location in Boise, ID (office 13114) was kind and understanding, and filed my taxes for me on Tuesday, Friday, January 15th. It looks like this year's returns went through just fine and I am good to go. Keep in mind that I was charged a total of $383.95 (and that's after a $90 partial credit) just to file just my 1040, Child Tax Credit, EIC for just one qualifying child, and my State taxes. Jim, as well as everyone I've worked with IN PERSON when filing my taxes with Jackson Hewitt over the years has been fantastic. Again, the problem I've had with Jackson Hewitt in general, has only been within the past two years, and I feel the cost of doing business is no longer worth the hassle and headache in dealing with them. Last year, I was way mistakenly overcharged, and charged at the Oregon rate for my tax filing fees. This took a pretty good-sized chunk out of our return. Once the problem was corrected internally and the correct rate was set, nobody from Jackson Hewitt offered to rectify the problem or reimburse me. I had brought it up this year, and mentioned that I almost wasn't going to come in because of the abnormally high fees (and other reasons that frustrated me with my refund last year and needing assistance in dealing with the IRS - See below). After filing my 2014 taxes last February, I received a gruff voicemail (as if though I were trying to pull something?) from a man at Jackson Hewitt that I hadn't dealt with before, call to tell that my Federal Tax Returns were rejected, and had already been filed under my name for that year. I met with my preparer the next day, and he helped me file a paper return and submit an affidavit for fraud. It was quite the mess with all the hoops I had to jump through with the IRS, State Tax Commission, FTC, and the three credit bureaus. This has been a common problem with many, in regard to folks being victims of tax fraud, and this wasn't Jackson Hewitt's fault. My issue LAST YEAR was with three things, during an already difficult time: 1) being overcharged and not being notified of the rate discrepancy (Jackson Hewitt refused to publish their various local rates and national averages)!; 2) being given wrong information about my refund method/not receiving my $50 Walmart credit; and 3) lack of support/advocacy with the IRS from Jackson Hewitt. After months of getting the runaround and no word back from the IRS, I had been asking for help from Jackson Hewitt for a bit of advocacy. I was told by customer service that the area manager, Kathy **, would contact the IRS for me. Apparently, according to customer service, all she did was tried to call the same number I did, and I suppose she got frustrated with being on hold for so long, the way that I had when dealing with this alone, and I never received any follow-up on it. I didn't realize I could do this until I researched it on my own, but I ended up seeking out at and obtaining my own Federal Tax Advocate in August, and finally received my refund a week later. This would have been nice of Jackson Hewitt to let me know this. This year, when filing my 2015 taxes, I inquired to my preparer about my being overcharged last year. Upon doing some research, he informed me that I was mistakenly charged at the Oregon rate last year. Jim was able to give me a discount off of my filings this year to help offset the overcharge from last year, which I greatly appreciated. I'm curious as to how many other Idaho Jackson Hewitt customers, if any, were charged this rate by mistake and were never notified or had their difference refunded? Still... Even $383 is a bit nuts to be paying to file a regular 1040, with only the EIC and CTC for one child. No student loans, to other special deductions or earnings to report. Paying for convenience and "peace-of-mind" is not always what it's cracked up to be, it seems. Perhaps having the two years' worth of promotional credits honored would have softened the blow. Also, for this year's filings, I never received any sort of email, for the advertised $50 Walmart credit. The is the SECOND year in a row that I have not received the $50 Walmart credit as advertised. Last year, I was told I would not receive it because I would be receiving a paper check, due to my taxes having to resubmitted manually with an affidavit of fraud. This was incorrect in regard to my refund method, as I found out. When my refund did eventually come almost seven months later in August, it was deposited directly onto the Jackson Hewitt card that I received the previous year. Not a paper check! Given that, I should have still been granted that advertised $50 Walmart credit. I feel like this may be viewed as some as a case of bait-and-switch, or poor internal organization. Not with any tax-preparer in particular, as again, everyone that I've worked with IN PERSON have all been great! Rather, I feel the problem is the Jackson Hewitt advertising policies in general, technical issues, and the lack of support and follow-up regarding these things. Perhaps there is intentional deceit here on the corporate level. I'm not sure. I was hoping that there would be some sort of resolution to compensate for the overcharge from last year (of which I was partially credited for on my recent 2015 preparations earlier this month), but for the two missing Walmart credits as advertised two years in a row, as well. I contacted the area manager via email, Kathy ** informing her of my above complaints and concerns. I was basically told in her reply that I was going to be put on the back burner. Her email included "The $50 Gift is as not valid with any other promotion or discounts." as if though I were trying to double-dip or something (she clearly did not read my email thoroughly) as well as "I will however look into your situation at my earliest convenience." I get that this is a busy time for them, and as Kathy ** put it the same email, they're "'Super Bowl' of sorts". I politely responded to Ms. **'s emailed reply, acknowledging their busy time, but also clarified my point with the following example: "I received no other promotions or undue discounts. If one goes to a grocery store with a BOGO coupon on a particular product, is accidentally overcharged on the first item, then not given the BOGO deal, once noticed, it would be a common policy to refund the customer the overcharged amount, and still honor the coupon. Not give the customer a refund for the overcharged amount, treat it as if though they received some sort of "deal" or "favor", and not honor the initial promotion. That's what I feel has happened here with being overcharged last year, and not being given the advertised promotion either year. Also being given the wrong information as the method of my refund last year, and having that be the reason for not receiving the promotion is quite frustrating." This was last Thursday morning. I've not received any follow-up or further acknowledgment, thus far. As per the signed contract, it looks like I may be limited with what I can do legally, including participating in class action suits. However it does look like I have the right to pursue arbitration locally via the American Arbitration Association, as well as a Small Claims Tribunal. Has anyone else considering perusing Jackson Hewitt and holding them accountable for the company's deceitful practices and poor customer service as a whole?
We had our taxes done. Told we should qualify for 600$ advance. We did not so we received our taxes direct deposit and it's minus the 600$. Jackson Hewitt said it's an oversight and they're trying to correct it! Where's my money? What a ripoff!
I went to have my taxes done. First off, it's not a $750 dollar advance. In most cases it's $600. Also I brought up that I qualified to claim a $500 credit on my state taxes because my son has autism (developmentally disabled individuals) and yes, that would have resulted in a $694 state refund as opposed to the whopping $194 they got me because they said my son had to be 18. NOT TRUE. Now I will be spending time and money to file an amendment and when I called about the "maximum refund guarantee or your preparation fees will be refunded" policy, the person I spoke with informed me that they will file the amendment for free but she doesn't believe that policy applies. She will have to clarify. The policy leaves little room for misinterpretation and I will pursue the full refund amount of nearly $500 damn dollars. Should have filed myself. This was in Bentonville, AR. The office I called to report the error and start the refund process whom promptly denied knowledge of the guarantee (although it's plastered on the website and on posters on their walls and windows) was in Rogers, AR...due to Bentonville.
BEWARE. BEWARE. Had my taxes done on the 31st of January. Had to help the tax "expert" how to fill out my own taxes. Was told I would get my return within 48 hours, no extra charge. 48 hours pass, and nothing! Turns out they didn't file something and now that the 48 hours have passed nothing can be done about it. Now I have to wait up to 21 days for my taxes to clear the IRS. Called their main number to file a complaint and someone thinking it was funny gave a number mental health. Called back was told they have no complaint number.
Filed my return on 1-16. I was told it would be the 17 when IRS started accepting returns. Ok. We were told it would be 8 to 10 days to get our money in. Well due to a mistake on their part they have Lost our money. Now all they tell us we have 21 days. I could of done them online for 0$ and had the same delay. Now they charged $300+.
I filed my taxes on the 25th of January. The lady gave me a American Express card for my funds to be received on. She also told me that I would qualify for the $750 and I did. She said that "it will take 7 to 10 business days for your refund to show up on the card." It's now the 8th and I still have not received anything. The status says Acknowledged Pending. What does that mean. Can someone answer this??? I filed last year with Jackson Hewitt and I had no problems.
So like everyone else agrees, Jackson Hewitt is a rip off company! They give false information to get customers and when called out on it, they are rude or don't want to deal with it so they hang up on you. You can't even contact a corporate office! I was told 2 times that the DM will call me back within 4 days because she had surgery, but no surprise she never called me! I was given false information on the amount of taxes I'm getting back and IRS said my taxes will be in my account by Feb 10th, that's what it says "IN MY BANK ACCOUNT" so with the serve card it should of been in my account today Feb. 8th. Nothing?! Then I called and they say it's a process and it won't be in there till Fri. BS. NEVER AGAIN WILL I GO THROUGH JACKSON HEWITT NOR WILL I REFER ANYONE! I filed mine at the Scottsbluff, NE location on Jan. 25th. I'm so irritated by this phony company!!
I will NEVER use this company again!!! I arrived at the office around 1:30 pm and I did not leave until 7 pm. I wasn't informed of how much the fees would be until after going thru the tax filing process which I paid over $400. I felt very uncomfortable with some of the questions I was asked that did not have anything to do with MY tax return. I was told that my refund should be deposited in 10 days. When checking the IRS website my information isn't even found but when I go to the Jackson Hewitt app the status of my return is "Acknowledged" whatever that mean. All I want is a day of when my deposit will post but no one can seem to tell me anything.
I was charged $599 to get my taxes done. For one hour of work? I have used Jackson Hewitt for at least 8 years. No more!
Jackson Hewitt said $750 only got $600. Been going there 4 yrs. Quoted me $400 to get filled out and still takes 21 days. They will tell you anything to get your money.
My son and I filed at Jackson Hewitt and they gave us a debit card. This was Jan 19 and haven't received anything. Should I be worried? What can I do? Please help.
Very disappointed, rip off, could have gotten more of a refund elsewhere and not been charged $400!! Will Never return to Jackson Hewitt. Hopefully they will stand up to their money back guaranteed.
On January 15th, I went to the Jackson Hewitt office here in Las Vegas 5130 S. Fort Apache Rd and filed my taxes. I was kind of hesitate on filing so soon because normally I file in late March early April, however I was told by the tax preparer that it was not too soon. People had already started receiving their returns. So I explained to him that I needed it sooner this year than later, and that I was going through a hardship being a single mother with a child with a disability. He convinced me to file and told me that I would have my return in 7-10 business days. After waiting 7 days I checked the website "Where's My Refund" and it was still in the processing status. Today is February 5th and I'm still in the processing status! I have paid $389.00. The highest I've ever paid to file expecting to get my refund within 10 business days. After calling Jackson Hewitt more than 10 times asking for a superior or a corporate office number to tell of the BOLD FACE LIE I was told no one has yet to contact me after being told 3 times to expect a call from management within 24hrs. I'm disputing the tax preparer’s fees and BAD business practices. Right now I'm threatened with an eviction notice! Because I depended on Jackson Hewitt words. I WILL NEVER EVER USE THEIR SERVICES AGAIN. Jackson Hewitt is RIPPING people off left and right! My advice to people doing business with them DON'T!!! YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED and they don't have a care in the world for you once they got your money so Think twice.
We chose to go to Jackson Hewitt to have our taxes filed only because of the offered tax advance refund. We paid over $560.00 to Jackson Hewitt. We were told that we would be approved as long as our refund was over $750.00, which it was. However, when you go to apply for the advance online, it tells you that you do not qualify. I feel like this is false advertisement, and when we requested our money back, we were told we could not get it back. This was my first AND last experience with any of these "get your money fast" businesses. We were LIED TO.
I am so so upset. I filed on the 19th of January and I have not received my refund. They charge me $400 overpriced. I have family members and co-workers who have filed through Turbotax and went to H&R Block and filed after me and they have already receive their refund and they filed for free and no more than $150. I am beyond pissed. I keep getting the run around and different people telling me things. Jackson Hewitt is obviously lying and covering up something. I will never ever go there again and I will make sure everyone knows this company steals from their customers and not produce anything but **, I want my fees back!
The IRS website says received processing... The state website don't have me in the system. After reading so many horrible reviews I get in contact with the 877 #. The tel says "You're on yellow. Just waiting for the IRS to release your funds." I get the number to the office where I filed. She say "Hold on. Let me look it up" but she did not and my name or ss # so I'm try and figure out how she certain everything is ok. 16 days later with no expected date of refund. They can't give any information that is accurate. I had four people all tell me different stories. One of them didn't look me up but passides me I'm waiting for the funds to be released. The fifth today said the IRS system is down. No one got a check today when my question was what's the status of my state cause the website say there is no records of me. First and last year.
I've used the same Jackson Hewitt for several years. No changes from last year in how I filed. The cost was $83.00 last year. This year the cost was $266. They will not get a chance to overcharge me next year. RIDICULOUS!
I went to Jackson Hewitt and got my tax done and got charge over $400. And I have use them before but had good experience but this year I'm very disappointed in them. Not very helpful and I still have not got my refund going 14 days. I paid a lot and I'm very upset with them.
Well wish my husband and I had seen this site before we ever decided on Jackson. Normally I do the taxes but this year had some changes, wanted to go to a professional... (rolling eyes). So I called Jackson, asked if they could easily us in, the guy said "Yes come on down." I ask if he had any idea how much it would run me cost wise, explaining tax situation - he responded with around $160 to $180.00. OK now, that should have been a simple return, (and could have been done in 30-45 minutes). We walked in at 2 pm on Friday, and out at 5:56 pm with printed papers (but not a tax return) and the woman left out a form, which if she had entered would have made a slight but 61 dollar difference on my return, but she phoned some idiot who told her didn't need to be entered, went with RA. So total cost came to $326.95, yes got ripped off another 49.99 by the thieves which they never said you have to pass a loan process when they are getting guaranteed money from the Federal government which I do not understand!!! Anyways, still no money, can't get a hold of anyone! NEVER AGAIN JACKSON HEWITT!!!
Jackson Hewitt did give 600 dollars advance but lie about everything else. They was say "am going to call back." I have to keep calling them.
After reading all the negative responses I am pissed! I filed Jan 15th and still have not received my own money when I received an email that it was deposited into my account 7 days ago! I usually do my own taxes but needed money now. Will never use again!
I filed because there was a BIG sign that said if I used their service to file my taxes I would be able to get the $750 RA Loan... Welp, lie! I tried to apply for it online and it kept saying "Your information could not be found." So I called Jackson Hewitt to see and was told that I didn't qualify because I didn't pay $150 or more in tax preparation fees!! Wth?? Nowhere, anywhere I've researched said anything about that so I'm confused... Apparently it's just a marketing thing to get people to come use their service although it is false advertising. I don't know of anyone who has gotten that loan yet but whatever I've learned my lesson and will not be working with them again in future years. Also, I filed January 18, 2016 myself with their online service, was accepted January 19, 2016 @ 3:30 a.m. Then where's my refund? Has been stuck on still processing ever since! Was told three different ddd Jan 29th, Feb 3rd, Feb 5th. Well it is Feb 3rd, still nothing in my bank account nor have anything pending so I have no idea when I'll receive anything. I just have the option to check every single day because nothing is updating. I paid $64 for preparation fees which isn't too bad but was told I'd have it within 8-14 days. Lies upon lies upon lies. I mean who owns this company and is allowing this ridiculousness? Do you realize how many consumers you lost just behind false advertising!? Wtf is really going on??!!
They offer a 750.00 American express serve card...but fail to tell you to respond to a text from someone else so they can hold your money longer. We were told that our refund would be quicker with a cashier's check. Well three days later the card is rejected because we were not told about a text and we were told the quickest way to get our refund was with the cashier's check. Yeah right. Twenty-one days from now they will receive our check and we will never receive the 750. Advance from the card that has hidden ** to it. The instructions that came with the card doesn't mention it either. It talks about activate your card this way and you will receive... It's a total ripoff, don't do it. The call center tells us that we are not the only ones, there's a lot of other people getting ripped off. This real nice people, real nice. Correct this, activate everyone's cards or issue New. Where is our guarantee??? This is ** up ripping people off. You will lose a lot of customers for this one. Watch and see. I'm not done with this. The state and all is going to hear about these people... Uuuhhhgg.
I went to JH last year and had no problems whatsoever, which why I came back this year. But this year so far has not been good at all. When we went to get our taxes done it was fairly easy, little too easy and we wanted to do the AR loan. So I figured since she asked me if that's what I wanted to do then that was why she took my direct deposit stuff down, had me sign a bunch of times electronically, and said it would probably take a few days because of the weekend to get the advance, then we all set. Well Monday we called and they said, "did you do the application online"? And we were like "no", nobody told us to do that! Now I'm looking through my paperwork and seeing they charged me for this too. I'm pissed! Wth she never said go online and fill out anything AND she didn't explain anything I was signing. She told me to sign like 10 times but NEVER explained anything at all. This is bs and I'm not finished with these people yet. They have met the right one this time.
Wish I had read all of the negative reviews before I went here. I was desperate, needing to have them done on Sunday in order to download the documents to a financial aid website with a hard deadline. Paid $75.00 last year for a computer program that did exactly what JH did at Walmart, but figured it was worth the extra cost in order to be able to submit the required documents. Well, I have tried for two days to get on to access eDocuments. There is some sort of glitch in their system, or maybe they just never bothered to download by taxes. Anyways, the customer service number on the letter that says, "If you need any assistance with accessing your documents, please call us at 1-877-476-3353" is useless. Last night they said the problem would be fixed in two hours. Today the guy said I would have to go back to the "office" behind the curtain at Wal-Mart. Really? What is most irritating is that the sign on the desk when you go in says taxes are $210 for the basic package and an extra $100 for any schedules, etc, including the child tax credit which most places include in the primary fee. Okay, $310. Well my bill was $383. What they don't put on that sign is that you HAVE to pay extra for their gold guarantee and their online access. I was told this was not a choice. How ironic. I paid extra for something I can't even use. And now I can't download my taxes to this financial aid site. Jackson Hewitt royally screwed me. Don't let them do the same to you.
My advice to everyone is contact your state's attorney general office to complain. I personally I have had numerous conversations with my local office (pine street in Williamsport pa) and the corporate office as well. My particular store made fraudulent claims that I would Have my return within 21 days as I was informed the day that my taxes were prepared. In fact last week I walked several miles to go talk to someone there to find out what was going on with the American express card that I was talked into getting (and paying $49.99 extra for because it would allow me to get my return faster). Well that day I spoke with the owner Tom **. He told me that I should have my return by this past Friday. It is currently 6:54 pm Monday February 1, 2016 have not received my tax return. That day I informed Tom and in previous phone calls to the district rep Ellen that I need my return to purchase life sustaining food because I am that low on money which from that corporate office phone call I was informed by that rep that she was in a very similar predicament about to lose her car because she can't afford it. Well hello Jackson Hewitt Rep. That is not the same thing as I am going through. Today I spoke with my local state representatives office and was told that I really needed to contact the Attorney General's office and that he was able to send the paperwork for me to get the ball rolling and file my complaint. So I would encourage everyone else out there to do the same.
I will not bore you with my story as it is the same as everyone else. But, I want you to know that there is something that can be done. If you read your contract, then you know your hands are tied with filing a class action lawsuit, but you can take them to small claims court. You can also peacefully protest outside their offices. Let the people going in at least know about these reviews so they can at the least make an informed decision whether to proceed. We can make a difference if we take the time to care and inform. Also, do not hesitate to call corporate and inform them what is being said and done on a local level. Sometimes the squeaky wheel does get greased.
I will never use Jackson Hewitt again. They lied about the card. I always said H&R was the worst. Boy you all proved me wrong. I filed weeks before other people I know they received theirs, and I'm still dealing with this freaking card when I ask for direct deposit. "Oh the card will be so much better." Stop the lying to customers.
I don't think it's fair for a Jackson Hewitt employee to give me a finishing time on a client. Then HAVE me stand there without letting me know it's gonna take longer. I think it's bad for business to assume. Just be accurate and say to the customer you don't know what time you're gonna finish.
I went in to file my taxes like I have every year since 08. This year I went in at 4 and didn't get to leave until 9! The guy who did it didn't act like he knew what he was doing. I made more than I did last year and somehow I'm getting back less!?! I just don't get that. Also I was told I would get a gift card. Didn't get that email to me either. Didn't get approved for the advanced money loan that I was told was free. I feel like he messed up my taxes so I bought the gold guarantee in case. So over 400 dollars in fees later I'm upset and not a happy person at all. I always loved them but this year I'm scared of ever going back to them unless they fix this problem.
We use Jackson Hewitt because of the quick refund they promise, they told us that Jackson Hewitt customers get their taxes back in 10 days or less, but are now being told, that the IRS isn't releasing funds until Feb. 6th. They knew this and yet still push the 10 days or less to their customers...
I truly used to believe in second chances. I was accosted by name by the manager before even given service about a complaint I made to their customer service line. In her words, "I remember you. I was told you complained about me and I know why because you didn't get what you wanted." At that point I felt threatened so I said, "Yeah you made rude comments about Blacks and Mexicans and healthcare workers. You need to use discretion when you work with the public." We are not co workers. I am a CUSTOMER!!! The nerve of this woman instead of doing her job and possible winning my business she provoked a fight!!! I'm very disgusted for even given this place a second chance.
I went to Jackson Hewitt this year ONLY because they guaranteed a tax advance up to $750 with no credit check. The first day I went, I spent over four hours there because the system crashed literally every 5 minutes. I had to leave to pick up my kids and returned the next day only to have the same thing happen again. I needed to file my 2015 and 2014 taxes. I finally got my 2015 taxes finished... only to return an additional 3 times without my 2014 papers being done. They couldnt figure out how to get the tax documents to print. When I got fed up with it and asked for my paperwork back, they tried telling me I had to pay them for my 2014 taxes because they had already "done the work". After arguing with them for about 30 minutes they finally gave me back my taxes which I did myself for free!! I have never been so disappointed with a tax service. To top it off, I was immediately denied for the advance!!
Went in on Jan 21st to file my 2015 taxes with ** (franchise office manager) location address 801 30th street ne canton Ohio 44714. Chose to use the Amex serve card they offer due to the fact I was told I would receive my refund in 5-8 days. Now I am being told that the it's isn't due to start releasing funds until at the earliest Jan 31st. I paid over $300 to file with them and was mislead and lied to about my return.
My fiance went to Jackson Hewitt in November when they had their promotion of a 250.00 loan in November, another 250.00 in December and 600.00 after January 12,2016. He got the one in November but didn't file for the one in December because of the issues he had with the prepay card they gave him. He went this last Thursday for the 600.00. They disregarded the fact that he had already qualified for the 600.00. She did the 750.00 loan instead, he was denied that. So now we don't know what is going to happen to or with his return because the stories I reading on this site. I'm very concerned because he will be less than nice if he doesn't get his income tax back. I will be too. That is our new home. For us and 7 children. He has custody of his 4 and then my 3. His children's mother has nothing to do with those children as my children's father has nothing to do with them and my oldest son's dad is passed away. We don't get to play with the tax money. Like most people we need it to get a place. I'm praying his return doesn't get messed with but as I can see Jackson Hewitt has a lot more loss than the IRS it seems which is scary. On a few of these posts I can tell the preparer had a different card loaded especially the gentleman whom had all the money taken off his card while in the hospital recuperating from an accident. Sad. Really sad. You pay hundreds to have your taxes prepared to protect yourself and some of this stuff. I can't believe especially how they try to sell it to you with the guarantee that they will be the responsible parties. God I hope they did his previous years correctly. When you get big returns you assume they did it right. Now I see that isn't the case and she never turned the screen to see what he was signing. I'm calling first thing in the morning. They are the ones who did not apply him for the correct loan nor did they let him double check the numbers. I didn't think of it because I was fixing their copier/printer that nobody knew how to fix so they basically were going to sit in that office all day and get paid while they turned people away. So the employee Mary ** did not want to wait on us anyway but I offered to fix their printer so her boss said "go ahead and get him started and l will show her the copier." Well I told her and he did numerous times about the 250.00 loan that he qualified for and she did not take it out of his 498.00 in filing fees. SO he paid almost 500.00 doing his obligation of the owing the 250.00 and she did not take it out of the return. Ridiculous because she kept having an error coming across the screen and the older employee said "I haven't seen that so just delete it." Wow is all I can say now and I hope and pray everything turns out alright with his tax return. I'm praying it does. I can't live with his mother much longer so if you believe in prayer you are in mine. So please put family in mind, everyone whom is a Jackson Hewitt. Seeing these horrible reviews they don't guarantee anything even though they smile from ear to ear and obviously lie to your face. Unless the ones whom are hustling people are changing things when they leave. If they had 3 customers pay for the gold package and they pay cash, that is 150.00 that person makes by unchecking that box the min you leave. Sad... Shaking My Head.
My easy tax situation was 519 in fees to qualify for 750 tax advance.. highway robbery! Save your time and money... scamming the poor.
This tax service is the worst yet. Two years in a row they have mislead about promotions. Last year I filed in January and they chose the wrong delivery service of my tax return. Needless to say, I went through hell to have this discrepancy fixed. This year, they have the promotion of 750 dollars of an advance within an hour of filing your taxes. You are supposed to receive a link to apply or log onto the site and apply if you have not received it within the hour. It has been two hours and I have not received a link or able to apply online. I called back to Jackson Hewitt giving them details and they offered a freaking apology that it has to go through the irs first, and they are not sure why the representative told me within an hour. Hello!!! When you are finished filing your taxes, they give you an information sheet for first money center that also verifies you will receive your funds within the hour. This company needs to be more detailed and upfront about these so called promotions. I will never file here again and will discourage others as well.
My husband and I went to Jackson Hewitt and paid a ridiculous amount to have the taxes done. Then in July we got hit with a bill from the IRS saying we owed more money. I have learned now we will go to a credible tax person. Stay away. I would NEVER recommend Jackson Hewitt to anyone.
I went to Jackson Hewitt February 12th to do my federal income tax like I have every year with the company.. But my experience with them was horrible. I did direct deposit but they never put my money in my account. I called Jackson Hewitt about my deposit. They were terrible with me and they didn't know where my money went. I was upset and not happy with their services.. I called the IRD office and they said they had my money... But it was in another account and they still have my money!! It's going to be a year, this happen in 2014... Now they still denying me my money!!! I haven't gotten nothing from these people. I will never ever go them again!!!
Well we went in and filed our taxes this year and the IRS made a mistake. I called JH and ask what I needed to do. They was no help so I called the IRS. It took me a month but I fixed the issue myself and today I called about the loan and they accused me of not getting our refund which we did and then they accused us of not paying them when in fact er took 400.00 cash money in and paid the lady in person and now they said they would have to file some papers. I guess to see if I'm telling the truth. Well we are no thieves and they want their money. Well they have done and got it and if I have to I will hire an attorney to fix this. To all y'all thinking of using Jackson Hewitt y'all might want to think twice!!!
Me and my husband went to Jackson Hewitt to get the year-end loan of 250.00, then in January get a 600.00 advance. Anyways they said "Bring your last pay stub and ID to apply." They also said "No credit check!" So I was like "OK, let's go do this WELL." We went and of course got denied. So all I can say is we were misled to go in there thinking we were going to get this money just to be told "NO!" So as of right now I feel lied to just to get me in the door! I believe they checked my credit cause it's the only explanation for this! They have definitely lost me as a customer!
Thursday I spent about 10 minutes on the phone speaking to a so-called Tax Preparer about these text messages Jackson Hewitt was sending me for a Pre-Qualifying Tax Advance for $250 since I am a returning customer. I was informed since I received an advance last year there was nothing stopping this 0 percent interest advance and I had to apply by the 29th Nov. I went today to do a pre-file for my taxes and the Tax Preparer had me wait 35 minutes to apply through One Money Center. Immediately I received a denial but a Pre-Qualifying notice that I could get $6,00 in January 2016. I called back to Jackson Hewitt and the Tax Preparer said "I do not know anything about denials" and "I do not know what to tell you." I said I need an explanation he said "You will get a letter" and to call One Money Center. I asked for the number. He said "We do not have it. Google it." So I hung up immediately and googled. I found a 817 number and called the Money Center to only receive an automated system that provides on the Jackson Hewitt Call center #. I called that and someone of heavy accent states (after I held for 45 minutes) "Sorry we do not have the money center contact information. You will get a letter in the mail." I said "You are in contract with the Money Center and you do not have contact details." She said "No sorry mam. I cannot give you anything else. Have a good day." Okay so here I am sitting thinking of what the hell is wrong and how I could not qualify for a Tax Advance. Did someone take my identity? Did I fill something in wrong? What do I do? Where do I start? So now I am going to find everywhere, every place that I can tell this horrid story because this was the Worst Customer Service in my life! This is not a joke. This is people's very important information and now it's with some place called a Money Center and they have no contact details! Come on Jackson Hewitt!
I have been going to Jackson Hewitt for many, many years. But my financial aid office red-flagged me because of my 2014 tax return that I used my 2013 as guideline. The office in Kenosha (Can dance) helped me do a amendment to file injured spouse. But (Lori) the supervisor called to see if I had made it there because she felt that it was humorous. I could hear her talking about me over the phone and not only is not professional, it's not funny. Because I come to you guys so that things like this won't happen and it did. Because you had a dishonest woman working for you which I hear she is no longer.
I went to get my taxes done with them after charging me 371.00 for preparing my taxes and by the way the customer service the worst, didn't ask questions like other people do so. After waiting for months (about 5 months), my taxes were done wrong and that's because I got tired and went to IRS to see what was happening. I learn my taxes were done wrong so I had to pay Liberty Tax to fix the problem. They got pay for doing nothing more, they stole my money for not doing their work right. Now what can I do about this?
I would never go back to Jackson Hewitt. When I first arrived the gentleman told me 125.00 and ended up 800.00 later to my surprise. Had no idea I spent that much for a simple C Form. I called to complain, with no avail, nobody could help me. I Just kept getting the runaround. Do not use them if you want to keep your money.
Not only did this company charge outlandish prices, THEY DO NOT LIVE UP TO THEIR ADVERTISING CLAIMS. They had to amend my taxes twice. I submitted taxes for 2014 three times. Jackson Hewitt promises 100% guarantee of accuracy. When I asked them about it, I kept getting jerked around. Oh, and they contacted me at 6:30 p.m. on Tax Day to sign the it's Amended set of taxes. The second amended was a month later. I originally went to them the beginning of February. The business is horrible. Not accurate. They practice under bad faith.
I have been trying to get a hold of a person at the Taylorsville Utah store for a few weeks now regarding a mistake they made on my 2012 taxes that got me audited. I keep getting the runaround from some call center. I have been misdirected, I have been hung up on, I've been lied to. I have never seen such a poor customer service in my life. And I'm getting real close to getting a lawyer. And writing a letter to the editor so everyone knows about this horrible crap.
Took tax paper to the office at Decatur & Ann Road. The Office close before I could get back there with more paper. Call the 800 #, they told me that my sister-in-law tax paper are at the Durango & 95. So I've been to that location 10 times or more. The office is closed. On the door say that it open year round, cannot get a hold of anybody. So how do I get the tax paper from that office. Thank You.
On 4/11/2015 I picked up my 2014 tax return (receipt #**) after being told the computer in their Algonquin Illinois location couldn't e-File my state return. I was also told that the person who did my taxes (Sherry **) was no longer with the company and they had to locate my return and arranged for me to pick it up. I picked up the form and mailed it, they didn't even have envelopes so I had to handle this myself. They had arranged without my knowledge to apply for AR assistance for my return which meant I was charged a bank fee which was in addition to their normal fee. It also meant my refund had to be picked up at their office 30 miles away. I knew none of this. After three month and a call to the IRS I located their office (in an obscure mall with no signs. A local business man had to tell me "they are next to Subway.") I had to sign for my refund and pick it up at their office rather than it being mailed to my home. I have waited 4 months for the promised $50 gift card and all their phones are connected to a computer that doesn't have an answer for cards not received. I called the Schaumburg Illinois office #55060 and spoke with a "Joy" who offered no help nor returned my calls. I would not recommend these folks for anything.
We also had our 2014 taxes done last year with Jackson Hewitt at our Honolulu Walmart with the promise of getting a $100 gift card for doing so. Well here it's August 2015 and we've still not seen it. Practices like this should be illegal. We won't use them again.
An employee of Jackson Hewitt Tax Service located in Lafayette, IN stole my identity by having a friend's sister say she married me, I was the father of her kids, etc. and I was dead, milking the govt. for hundreds of thousands of dollars. They established a mortgage in my name, a car loan, and personal loans. Through thousands of hours of online research I unraveled their puzzle, whereby they would create ancestry files and establish an identity and credit line for the big payoff of selling the house. They would change the middle initials and middle names to move the identity from state to state. But they were not counting on running into an online researcher of ancestral lineage. But what they did accomplish was compromise National Security. My online identity is at Fairchild. My brothers identity is at an undisclosed air base. Both are active duty in-flight refueling squadrons with birds up there. I want my identity back Shane **, Allison **, Crista **.
One of your agents, name Ray at the Ford rd. location in Michigan, overstepped his boundaries by texting a friend of mine with extremely wrong sexual remarks on her cellphone. I'm letting you know because this man has no right to use the info he receives from YOUR clients to harass them. My friend is devastated by this. She still has his text. I told her not to get rid of them, that I would step up and say something on her behalf. If you need to contact me please feel free!!!!!!
We had our taxes for 2013 done at our local office and we got a letter from IRS in 2015 that we owed them $1700 to IRS so we went back to the Jackson Hewitt office and ask, "Why??" They didn't add all of our income in and he had all of our W-2's right in front of him. He told us later that he has never done RR taxes before.
The card JH Preferred is terrible!!!!! I had a transaction I was supposed to receive a refund on that was never put back on my card. Even with the confirmation number from the company I had to do it their way and file a dispute. Did that - waited 45 days. Only to be in hold for half an hour and be told by a rude representative that was apparently eating that I wouldn't be refunded my money and she couldn't say why I wasn't, that wasn't her department and the only way I could contact the dispute was through email. Just brushed me off with no concern. I've been waiting on my refund since March!!!! The most unprofessional, rude people ever. Soon as my feet touch the pavement in the morning I'll be withdrawing all my funds and closing my account and prepare my taxes myself. DO NOT USE THESE PEOPLE!!!!
I went to them because I expected they knew the tax laws. They gave my dependent child tax credit. My dependent turned 17 and couldn't be used. I found out from a letter from the IRS. They sent my taxes electronically and was rejected 4 times. They didn't know why so I had to drive an hour away to have them send it in paper. The same thing was wrong the age of daughter. They said their fees would be deducted from my return and I would be mailed a check. Now they are sending my bill to collections. They also said I would get a email gift for Walmart for 50 dollars and I have not seen it. Also my son in-law hasn't been billed because they received his return but they can't find the money they owe him. I am 60 years old and this has been the worst experience I have ever had with my taxes. They need to be put out of business.
I had my taxes prepared with Jackson Hewitt in 2014. 2 weeks after that I had a bad accident that lead to two brain surgeries and was put into a coma for three months. After two weeks in hospital my tax money came in on a card. By the time I had gotten out of hospital all my money on card was gone. I told this to Jackson Hewitt and they had me write up a dispute paper. It was about a year after I kept calling them and they gave me a big runaround speaking to numerous supervisors. Finally they gave me 500.00 out of 4400.00 and they will not return calls or emails. I will never use this company again and I'm getting a lawyer on this case. Why not? Would they only pay small amounts if I'm entitled to some? Why not all? I will not stop pursuing this money till I see all of it. I had also sent in 40.00 on paperwork from SHANDS hospital on what dates and what had happened to me. They are a horrible, ruthless company that don't mind charging out the ass for services but paying back money that someone stole and you can prove you were incapable of spending. It is not a reputable company at all. BUT IT'S NOT OVER TILL THE FAT LADY SINGS!
2 years after filing Federal return for the year 2013 through Jackson Hewitt, I received a letter from the IRS stating that my return was prepared incorrectly and that I owe $2100.00. My purpose for retaining professional service was to avoid or to minimize the possibility of any mistake. Now that I'm dealing with the aftermath of this, I'm requesting that the preparation fee be refunded to me in the amount of $369.00. I think that this is only fair. What has been offered and given is not satisfactory. I'm not asking for the tax debt to be paid, but only the fee.
I filed my returns and paid for this service in January of 2015. I received my federal in a timely manner but have been waiting for my state to come. Contacted them in April about and nothing was done. Finally got a hold of someone today June 30 and they proceeded to argue with me saying that they were done and to take it up with the state, when in fact I contacted my state IRS and was told they never received my returns from Jackson Hewitt. They continued to argue with me. Very dissatisfied with the level of service. I asked for a refund for the cost of service. So far they have denied me of that.
A Jackson Hewitt tax preparer entered in too much money in social security taxes (box 3). She was supposed to enter 1600.00 give or take and she entered 168,000 into the box so as a result I have to pay back $1300. The only penalties/fines they reimbursed me was $100. After I paid $250 for them to prepare the taxes. They told me that was all I was eligible for was a partial refund of the $250 and a fraction of the penalties/fines I'd accrued so I got a $100 check to help with the $1300 dollars I would have to pay back due to their mistakes and oversight! I'm never dealing with them again!
I been trying to pickup my check for the last week. I got nowhere with that cause they were not open. I called the hot line. They're only on Friday from ten to two. But they did open at all. Come to find they only open the first Friday each month. I think that sucks!! You shouldn't have to wait until the first Friday every month.
Took my mom to do her 2014 taxes. Ok they got submitted on Jan 20th. Said it will be 21 days, ok. Nope. It's now going on 7 months Jackson Hewitt knows nothing. IRS still processing. Really 7 months for an e-file. What is really wrong? They won't call back and charged 300.
10 years ago going through a legal separation Jackson Hewitt convinced me it was ok to sign for my wife's tax return. Big mistake... wife's lawyer threatened me fraudulent tax prep. I had to submit their demands. Huge tax mess followed. Several years ago after I purchased their gold package I was audited. It was their fault because they mistaking added my mortgage interest twice. They never followed through with their gold package promise to reimburse me for fines and penalties. They dragged their feet, stone-walled. Even their corporate office let it slide, never to hear back from them. Most recently they did not itemize my primary home mortgage interests. So now I'm taking it to another tax service. When I first meet with my IRS agent 10 years ago for my audit. He looked at my Jackson Hewitt folder and said that most audits he sees are Jackson Hewitt-related. Good bye Jackson Hewitt!! Long overdue.
I NEED TAX INFO TO BUY A HOUSE. We all know that buying house is stressful enough and my loan has been held up multiple times. My husband called JAC HEW in the morning to find the office that was open (since it's not tax time). I am our only income and I file the taxes so he asked if I needed to be included, he was told no. He went to the office and sure enough they said they needed me to be there but they would 'LET' him get our taxes if I sent a picture of my driver's license. I did send it and yes I used choice language (which was wrong) but we were then told it wouldn't be processed. I work in Customer Service and I get cursed at all day long and it doesn't mean I won't help someone. DON'T USE THIS COMPANY. You can never get any info from them when you need to. It's much smarter and simpler nowadays to efile. Just use TURBOTAX - that way you know it's done AND you get to keep all your info instead of letting someone else ruin your life!!
My boyfriend did his taxes with Jackson Hewitt. They were paid. IRS just accepted his taxes, but no 50 Walmart email gift card has showed up my email.
I filed my taxes with Jackson Hewitt because of the $100 Wal-Mart gift card promotion and because I had used them years past and had no issue. I filed in Colorado with the same Colfax office. It's too long and a mess of a story but Jackson Hewitt is a dishonest, shameful and unprofessional company as a whole, including the tax preps. Half of my Federal has been stolen from me and I am angry and hurt. I am a single, hardworking, honest woman and don't deserve the treatment and anguish I have received from this company and their heartless arrogant reps. I was charged in office a tax prep fee and papers show that yet Jackson Hewitt claims (by email transactions) that the funds they withheld from me is because of fees, which by the way, if true, would over qualify me for the $100 gift card they withheld from me. I contacted them on Facebook and was asked to give my information and I did. I then was told to call a number for their office locally and all would be rectified, which I did but no one answered and their voicemail was always full. So, I called the ''Corporate'' contact, and received the run around so, I emailed them. Was told I did not qualify for gift card (even though I was charged the prep fee twice according to their excuse and reasoning). So I emailed about my federal refund being short and was told that The Treasury Offset and IRS had withheld my funds, so I called both and was told by The Treasury that I have no debts with them, called The IRS and was told the same and that my account shows that they sent AND authorized Jackson Hewitt to give me my FULL AMOUNT. So, I relayed the info back to Jackson Hewitt and opened a ''claim'' and was assured that I would receive a call from a rep who would ''straighten up this embarrassing mess of a mistake to a valued customer'' (I record all of my calls) but no one called that day. The next day a rep called from my local office (by this time the office itself is permanently closed.. strange) but as soon as I would answer they would hang up and when I called back, no answer and full voicemail. Now I am upset, so I call the IRS back and received an Agent ID of the rep and was told to open a Civil Case. I email ALL transaction and proof to Jackson Hewitt, even all of their contradictory excuses, and was now told that my refund was held because I owed them a prep fee and the extra cost is because I filed electronically? Which still doesn't entitle them to the amount they kept because I already paid them. I can't believe how dishonest and blatant they are when I have PROOF of all. I think we should all get together and file a large Civil case against them because this cannot be coincidence. I don't understand but I will fight for every penny that I believe I am owed. I am also calling the BBB on them. So, all in all, they charged me twice for prep, cheated me out of the ''instant'' $100 Wal-Mart gift card and taken my Federal Refund funds. This cannot be tolerated.
We used JH to file our 2014 taxes. The tax preparer who filed the taxes claimed they were the most experienced in the office. They informed us that we were getting a $3,000.00 tax return from the IRS but comparing this to last year's taxes, it seemed inaccurate so we called our financial advisor who found multiple errors, and we ended up owing $5,000 which the IRS is now requesting. We called and informed JH of these errors and they claimed that the retirement form 1099R was incorrect and that the previous employer needed to pay for any error. The JH tax preparer had not adhered to Form 721 publication and left out critical tax calculations. They have not honored the "gold guarantee" which we paid extra for although this is solely the tax preparer's error. The guarantee supposedly covers up to $5,000.00 if they made an error. They are now dragging their feet, arguing something that is black and white and they are not prompt at returning calls in four weeks of them claiming they would update us per week and that they were unaware of a new company rule on the guarantee. This is after emailing main headquarters. Will not use them again. Horrible and unreliable.
I've been doing my taxes with JH for the past 4 years and will never use them again. I visited a Walmart location and sat with I thought a seasoned rep but unfortunately I was wrong. I knew there was going to be an issue when he explained to me that I was not going to receive my child tax credit which was false, I had to review his screen in order to correct the information. I had to leave without my paperwork and to later receive a phone call stating my w2 were missing. I contacted their headquarters and was promised my tax preparation fee within 6 to 8 weeks. It has been 6 months.
Went to have taxes filed n a Walmart facility. After being with this company for over 20 years, I go and file, anticipated a return. Instead I owe the IRS. They hired this dumbass rep, ** (if you recognize her name - please Don't trust her. She will have you paying instead of receiving!!!) who sent in some personal notes about my family situation and now I have to pay in. It's a damn shame after 20+ years of doing business with them, I can no longer trust their services nor will they ever get my services again. My advice to new comers, even old comers, go through someone else. From now on, I'm returning back to H&R Block. I never had any problems with them. I simply went to JH because of my mom. I will NEVER go back to JH. I'm strictly H&R from 2015 on. JH won't even correct the problem or even try. Their guarantees ain't **. Please believe.
Me and my wife had our 2013 and 14 taxes done at Jackson and Hewitt and they done them wrong both years. Now we owe the IRS over 3000.00. I do not recommend anyone using this tax service
On April 15, 2015, I went to Jackson Hewitt Taxes at the Fulton Rd office (nightmare). I forgot to add a W-2 form to my taxes and I didn't get all my copies for my taxes, missing the schedule A the itemized form. I have tried calling over a month the 1-800 #'s, the Fulton office, with no response. I need this information to complete my taxes. I seriously need help from someone to get this done! Thank you.
False advertising at the Jackson Hewitt in Bradenton Florida. I was charged $261.00 for a simple tax preparation and was told that I was given a $100 discount, otherwise my cost would have been $361.00. I was told after the taxes were prepared that I would not receive the $50 Instant Visa Card to be used at Walmart. I feel mislead and cost of service was outrageously expensive for services rendered. I've never paid such prices even for a private tax appointment. Since I was out of the state and live in Wisconsin, I didn't have too many options available. Never again!! Shame on Jackson Hewitt. No resolution after I complained. No follow-up from tax person after he said he would notify me regarding my request for the Visa card, per advertisement. Buyer Beware!!
I made an appt. to have my taxes done at JH in the Hilo, HI walmart on Feb 16, 2015 @ 10 am. The first tax lady showed up around 10:20 am. She tells me I have to wait for someone else to come cause she can't help me. At around 10:40 someone finally comes in who can help me. So I ask her why the first lady could not help me and she said, "That accountant will not do taxes when she's alone because she was afraid." I thought to myself, "OMG!" So I did my taxes and paid the outrageous fees, $400 and I left. On April 13 I called to see the status of my state returns because the state tax website said they did not receive my tax forms. Well coincidentally, the next day the state tax office says they just received it. So I am upset and go to JH for proof of the day they e-filed my state returns. Of course they could not show such proof, but I was told that will call me the minute they receive my check so I can pick it up. Well it's may 7th and I get a text that my check is ready to be picked up in Honolulu, that's on another island. WTH! They will not mail it to me till I show an I.D and sign a paper then I can have my check. Is this really what I paid all those fees for. They could have informed me ahead of time that they were closing the Hilo office. That's why I paid the assisted refund. Quicker and more convenient. They will not try to accommodate me at all and are very rude and inconsiderate. I told them they could shove the check up their ** and I will never do business again with them and neither will anyone else I know. Never, never, never again!
My husband and I filed our taxes in Jan. We were very happy when we had filed. Then weeks go by. Now it had been 3 months. The IRS says everything has been processed. We are now calling Jackson Hewitt to find out where our money is and the lady doesn't seem to know anything and will not give us her name or transfer us to someone who could help us. And all the IRS says is that we need to talk to Jackson Hewitt. We had also made it very clear to them that we wanted it in check form, not a direct deposit and they set it up for a wire transfer. We are very unhappy and no one seems to know where our money is and it is now May!!!
I went into a Wal-Mart - was going to use this company to prepare my 2014 TAX Return. They guaranteed the best return amount over their competitors. After I had their Tax Professional look at my return he provided a cost amount. It was already a lot higher than my previous tax professional. I then politely told Jackson Hewitt their guarantee need to be taken down and left the small cubicle at Wal-Mart. It has now been three months and Jackson Hewitt wants me to pay a $60.00 set down fee to them. What an complete scam. I even called the person who created the bill and they will not terminate the bill. I would not use this company in any form for tax issues.
First off I had my taxes done through Jackson Hewitt. OK I received a tax ID pin number in the mail so I take all my information including the spin number to Jackson Hewitt. I has been told that that was not necessary and we did not need it - the tax ID number that is. Now since I've been waiting on my money for 2 months I've been told it "yes we did need that number." And now I'm having problems getting a hold of anybody to correct the situation and they kept the document. So good luck to all of you who are using Jackson Hewitt - may your experience be better than mine.
Went in to file taxes Feb 2 2015. Before we started, asked preparer if I need additional papers because I had enrolled in Obama's healthcare. She stated, "No we should be fine." Well we filed, got estimates. Figured they're professionals so some twenty-one days have paused, called asking about return that states pending. Was told to contact IRS. Finally got a hold IRS. They stated since I received Obama care, I needed to file paperwork with it, the same paperwork I had asked if I needed to wait on. They informed me I would have to file a form 8962 or something and mail/fax info back to them so went back to JH, informed them of letter I received asking to be completed and filled out. Well preparer acts like she doesn't even know what she looking at. I informed her I need to get form 8962 and also assistance filling it out since I have no idea what it is. Well left my copies of IRS letter and she stated she would get someone to help me. They called back stating they filled everything out and I can come and get it to fax. Well I got there, they handed me 1 paper with my name, social, stuff I could have filled out bhai it no form 8962 stating they gave me a copy yes so I could look at it so I had to have someone else fill it out since they did not want to yet trying to get full filing cost even though as they GUARANTEE 100% accurate filing and they did nothing.
I got a letter from the IRS about my 2012 taxes I had filed by JH in Virginia. Apparently I did not qualify for a credit that I had received and I owed the money back along with interest and penalties. Since then I have moved to Texas, so I took my letter and tax info to a JH in Texas, and they found the problem. The preparer did not fill in a certain box that needed to be filled in, which immediately changed the fact that indeed did not qualify for that credit and should have never received that money. I paid the money back along with all fees and interest. The Texas JH sent the Virginia JH all my information about the mistake so I could get the penalties and interest paid back to me since their employee had filed them incorrectly. This was in October. It is now April. No one will answer my phone calls, return my messages, or emails. I have filed two complaints where someone was supposed to contact me within 24-48 hours. I am still waiting and it's now been 5 days since my last filed complaint. JH owes me back the 153 dollars I paid, and I am all out of ideas on how to get it back. This is by far the worst customer service I have ever dealt with.
I was charged $334.00 to do my taxes. It took her 20 minutes. I had 1 additional form 1099. I had no deductions. My taxes would not go then because they needed a EIN # on the 1099. I tried calling, left voice mail, no one called me back. It must have gone thru without but I was charges a additional $20.00 on my credit card without my approval. What gives here?
I allowed Jackson Hewitt in Bristol VA the first of March 2015 and am still waiting on my refund of $2103.00. I have called the office at Walmart numerous times to be told "it should be any day." I went to the Walmart location on 4/16 to find it gone. I'm called the number and it still goes to a voicemail for that location. I called the customer service number to be told that I would have to call the regional office which is only opened for a few hours on Monday and Tuesday and is 3 hours away. After speaking to at least 3 supervisors, no one can tell me how I will get my refund check that I was to pick up at the local office when it arrived. I will never use this tax service again. The only choice I have now is to go to my local tax office and see what the hold up on my refund is.
I went to Jackson Hewitt at the Wal-Mart in Arlington, Wa. All went well, although the woman that prepared my taxes wasn't very professional and her appearance was that of someone who rolled out of bed and headed straight to work. My big complaint may seem small compared to others, but it has me steaming regardless... I was given a coupon that stated if I referred a friend, I would receive a $25 check that would be mailed to me. Well, it's been 3 months now and I've received no check! I went in and questioned the woman that did my taxes and she said "Yes, you should get $25. Did you request a Wal-Mart gift card or a mailed check?" I wasn't even given the option! 2 weeks later, still no check. So again, I go back to Wal-Mart and question the same woman and she asks me the same question about how I requested to receive my $25! She goes on to tell me that it's a new offer that started this year and she wasn't sure if Jackson Hewitt waits until the tax season is over before sending out the $25! This is information these "so called professionals" should know! Of course the direct number I was given to call was a complete waste of time as well... Funny how not one person I spoke to can give me an answer! So now I wait, tax season is now over, I'll see if it arrives in the mail soon. I will never use Jackson Hewitt to file my taxes again, and neither will my friends or family. I'm going back to H&R Block or will do it on the internet.
We took our mentally challenged son to get his taxes done for the first time. He is 58. He is a janitor at Arby's for 15 hours a week and has SS disability. He was to get a $600 refund but had to pay 349 to have a short form tax return done. You got 45% of his refund. I hope you all sleep well cheating the mentally challenged people like that.
I got my taxes done at our local Wal-Mart Jackson Hewitt and when I got them done, the gentleman told me I could have my check sent there and be able to come right there to pick it up. But when I get the call that my check was in, I was going to have to pick it up in Delaware, Ohio which is an hour from where I live. I tried calling that location 2 hours before I went there and no one answered. I get there, the people were rude and said I was lucky because my check just got there I had to spend 40 in gas to go there and deal with rude-ass people when I had to make a drive that I was told I wouldn't have to make, then having to pay the fees to disperse check, etc. Not happy - they never even tried to make customer happy. Worst customer service ever. I have been in customer service for many years and could never imagine treating people this way. I even asked if they would give me a 50.00 Wal-Mart card for all the hassle, the lady walked away. I will never come back to you guys again because of the unprofessionalism I was given. I can take my things back to H&R Block.
This is probably the worst tax company I ever dealt with. Very unprofessional staff, they couldn't answer any of my questions, don't believe any of their prices advertises, it is all a scam. Before we started, she said it will cost me approximately $100 after she did all, she said their fee is $362. When I refused to pay the amount, I ended up paying $35 "consultation fee". Horrible service, have no idea what they are doing. It is a big scam. Don't go there!
Cx my efile due to an error that would not allow me to efile my taxes. Issue not resolved. Rep said provide cc info and I will send to my mgr for a refund. Later, JH said they do not offer refunds once you have used. They would not allow me to reopen.
Went into Corbin, KY office to file taxes. Took around three hours which I find extremely too long. In the end, we had to file an extension because they did something wrong causing us unable to efile. I find this unacceptable for a tax office. The so called manager had to make several calls to figure some things out on the tax forms and still in the end was unable to file our taxes. An employee's incompetence is bad enough much less a manager with not enough knowledge to be running a tax office. If this is the kind of employees and managers Jackson Hewitt hires, I then to have question their judgement on all their business practices.
My wife tried to file online. She stopped in the middle and saved. When she went back to finish she couldn't log in because the upper case captcha letters kept switching to lower case after typing them. After trying for a while and in different browsers, there was a message that the account was locked for too many failed attempts. Numerous calls were placed to them. The phone people had NO CLUE. Their recommendation: log in to the account and chat with support. AS IF they did not listen to anything we said about the problem being unable to log in. NEVER AGAIN WITH JACKSON HEWITT.
Jackson Hewitt is a scam and a big rip-off! When I made an appointment to have my taxes prepared, I asked how much it cost and was told between $35.00 for a simple return to $160.00 for a complicated one. I had all my info tallied up ahead of time, and all the preparer had to do was put it in the computer. After 2 hours, he was finally done, and when he told me it was going to cost $493.00, I almost fell over! My previous accountant never charged over $250.00, but we relocated to a new town and it was too far to use him. What a joke! I had a refund of $900.00 and he asked did I want it to be taken out of the refund or how did I want to pay! Unbelievable!!! I have never felt so ripped off in my life! The tax preparer even said he was sometimes embarrassed to work for Jackson Hewitt due to their exorbitant fees. They will never get another chance to steal my hard earned money. I wish I had read all of these negative reviews before entrusting my taxes to them. Heed my advice, do NOT trust them!
I went to Jackson Hewitt many of years and I have to say this year I was not satisfied at all!!! They did my taxes and sent me on my way!!! I paid for the gold guarantee so I paid $512.95. I was informed that by me getting the gold guarantee that it helps just in case I get audited they would deal with that for me!! So I called a month after I filed my taxes because I didn't receive a call or anything from them to let me know I had to do additional paperwork because I had been audited so I go in and they help me with that. So another two weeks went by and I called to ask about my check and a lady told me that they didn't have it yet and that I didn't have to call up there asking for anything because they will call me if they had anything for me! I stated to her that I had paid them to help me with what ever I needed and she had a job to do!! She stated that I hadn't paid them anything which I have because my state taxes came in and they kept that check! So then I called and spoke with management! Still no help! Till this day I have been dealing with the IRS MYSELF. I will never in my life go back to them - they have very poor customer service and they only care about collecting money!! And they lie because me paying that extra money meant nothing!
Due to someone making a mistake on my taxes, I had to take my state form in to ask a question before mailing them, the office I went to is located in GA and it strikes me as odd that the woman who was doing taxes for your company, didn't seem to know much about GA State Income Tax Forms, my first clue was when she said "I wonder if you can use white out on a tax form?" And she was being serious!!! And then she saw that I had a Georgia Tax Book and she ask me where I got the book, so I told her I called a telephone number and ask for one, if she is doing people's taxes, why didn't she know that??? Then while I was there, the telephone rang and the man in the office with her, who didn't have a customer, wouldn't answer the phone!!! She had to stop what she was doing and answer the phone!!! And she kept saying "it's done differently up where I'm from" or else she would say "we never had to do this up where I'm from." I just hope she did everything correctly!! It just seemed like there was a lot about the GA State Tax Form that she didn't know, and if you're working in a GA Tax Office- you should know about Ga taxes!!!! I will not be going back to that office.
I went to Jackson Hewitt in Walmart Ellicott City, MD. The tax preparer seemed unfamiliar with the setup of the space and equipments. I filled out the client sheet and the preparer proceeded to file my taxes. Now comes the not so good part. The printer could not print, credit card machine was offline and there was no connection we could see. Now I had to pay $275.00 a short not itemized taxes. Then I observed many errors the preparer made. The preparer had to call at least two different people to make corrections. Bottom line since the copier was not working and I had to leave after spending three hours with the tax preparer, still no copies of my filed taxes. I was told my copies would be emailed to me. I wouldn't recommend this location. Tax Preparer is not well trained and $275.00 is too much for a non-itemized taxes.
I filed my taxes with Jackson Hewitt in Walmart here in Pasco on Feb, 26. The never received the $50.00 they promised in their advertisement. I was told that I did not receive the fifty dollar email because I owed the IRS which was paid that day with my debit card.
Their website claimed their software could complete my federal and state (Oregon) tax returns. However, when I reviewed my Oregon return, I noticed a significant credit was missing. When I contacted customer service, I was informed that their software does not support all state credits. They expressed no interest in fixing the problem and suggested that I complete the Oregon form manually.
I was charged $563.00 for a 1040 with deductions on April 10, 2015, and this is more than double charge that I have ever paid in 40 years. This is more than I paid when I ran a business and this was an individual return. There is something definitely wrong with this picture, and I asked the preparer "why?" Her reply was "Obamacare". Through a federally mandated healthcare system, that I owe my tax preparation overcharge too and I do not believe this. The local franchisee is who I blame for overcharging me and Jackson Hewitt is who I blame. There is too much grey area in pricing when it comes to tax preparation and it needs to be investigated. I have called my congressman to complain!
Had my taxes done at the Clifton Park NY office. Never ever again. First of all they are big ripoffs. Got my federal tax back more than a month ago, no state. Going back, they charged me almost half of what I'm supposed to get back from the state. I questioned it and was told it's based on the forms used. I didn't have any more forms this year than in the past. Called NY state and they wanted certain information. I pulled the paperwork that I received and there was only a summary page and only 2 pages for the federal. What the heck is this? Called Jackson Hewitt (Albany) and they said I got everything I needed. I paid all that money, I should have all the paperwork. They said that if I wanted all papers, it was my job to request them. I don't think so, they should have given them to me at the time. They then told me after someone in that office hung up on me twice, that I can go by and pick them up. Convenience, they should get them to me. On the 8th of April, they finally agreed to mail them on the 9th, haven't got them yet. So now there's more of a holdup calling the state. I hope no one ever uses them!
We did our taxes with Jackson Hewitt for the last 15 years. This year they were giving out $100.00 Walmart cards. We did our taxes on the 7th of March and haven't seen the card that they said would come in my email. If y'all can't do what y'all advertise then don't advertise. You have just lost yourself a good customer cause I don't do business like this!!!!! Good bye Jackson Hewitt!!! To me y'all should have had the cards at the store ready to hand out. Office # 50765.
We got no return this year. We were charged 335 dollars and some odd cents. I left crying. Even tax preparer stated we did not make very much money last year. Now this is with a discount. Oh we got a 50.00 dollar gift card to Wal-Mart. We have been struggling last two years then got hit with that amount I almost fainted as I said. I left in tears. We get a check once a month so we are screwed money-wise now. Terrible! Will not return next year or ever again. Plenty of places out there that would be more than happy to help. Next year I refuse to be reduced to tears over amount owed!!! I want to stop check and thinking about it hard.
When we went into Jackson Hewitt to have our taxes prepared we spoke with the preparer and let her know that we had a small past due amount to the IRS. This was from taxes not being taken from unemployment. We discussed the IRS Fresh Start program for past due debts. The preparer stated that that's not what we needed to do that we needed to file our current return and then come back and amend a past year return. This was completely false and then accurate. Instead of paying $75 to the IRS we now owe over $1000. When I contacted Jackson Hewitt about the problem and asked for them to at least refund our fees partially or in whole they said they would put in a request. It's been 6 weeks we haven't heard anything. The manager said we would hear something within 6 weeks if it was refunded otherwise they wouldn't contact us no matter what. This is poor customer service. They charged us 500 plus dollars to do a return and now we owe more money to the IRS and have to pay somebody else to correct the situation. This is the worst tax help ever. I feel I have been robbed.
Went to Jackson Hewitt to have taxes prepared. I asked why we had not gotten the $50 Wal-Mart gift card. I was told that since my tax refund was erased out and the preparer had to reinput my info that is why the system did not give it to me. I contacted Jackson Hewitt home office. Was told it was because I had to have at least $150 in their fees. In fact I have paid $507.00 in their fee (after being told it was around $400.00). I did not tell anyone to erase my info, was not told about any stipulations, and the sign does not say anything except "Get your taxes done here and get $50 gift card for Wal-Mart." This is false advertising. Does anyone know of a Tax Attorney that would take this to court? The address of this office for Jackson Hewitt is: 7200-6 Normandy Blvd, Jacksonville, FL 32205, 904-777-1040.
Jackson Hewitt Tax Service, Tax Preparation Service; Address: Cross County Plaza, 4294 Okeechobee Blvd, West Palm Beach, FL 33409; Phone:(561) 296-3194. Tax Return Customer Service was horrid. The problem started here. The woman on the phone stated I do not qualify to use the EZ forms because I make over $25,000 a year. The EZ form that I brought to the office clearly states cannot use if income is over $99,200 a year. Your team at the above location filed the long forms for me which I feel increase my odds of an audit. She was also very rude on the phone and refused to print or show me a receipt of what I was being charged for since the total bill was $571.00. I live overseas and work as a contractor on a Navy Base. I flew in to West Palm Beach, Florida on Friday April 3rd, 2015 morning to immediately go get my taxes filed. I have used Jackson Hewitt before when I worked at Camp Lejeune and other years. I have always had excellent service and would recommend your services to everyone. Until this year. I walked into the office a little after 1100 and you had 3 people out front ready to serve with no wait or delay. I immediately when politely am asked “how can we help you” respond with “I live overseas and have to file Foreign earned income, I brought the appropriate 2555 EZ and F1040EZ with me.” They are very pleasant and willing to help. I ask “Does anyone have experience filing foreign earned income.” The lady, ** assists me until she cannot go any further. The system has stopped her at this point and she needs help. The woman on her left asks a few questions before we started she told ** if she had any questions she could walk her through them. This is the only reason I agreed to sit down for an hour to get my taxes done instead of just going to another office, I feel you can determine your own clarity and knowledge on your ability to do my taxes. I have lived overseas for over 10 years with a year break. I have done them before but just wanted to avoid the hassle this year. So ** calls the General Manager and the CPA for this office to no avail. She is told they are driving and on vacation due to the Easter Holiday weekend. This was more than a little upsetting to me because it is a week before filing is due. I understand people have families and it is Good Friday, but I went into the city not the small town tax office for that reason. ** is very calm and apologizes, she looks flustered she cannot go on but assures me that the CPA will come in and take care of it and they will call me. I tell them “I fly out on Tuesday morning April 7th and I cannot physically be there but I do have email and a fax machine to sign the forms.” She makes copies and scans everything I brought in including the 2555EZ and 1040EZ forms that clearly state at the top to be used if you make less than $99,200.00 which I am really far away from. I brought in all my flight dates on an excel sheet organized. You can pull my records they scanned them all in and attached them to my file. When ** tells me that the CPA is coming to do my taxes I immediately think “oh this is going to cost a ton”. The same 3 people are still at their desks the helpful Hispanic woman on ** ‘s left assures me it won’t cost like $500 or anything just because the CPA is doing them. I consider should I go elsewhere or take my chances and have faith. Saturday April 4th, 2015. ** calls my cell phone and tells me to come in when I can they close in 20 minutes but my taxes are completed and ready to be signed. I explain “I am over 20 miles away from the office.” She notifies me they are not open Sunday. I tell her “of course I understand it is a holiday. I will come by Monday as soon as I wrap up all my already scheduled appointments.” We only get so many flights a year so we cram in as many medical/dental/ personal appointments we can into our days in the US plus try to see family. Monday April 6th, 2015 around 1600 I go into the office for my tax paperwork. ** is not working, the only one I recognize is the woman who was sitting to ** ‘s left. When I walk in they call me over to her desk and she looks up and states "No I am leaving in minutes I can’t take her". I am standing a foot in front of her desk I was just called over to. She hands the keys over to the new woman I didn't get her name. We sit down and she tells me my bill is $236. For filing??? I am astonished and ask “what for exactly?” She tells me “for filing”. I question her, “It is just 4 forms, the most I recall ever paying is $25.00 per form ever, even when I worked as a paralegal making a lot more money than today while raising a child and going for my bachelor’s degree.” Basically a lot of write offs I do not have today as a single woman working overseas no dependents, no property tax exempt. She offers to call the woman who completed the forms I assume the CPA? I state “Yes, please call.” I do not know who I was speaking with on speaker phone. She asks the woman behind the desk several times to take me off of speaker phone. I keep asking her “what is the break down of these charges” and she just says “for the forms”. That $142.75 per form you realize? I quickly did the math and realized. So she says “no that is all 6 forms” well that is still over $95 per page? I ask her to print off what I am being charged for exactly. She again refuses to show me the break down of charges? When I ask her to explain why she didn't use the EZ forms she repeats I do not qualify and she doesn't have my file in front of me. I explained “I have the paperwork in front of your co-worker and she can see the top of the form clearly states under $99,200 per year earned.” The charge was $571.00 for the 4 forms. Since this office refused to show me what the charges were for exactly, I walked out and will tell 300 other people here and everywhere this story. I have worked customer service for 20 years and I know that one angry customer tells 30 people one happy customer tells one to five. That was before the age of social media. I am now filing my own taxes with unreliable internet because I am overseas working on a military base. Am I looking at the wrong forms I pulled from the IRS website that show I can use EZ forms. And why wouldn't you show your customer a breakdown of work performed? I audit everything to make sure it is right before I turn it in. I don't feel I should get screwed because I am too lazy to fill out 4 forms. I think I should get charged but not $571.00, let's be real. I worked for tax attorneys that only would charge you $250/hr.
It did not begin well. I arrived 10 minutes before my reserved appointment and was told by employee she didn't have it on schedule. I said I'd be happy to leave if it was a problem. Five minutes after we begin, another angry customer showed and the two of them were having a disagreement about what time his appointment was. She said he was late, he said he was on time. Meanwhile, there I sit. I had prepared my Federal but I wanted "the professionals" to prepare it from scratch in case I had made any errors. When we were finished, I wrote a check for the preparation of taxes and left. Two hours later I get a phone call asking me if I had left the check with her. I stated yes I had. She can't find it, could I double check, yes I've done that I say. Well I can't find it she says. That is a problem I say--my bank account number is out there somewhere because of your slack handling. She says she's sorry and could I put a stop payment and come by with another check? Now I'm really upset so I call her boss who says she'll speak with employee. The employee calls me back to say she had some other worker look for it and it has been found. Boss calls me back to say it's been found and employee will not get paid. Too bad my day has been ruined and I got nothing but "sorry." Not good enough. Most unprofessional and I won't recommend them--and they don't care. Horrible service and almost compromised by bank account, after all it could have been stolen since it was not handled securely.
Appears trainee prepared returns, as older gentleman sat and stood by tax preparer throughout the 1 hr. 20 min. we were there. Simple short forms filled. Bill for prep of 2013 taxes was $126.00. Bill presented on April 4th was $296.00! My wife and I were shocked. Same standard deductions as last year except for installation of an energy efficient door. My wife and I voiced our shock and utter disbelief. The older gentleman said he would check with someone (make a call) and, after a time, advised the bill was $246.00. Something is definitely wrong with this kind of increase, and my wife and I will have nothing to do with JH in the future.
We had our tax return prepared at jackson hewitt tax service. We were required to pay $282.00 cash up front at the time of service because we were also having an injured spouse form filed with the return. Our return was filed electronically. We were notified by the irs that our tax return would be deposited into our account on February 25th. On February 28th we were notified by the irs that the whole entire refund was kept (including the injured spouse portion). After notifying jackson hewitt of this we were told that the injured spouse form was rejected by the irs because the tax preparer did not answer a few questions that he should have answered. Jackson Hewitt has refiled an amended tax return-by mail. It is now April 3rd and our amended Tax return is-still-processing. We have been told by the IRS office that it could take until MAY 13th for the-mailed- amended return to finish processing. This has been an awful experience that could have been avoided if the injured spouse form had of been filed correctly with the first electronic file on February 14th!!! We paid $282 cash at the time of service for our tax preparation and for the "Injured Spouse Form" to be filed along with our return--and--I feel that we did not receive the entire service that we paid for because the injured spouse claim form was not even filed correctly!!! I will not recommend anyone to Jackson Hewitt tax service!!! We have been told that our tax return next year will be prepared free of cost -- ok that is a nice gesture however this experience has caused us a lot of stress and complications due to not having received our tax refund in a timely manner!!!...Thank You. Extremely disappointed. :(
Portage Avenue Jackson Hewitt south bend. I prepared taxes and just went in for them to file them electronically and was charged almost 400. How do you get away with that. Took fees and taxes did not come. Why is your company scamming people for money they don't deserve? I thought efile was free. It cost just as much as if they were prepared by your agent. Paperwork was taken into the office with all the information as well.
We were not greeted at all even though when we walked in the door I said, "hello, how are you?" to each of the 3 workers. The person who finally waved us never greeted or even introduced herself. The entire time we were there it was extremely uncomfortable and we were treated as though we were interrupting, even though we made an appointment. As for accuracy I can't say because she was unable to complete our taxes and we haven't heard back yet (that was 2 days ago).
Jackson Hewitt charged me twice as much as any other agency. Additionally they took $42.00 extra dollars that were not discussed or calculated on the hard copy report I signed along with the preparer. I called the location I filed and spoke with the branch manager who was undereducated and could not tell me what went wrong, she had to contact her supervisor. After doing that she called me back to inform me that her supervisor also had no idea what was going on but they would send me a $42.00 refund check within 6-8 weeks. They "stole" $42.00 from me and I have to wait 2 months to get it back? Furthermore, I received a refund check this week (filed February 2nd) and the refund was for $15.95 NOT $42.00. I strongly recommend not trusting them to get you the most back. Personal experience, they take most of your money and then try to sneak extra. HORRIBLE BUSINESS!
My wife, ** and I are having some serious issues with your company at the moment. I posted a very negative review on Jackson Hewitts Facebook page and had an immediate response from a representative. They told me to contact customer service to let them know what happened and promised me this would all be rectified. I did as they asked and spoke to someone on Friday afternoon. The person I spoke to took my statement and all my info and informed me that someone from the "corporate" office would be contacting me within 24 hours. I agreed and anticipated their call. I received no such call. It is now 4 days later and still no call. I commented this on my original review and another representative gave me this email and said you should be able to get my problem resolved or at least get my complaint heard by the correct people. So here it is... My wife and I have done our own taxes for several years. Well 3 years ago we made a costly mistake on our taxes. It cost us around $20,000. We got a hold of the IRS and formed a contract to make monthly installments to pay this money. We decided we should let the professionals do our taxes from now on. So last year was our first year with Jackson Hewitt. We had an extremely pleasant experience with our tax lady. We used the branch in North port at the walmart. Our refund was around $7500.00 which would put a huge dent in what we owe. She told us that Jackson Hewitt would get their cut and the IRS would take the rest until our debt was settled. This was great news to us. Well tax time again this year and we decided to go to the same place. You guys were doing the $50 e-gift card to walmart so we thought why not. We called to make an appointment and made sure we would qualify for the gift card. Our appointment was for this past Friday and we showed up a few minutes early just in case. Our representative, ** was late by a few minutes. No problem though as we did not have any other plans. We started in on the taxes and that's when it went downhill. She informed us that we owed money to Jackson Hewitt from last year for the preparation of our taxes totaling over $300 and we would not be able to file anything until that and the $300 plus for this visit were paid that day. We were floored. Not a single notice, bill, or phone call was made to us regarding this. My wife and I talked it over and decided to go ahead with it because there was not much we could do. We have to get our taxes done. I could not focus the rest of the time there. I was furious. She finished up with our taxes and that's when it went even further downhill. We were told we owed over $3000.00. When we asked why she said it's cause we made over $105,000.00 between the 2 of us. Granted we did not make quite that much last year but it didn't make sense how we could go from "getting back" to owing that much. My wife, at that point, was having a mild panic attack. I asked ** to show me how that was figured out. When she got to line 62 on the taxes it showed a figure of $11,000.00. She wasn't sure how that got there and had to call her boss to remote in on her computer to figure it out. Apparently she chose the wrong thing in that field. It should have been a D and not a B there or something to that affect. So that was strike 2. We went back to getting $7500.00 back. Granted it's all going to the IRS anyway. So now in order to file we have to pay her a little over $700.00. She said we could pay $650.00 instead cause she wanted to give us a bit of a discount for the troubles. That was nice. Then I brought up when we would be getting our $50.00 gift card. Her reply was "which one would you like, a gift card or the discount. You can't have both." Strike 3. We put our taxes on hold and made an appointment for April 4th at 10 am. I was very reluctant to write this email because I don't think customer service is the way it used to be. I have tried 3 different avenues for someone to hear me out. I will pay the money owed on the 4th. I have no problem paying my debts. And I will complete my taxes through Jackson Hewitt but next year remains to be seen. However I will let as many people as I can know about my service through this company.
I have dealt with Jackson Hewitt for 2 yrs. I filed my income tax with them on jan 29th. Everything went through. Here it is march 25th 2015 and my refund is still being processed. That is all they can tell me. I will never go to them again.
I have low income. That is clear on my W-2. Yet I was charged a ridiculous amount for my tax prep! They told me it was because of a certain form I had. That one form cost me a bunch of money! How nice for them. When I asked a call center representative why, she told me it was part of a "package" and could not break down the cost form by form, which is what I wanted to know. My tax preparer put in the wrong email address, so I did not get my Walmart gift card. So basically it was sent to someone else! Now I have to go to Walmart, have them print the card, and then I can use it. My tax preparer had to call almost a dozen times to ask someone what to do! I can see needing help on a few questions, but not a whole bunch! I went to Liberty Tax last year. It was a professional environment, much cheaper, and my tax preparer did not look like he just rolled out of bed!!!
We were charged $875 to have our taxes done. This was for two short forms. Complete ripoff.
I filed my taxes on Feb. 2nd, 2015 at the Jackson Hewitt office in Topeka, Ks. The appt was the last of the day and although our tax preparer was nice, she also seemed rushed. Since I wanted my refund deposited to my Walmart paycard, I was asked to give routing and account #s. I had asked my employer for this information and they printed it out for me, which I provided. I knew that student loans would take all of my federal which left me $938 from state. JH informed me after all was said and done that they would be taking $403 out of that for their fees and that it would take 5-7 days for IRS to release it and an additional 3 days for JH's to release it to my bank. I learned of a $130 set off which delayed it an additional week. I received an email on March 17th from JH stating that my refund would be on my paycard within 72 hours - it wasn't. JH didn't seem to care where my money was - their $403 fee was already in their bank. C/S from my paycard said they had no transactions. I asked them to verify the information on my tax forms and I learned that JH had entered the wrong account info - the 2nd # was off by one digit (a 2 instead of a 3). I called JH and spoke with the office mgr. She informed me that it was my mistake, claiming that I had written the information down incorrectly. When I told her that it was a printed document from WM, she basically called me a liar, denying any wrong-doing by the tax preparer, claiming that it was MY handwriting. Funny how I hadn't written on the document at all. She then informed me that once WM's bank couldn't find the proper account # that it would be sent back to JH's bank and that there was nothing to be done since it was my mistake - that they weren't liable and wouldn't be releasing my refund! That it was my loss. I ended up calling JH's bank and they informed me that this frequently happens and gave me a trace # to give to WM's bank. I did this and my refund was on my card within six hours! I'm thankful that I got my refund but I'm absolutely furious with the incompetent service and unprofessional manner that this particular office gave me. I have filed a complaint with JH main office and demanded that I get the $403 fee back. Good riddance to JH and thank goodness for karma.
I am new to US and had to file my tax for the first time. I contacted Jackson Hewitt and the lady named ** did the filling for me. To my bad luck, she was the most horrible person to this thing. Day 1, she filled in the forms and told me that I'll be getting X amount of dollars as refund and she charged me $200 for the same. Next day she called and said, "I am sorry I made a mistake and you need to come again and amend the form and reduced my refund." It did not stop here and she called me again and finally made changed that reduced my refund one-third of the total that she first calculated. The worst is not yet over. It's been 7 weeks since this and I am still waiting on my refund. I called her office and she is not available. Another person was rude and simply told me to wait and said he cannot do anything. I would highly recommend to stay away from Jackson Hewitt.
Lexington Park MD they are to lazy to process our return: We went in and filed our taxes on March 4th. Now it's the 14th and Jackson Hewitt hasn't sent it in. The lady that did our taxes wasn't confident so she needed a manager to look at it, said it would be processed the next day. We have called and called they will not call us back. We paid them over 300$ for what?? To wait even longer to get our refund one month til April 15th. I shouldn't be worried about it getting filed on time. I did my job it's time they learned to do theirs. I'm absolutely fed up. I wouldn't recommend anyone go to Jackson Hewitt!
I called Jackson-Hewitt tax people in mountain home, AR 72653 and asked the cost of my tax prep. I was quoted $75.00 to 200.I made the appt and when we sat down I asked again after she looked over my tax paper. [They're very much the same as last year's]. I was quoted a price of $200. Last year I paid only 75.00 to another preparer. I told her no deal so then I was quoted a price of $100 which I agreed. After 3 hours of this alleged tax preparer going through my stuff, she informed me that I was getting $1,409 back from federal. I got $48 back last year so I questioned and she said last year I had a capital gain and this there was a loss. Any when this was completed, I found out the charge was $125. I went ahead and paid it just to get out of there. In looking it over and comparing to my last year's tax return, I found that she put me down for $40000 income [I had $50000 on the last return]. I took it to another local certified tax preparer and she said it was all wrong and I had it re-done by this one at the cost of another $100 dollars. The tax person at Jackson-Hewitt was totally incompetent and I am filing a complaint with the BBB.
I've used online tax services for many years for myself and two grandchildren. I've never had a problem or issue until using Jackson Hewitt. One problem after another and no intelligent resolution to the problems. No "live chat" so I keep getting standard replies to my NUMEROUS emails. STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY, FAR, FAR AWAY!
We went into a Walmart to have our taxes done. The lady done them and at the end of the session that is when she told us what are price was for doing the taxes. Later that week I received an e-mail to do a survey and I was asked if we were explained the prices before the taxes were done, NO we were not. I feel that we should get our money back.
I've used Jackson Hewitt for about 5 years. Their fees are high...but usually they are accurate. This year however they failed to file any of my healthcare marketplace forms. My tax return is in limbo. I had to take it upon myself to provide IRS with the needed forms as the JH office couldn't even fax these. I paid extra for this?
My son went to the Peachtree City GA location to have his taxes done. It was a 1040 EZ form stated the cost is 38.00. She finished in 5 minutes and charged him 375.00. Said if he wanted his money he had to pay this. This is a young man. First time doing it on his own. We always took to our accountant and never paid over 40.00. He was screwed over big time and so was his girlfriend. I have posted on social media and it will be a cold day before anyone in our family will ever use this company. Very Poor Of This Company To Take Advantage Of Our Young people. Thank goodness I'm a real estate professional and can get this rectified through one of my associates who is a tax attorney.
First they were deceptive about the $50 walmart gift card. You had to spend $200 on preparation to get this. Nowhere didn't say that. Then they messed up our bank info so our refund was lost. They did fix it but it took another week. Then my friend went and they told him he could get an advance but after all was done they then said that program had ended and he couldn't get it. No one at their main offices care. They are rude and unhelpful. Been waiting for return call since yesterday.
1st two people given the same appointment in the Seabrook Walmart store at 10 a.m. Had to leave because woman was there first and only one preparer and I could not come back. I made another appointment and had asked because I was doing my son’s taxes, what I needed and they said his W-2’s and any deductions that he may have. I asked if I needed a note, power of attorney or anything of that nature and the woman said no, just my driver’s license. I also asked if I could take the return and she said yes as long as I paid for it and he could mail it after signing it. Very simple and direct questions and answers, the answers were all wrong. I needed a driver’s license for my son and I could not take his return, he had to go and sign it after paying for it. The people giving information at the 800 numbers do not know what they are talking about and after talking to the preparers in each store they are frustrated.
They're just complete **. We only went there because someone told us they were cheap.. WRONG! When we first sat down I said how much is this going to cost. The guy working there said about $300 is our average.. WRONG. $650 ** dollars. Such **, we were in there for 2 hours then had to come back a week later because he needed more documents, he said and I quote "it won't take long". When we came back we were in there for 3 hours all in all 5 hours of my life wasted. Then the dumb a double s got our address wrong, he said he couldn't fix it. When he told me the price I about had a heart attack! Then on top of all that he acted like he was just the smartest guy around & my husband & I were idiots. He kept arguing with us about stupid ** like taxes next year, where we lived, what he said last time we were in there. Just complete crap. He may have meant well, & he may be a good guy but he's NOT good at his job. The whole company is crap, I should have known that when I chose to do my taxes at Walmart, lesson learned. Also I tried to track my return on their website. Again complete **. Apparently nothing matches my social so either that idiot messed up my social or that website is just complete ** like the rest of the company! Don't go there unless you want your whole entire tax return to go in their pockets. Never again!
Before I begin, let me say that I have spoken with a tax lawyer and they suggested communicating with as many people as possible to get together a class action lawsuit against this company. If you are interested in joining the cause, join our Facebook group at **. This is the first and last time that I will trust Jackson Hewitt with my taxes. We used their online filing service, which boasts, just like their offices, a one hundred percent accuracy guarantee. We were told that we would be getting a refund of just over one thousand dollars which was great because we are a family of three with one working person. After the return was accepted by the IRS, we went to Jackson Hewitt's website to check the status and the refund amount had gone down to just over two hundred dollars. We contacted the online chat because apparently those who file online aren't good enough to talk to a person on the phone unless they want to pay a fifty dollar fee. The person on the chat assured us that we were still getting the higher refund of a little over one thousand dollars and that what we were looking at was a computer glitch. Then the refund just disappeared for almost two weeks. We called the IRS to be told that a "mathematical error" had been made and the two hundred dollar refund was correct. Now, when I see the words One Hundred Percent Accuracy Guarantee, I take that to mean what it says but like any good consumer I did go to the fine print to make sure that they couldn't use some legal mumbo jumbo on me to say it didn't apply. The quote that supports my case is directly from their fine print and it states lower refunds are not covered IF "your tax refund was reduced or not received as a result of a tax lien, judgement, support order, unpaid student or government related loans, back taxes, or any other collection activity." NONE of those apply to my case. We contacted customer service and got the royal runaround. They didn't even pay attention to us until we started posting complaints on facebook. Finally we get to speak to a man named ** who claims that the guarantee doesn't apply to us, here's a fifty dollar Walmart gift card. Really? A discrepancy that's closer to nine hundred dollars and they offer a fifty dollar gift card? We have been trying for weeks to get to speak to someone above this man, and he keeps interfering and closing our cases. I emailed customer service only to be given the same man who refuses to help and fix the issue when I specifically asked for his supervisor. He gave me a phone number and said that if I wanted to talk to his boss, that was how to do it. The last communication I had from him was the 3rd of March. This last ticket I created on the 4th of March, demanding a call from his supervisor, using the phone number *he* gave me, and ** himself closed it out claiming that he called me on the 3rd of March. So not only does this company practice false advertising but they can apparently travel through time too. They do not take care of their customers. They don't care. They are frauds and scammers. Do NOT trust them. This loss is hurting my family in a big way and we really needed the money that we didn't get because Jackson Hewitt's software isn't accurate. I've reported them to everyone that I can, contacted them in any way that I can find, and I am still out almost nine hundred dollars because they are only in business because they ignore their customers and new customers are unaware of the scams and fraud. Spread the word about the practices and the FB group. If we can get enough people, we can make them pay attention to all of those they have hurt.
This was the third time I went to Jackson Hewitt for my Tax. This time was the WORST I've experienced with them or with any tax preparer I've been to. The good thing is he took time with my papers making sure there will be no mistakes. Thumbs up! At some time, I had to wait for 10-15 minutes while he was on the phone with someone trying to sent an email, smiling and giggling "Ooh you were spying on me?" After he hung up, he apologized stating it was an emergency. I didn't say anything. He also asked a few questions I feel he shouldn't ask me and has no business in what I do with my life. With all tax preparer I went to, he was the far most worst! Very rude and disrespectful. He looked at me so low, maybe because of my income, my race or perhaps how I speak? I don't know. And because of him, I will never go to Jackson Hewitt again as long as I live. This happen: Lunenburg, MA (Walmart).
I filed with Jackson Hewitt early February, was told my refund was rejected by the IRS because one of my dependents had been claimed by their father (whom has not been any part of their lives). I asked Jackson Hewitt what I should do. They KEPT advising me to take off that dependent and send in my return??! No!! Absolutely not, the child had been solely in my care! So I contacted the IRS, who told me NOT to take the child off and to file my taxes myself and send it in via mail by paper, and they would send me form 3949a to complete (fraud alert). I specifically told Jackson Hewitt NOT TO send in my return, filed myself, and completed the form. A couple weeks later I got an email stating my deposit was available by JACKSON HEWITT! Cost me 3 THOUSAND DOLLARS!!!! AND I'M NOW HAVING TO WAIT 16 WEEKS FOR MY FULL RETURN! DO NOT USE THEM, THEY TOOK OFF MY DEPENDENT SO THEY COULD GET PAID THE $501.00 SERVICE FEE!
I left H & R Block to go to Jackson Hewitt. I AM BEYOND DISAPPOINTED. They lied, they lost my check, and now told me there is NO ONE I can speak to in the UNITED STATES. They are in India. I could have done my taxes myself, but I paid for a service. I got NOTHING even close to service. Just VERY, VERY rude women... IT is MY money. WHY am I treated like this for MY money I worked hard for? I need to please speak to someone in the UNITED STATES REGARDING THIS MATTER ASAP. THANK YOU.
I had my taxes done at Jackson Hewitt tax service in one of the Wal-Mart stores. I usually go to H&R Block but I thought a 50 dollar gift card and the 500 dollar advance wouldn't be that bad to get. I paid close to 300 dollars to have it done. My tax preparer told me not to worry about anything - she knew what she was doing. I got my 50 gift card and my 500 advance. When it came to my federal income tax to be put on my Jackson Hewitt card - no problem. My state well that's another story. I called the number they gave me to talk to the tax people if there was a problem. 4 weeks later I found out they lost my state income tax but not from Jackson Hewitt. I called the state tax people to find out where my taxes were just to find out that they never received my state tax so I talked to the tax person who did my taxes yesterday and she told me that it was never sent along with 5 other customers. She did their taxes too and theirs were never sent and I've been getting the run around ever since. She wouldn't even let me talk to her boss which I was suppose to talk to yesterday also. What a joke.
We went to Wal-Mart to get our taxes done. We were told the we would received a $50.00 gift card. It never came. I call and email asking why. I was told there is no record that we would be getting a gift card. ON top of this, the person who did our taxes filled out a form that goes with the long time, which we didn't do. We were charge for the form, but it was not needed.
I have used TurboTax for 8 years now and it only cost $35. This year my PC broke so I went to Jackson Hewitt. I was never told of the prep fee in advance. And was offered a $500 advance which I never received because I did not register my card which again no one told to do this. My total prep fee was $558. That is just plain robbery in my book and unacceptable. These people prey on the poor who really need them. They charge you an outrageous prep fee of $558. I could have done this myself on TurboTax for $35. I'm not so sure what is so special about their software except it rips people off. Stay away from Jackson Hewitt. It is a scam.
I am shocked by the way I was rejected to do my taxes. I recently started a new business and because of his past experiences with multi level marketing he assumed that it was a scam. He started to bad mouth the company and my business, with no prior knowledge of what my company is about. He said that he did not believe we were making or could make any money without even looking at the proof we had on paper. When I attempted to ask him questions he rudely started talking over me and raising his voice. Then when we decided to leave, I was gathering my paper work and he forcefully ripped the cover sheet out of my hands giving me a serious paper cut and that contained all of my personal information, that I felt was no longer his business concern. I read many bad reviews about this company, but decided to give them a chance because they were so close to where I live, and I usually do my own taxes but this year since I started my own business I wanted to get professional help, but there was no sense of professionalism at all. Very disappointed. Do not go here if you have complex tax issues, only if you have simple tax concerns.
I wanted to give it less than 1, but that option wasn't available... I went to get my taxes at Jackson Hewitt. Before starting the process, I was told that charges would be around $100. I had some coupons, one of them was worth $25 and they told me that it will work in my case, so that brings down the charges to $75. Now, after the whole estimate was made, she asked me to pay 100$ and said that they can't use the coupon because computer is not letting them do it. I being a new person is US, didn't know at that time that could withdraw. So, I paid the whole amount by credit card. However, I kept telling her that it is very expensive as my taxes are very simple and friends got it done for $50-60. After 5 minutes, she tells me that you can cancel it if you want. The process wasn't yet complete, so I cancelled. I was told that I will get my refund in my mail. Next day, I called their office to find the status. I was told by them that they will charge me $25 for sending the refund. They were very rude, they were not listening to me and kept saying that those charges are because you wasted our time. They disconnected my phone, I called them repeatedly but they disconnected after listening to my voice which is highly unprofessional... I will never go to them again in future. I even complained at their main office and I was told that I will be contacted soon, but nobody called me back.
Went to 84 and Pecos branch - appointment set at 10:00 am, got there early at 9:45 waited till 10:45. 1 of the accounts was visiting with someone and did not know what the other one was doing, waited long enough, and left. Called the center to reschedule another appointment, set one up for Sunday @ 1:30 pm. Again got there early 12:45 pm. Waited till 2:00 - could not wait anymore??????? If you set a appointment make it happen. What a inconvenience. Going to H&R Block. Thanks.
I went in to Jackson Hewitt in Waterford MI. to file my taxes since my ex-wife and I filed there last year. This year I filed single, no dependents and they wanted to charge me for the previous year when we paid up front combining with this year's charges was almost 400$. When I declined for them to proceed with the transaction they charged me a 35$ cancellation fee. Is that even legal? I believe they are thieves just like they pocketed our money last year and charged it to our return.
I was told by them that I no longer had to pay taxes after 2013. Even though I had gotten a part time job I was assured no taxes would have to be paid. Both my wife and I are retired and drawing SS. Just for the heck of it my wife went to our county's Services For The Aged as they were doing taxes free. Guess what? I owe $603.00 because in my part time job I received a 1099 which allows me to only make $400.00. I know they won't do anything about it but you can bet your boots they'll see my wife or I again!!!
I went into one of their location in Wal-Mart. The lady who helped me was very rude, didn't ask any questions. Paid 185.00 to get treated like crap. She promised me the 50.00 promotion deal, said it will be emailed to me within 4 to 5 hours. I called the next day to see where it was at. The person told me I didn't qualified for it. Spent 3 days on the phone trying to figure out why is it OK for them to lie to customers. Finally a lady said she will give it to me because of the hassle I went through and to come back into their location to pick it up. She called me back the next day to tell me she can't give it to me until my taxes come in. I was like, "Fine, whatever." I check the IRS2Go app...it says my taxes were supposed to be on my card on the 25th. Here it is the 27th and still nothing. I got a hold of a person at Jackson Hewitt and they said, "You're going to have to wait until the money gets deposit into their bank and then deposit into mine." This company is ridiculous. Please, if you're thinking about getting your taxes done at Jackson Hewitt...please reconsider your choices.
I have been a J. H. client for over three years and this will be the last time I use them. The lady was acting like a complete Crack head not able to answer my questions! Rude, nasty, eating and talking in my face. I did not trust her to do it so I left and came back a week later to another rep who seemed extremely inexperienced. I never got my $50.00 incentive and I only got half of what they said. I have called many times and have yet to receive a call back regarding my money. I will never ever use their services again.
I had filed with Jackson Hewitt based on a friend’s knowledge of a free gift card with Walmart of $50.00. I usually file my own taxes but this year I had different schedules to add due to work and my folks are dependents. I gave them all my info and was told that the fee to file was $350. At this I was surprised since that seemed very high for a Single mother and in the past I filed for $25.00 with Tax Act. I was told my return would be $3631 and signed the correlating paperwork. I went home and tried to check with my own filing again through Tax Act and only came up with $2700 so naturally I decided to go with the higher return and pay the Fee. 10 Days later my return hits my account and it is $2000. I then went to the Walmart where I had gone previous at the set up kiosk.. They do not have any customer service lines available to talk to someone. The extensions they give out only go into the automated system that says all our tax advisers are busy. I complained about the difference in return amount and expressed my frustration and concerns. I was told by a different adviser that the person that I filed with is no longer under their employment and that she would have to contact her manager in order to find out what happened. There apparently was an error made and they failed to contact me on this. She said we have been very busy. Long story short they offered me a $100 Discount for filing next year’s taxes. I told her that I would not be filing with them next year and it was the Worst Filing experience I had ever encountered. I now believe that it is Schematic Set up So Beware!!!! I'm very disappointed. Single mother of two and will now proceed to the BBB.
Where is my money? Waiting after 20 days pending, I only used this company for the walmart gift card, I didn't even get. I will Never be using Jackson Hewitt again. Be warned they are not being straight forward.
The first time that I went and had my taxes filed, the man who did them did not put down my brother, although I gave him all the information. So he printed out my tax forms and sent me on my way. I went straight to my aunt because she is a certified tax preparer. My forms from Jackson Hewitt said I would get back a hundred and some dollars, and keep in mind I made close to $5,000 that year and have one dependent that is fifteen. My aunt called and talked to the person in charge and he re-did my taxes and I got back 2300.00 in federal. I still have the old forms that shows that I was only getting back a hundred and some. I'm very irritated because I paid $325.95 to you guys and you promise a fifty dollar Wal-Mart card and every time I call the person I need to talk to isn't there. This is **!!!!!!!! I can show you the 1st form that your tax professional filled out. He was very, very inexperienced, had no idea about tax laws when I asked.
I filed with JH January 30, 2015. I'm a first time customer with them so I only chose them because of the $500 and $50 promotion. I received the $550 within the next day, but now it's been over 25 business days and my other half of the refund is still processing!! I really hope JH didn't screw up my money. I desperately need to get a car so my son won't be out in the freezing cold. I was really counting on that money. I've been waiting patiently, I just hope I'll receive it soon. I'm going back to who I was using before. #BigMistake
Well I go to the same office for 9 years. Every year it's the same - great service. Except this year I go the the hammer lane office in Stockton CA. The attendant that helped me was Charmie **. I usually get my tax refund in 10 to 15 days so I expected the same thing this year. I filed on the third - it is now the 26. I was not informed of any changes. Why am I still waiting? So I call the office - all I get is "I don't know." It's your job to know. I am so displeased. I will not be going back next year. I will try H&R Block - maybe their service will be better next year.
I've been doing taxes with Jackson Hewitt for years, and never had a problem until this year 2015... This year we decided to have our money put onto a JH card, boy was that a mistake!!! The first day of our return we had over 7 thousand dollars on our card and decided to go out for dinner.. As we were trying to pay our bill the card could not be processed.. We were very upset, but thought maybe there was an issue because it was our first time using it. Well today our card won't work either. We are 3 hours away from home on business.. Can't reach a person to talk with, and are completely unable to use the card that has our money on it. On top of all this we were charged $300 more to file our taxes this year. Needless to say we will no longer be going to Jackson Hewitt.
Today I put my car in the shop, went to get my balance off my JH card - could not use the atm! The atm said I had a zero balance! So then I automatically called my card. I couldn't even get through - it kept saying "phone number is disconnected" or saying "technical difficulties"! So then I call the local JH tax store, they said the same story - keep checking your card! What a big inconvenience and I still gotta get my car out the shop in the am! I will not be returning to jh next year!!!!
I got my tax refund back on my prepaid JH preferred card and went to the auto store to buy some parts and my card was declined in front of a bunch of people. Embarrassing...pretty crazy since I have over 5 grand on the card, or so I thought. Go home, call the number, and the phones don't work. So I call Jackson Hewitt and am told that the debit cards aren't working and they don't know when they will be working. Still next day, no money, and they still don't know when the cards will be working. It's BS. I paid over 400 to have my taxes done and they can come up with a solution and get our money to us but they don't have any answers. I want a refund and my damn tax money NOW. Customer service at the preparer's office was very good. Jackson Hewitt just needs to get it ** together.
If you file your taxes with Jackson Hewitt don't let them load your money on the card. Because if you do when the system goes down you can't use your card.. It's very embarrassing to go purchase stuff and they tell you 'Sorry your card is declined'.. no email, no text, nothing to say sorry.
The Jackson Hewitt Preferred Card is the lousiest Prepaid Visa card I have ever used! It won’t work at any ATM's. I am unable to run the card as Debit. You have to run the card as credit! Then when I thought it couldn't get any worse I get my taxes loaded onto the card, and the first time I try to use it the card is declined. So I tried to call customer service to find out why and every time I called I got hung up on and couldn't even check my balance. So now what am I supposed to do? All my money is on that card! As soon as I have access to my card I will be withdrawing all of the money and closing the account! I will never recommend this card to anyone!
My complaints have nothing to do with tax prep errors, but rather absolute lack of accountability, accessibility and professional conduct one expects from an American based company. They clearly have no conscience when it comes to quality control from a management perspective. My first experience came in 2013, when I was misled into believing J.H. would contribute $30.00 to a children's non-profit, if I used their service. Only after I completed my return was I told, "We're not participating in that promotion.” The office fax machine didn't work. The computer broke down after three hours of data entry. Two days later I received a call that the materials I sent to IRS were all blank due to a printing machine error! After receiving word of an audit request, just reaching someone took weeks. The owner of the franchise lives nearly 2,000 miles away from his offices and had his calls forwarded to a relative's home where no one spoke English. I'm still waiting his call back and it's been three months! When I reached out to a different J.H. office to review my return, they informed me they were owned by a different franchisee and I'd have to pay a fee for them to review my return! I STRONGLY ADVISE AGAINST employing Jackson Hewitt to do your taxes. They're a disgrace.
I had a problem when trying to get funds off the card. I called the jackson hewitt that prepared my taxes. They weren't very knowledgeable about the card or what I could do to resolve the problem. I was just told to wait a few hours. Eventually, I figured out what the problem was on my own. The customer service line for the jh preferred card always clicked me off or didn't answer at all. I never was able to speak to a customer service representative. I've been doing my own taxes for the past few years, but gave jh a try because of work and schooling. Never again!!!
They had to refile my taxes twice and never received credit of my fees. 381.00 in fees. Very unhappy, never use them again. They never made good on what they did wrong.
Here is why Jackson Hewett is the worst. Tax preparer NEVER Show up at work to so I could file my Taxes, drove 18 mile round trip in the snow for nothing. Call highland park call center told she on her way, call again 1 hour later told the same, call for a third time same lady told me to ** and quit calling. Called call center 4 time to file a complaint told to call corporate. Call corporate left on hold 15 minutes.
I walked into the office on Okeechobee rd in fort pierce Florida with my fiancé and was asking some questions then finally the tax preparer said “come back just you” to my fiancé. I asked what the issue was that I could not come back. The lady in the front proceeded to point her finger in my face and say "y’all ain’t married". When I told her she didn't know my status and that we were in fact filing together, she proceeded to argue and told us we couldn't even file together even though he is the provider and was going to claim me as well as our 2 children. I then went to h and r block and had no problems - they were professional and we had no problems filing. I have always went to Jackson Hewitt as well as my entire family but I will no longer ever go there and neither will anyone I talk to. This was by far the worst experience I have had in my life. They are so unprofessional and rude - it was disgusting. Something needs to be done there.
Went to have my taxes done and my refund was four thousand less than last year with similar income etc. The worker said he charged me about $500. Turns out the JH tax worker left out my earned income by mistake. After I found the error he offer to correct it. I said "No way are you doing my taxes" and he said I would have to leave all my information with him but I took my info and he chased me to the door where I escaped. I went to a local family owned place and they did my taxes for $100 and I got more than what I got last year and was treated with respect. NEVER go to a national chain for tax matters - they often do not even have college degrees in business.
Everyone told us do not go to Jackson Hewitt. We should have listened! Not only do we not get EIC but after we signed our tax papers she then informed us that we will be paying 315 dollars for their services! Why you told us it would only be 158. Then she said we would get the 50 dollar gift card right away. She lied. She then informed me that we wouldn't get it till 48 hours later! I am canceling our refund tomorrow morning! She lied bout how much it would cost after we signed everything then she told us a different amount! We're not being ripped off! She will cancel our refund or I will make sure she loses her job! You should never lie to someone especially coming tax time. I can do my own taxes for free! And that's what will happen! Worst experience ever! If you have to do taxes go to liberty or turbo! H and R are a rip off too!
I went to have my taxes done on Feb 3-15. My tax preparer had no knowledge about tax preparation. Long story short, every line, she had to call the main office. Finally got some relief from another untrained preparer, then a supervisor happened to show up. I had a basic tax that should have taken 1 hour. I was there for four hours. Supervisor said he would reduce my fee to $179. Still a little high for waiting 4 hours. He also said he would honor my $50 coupon that I presented. Now they refuse to give it to me, saying they already gave me a discount. I have spoken to everyone there and they absolutely refuse to honor the coupon. I could have had this done for way less than $179 to begin with. Then I had to endure all this time and aggravation. I am so frustrated and feel so abused by these people. How can they ignore a coupon that they sent me in the mail as a come on? What can I do? I would truly appreciate your follow-up.
Where do I start. I made A appointment after 3 days of attempting to call them. I thought ok should be a simple process that took 2 hours 1 w2 and 3 dependents to claim. Lady was very nice, talked the whole time she was doing my paperwork. She told me my fees would be around 300.00, ok that's a lot but I needed to file. 299.00 to file federal and 38.00 to file state and 8.00 paper filing fee. Ask if I wanted to apply for the 200.00 loan. Sure why not, after all she said it was free. I asked if it was cheaper to pay fees upfront, I was told no! Little did I know I was charged 64.00 for fees to have it coming out of my return. I was under the impression my refund was coming on my JH preferred debit card. Well after a few weeks of me waiting I knew something was wrong. After several days of calling I was told I would get a paper check. I called several times for them to find out how my return was coming to me. I filed on Jan 30th-- it took the whole 21 days. So I get a call saying I had a check, went to pick it up and no one was there-- gone for the day due to sickness. Ok well what about my state? It was mailed to my house, I wasn't aware I had to pay 17.00 for them to print the 2 checks-- one they didn't print, the state printed it. WHEN YOU SIGN THAT LITTLE PAD YOU CAN'T SEE WHAT YOU ARE SIGNING. All that I have stated above the whole 21 signatures is what you are signing in the end. 21 days later and 404.00 later I still can't pick up my federal refund because no one's in the office. I want some of my fees back especially the ones I didn't know about!! Never again.
Just to let you all know I'm a bit aggravated with JH myself but I will explain how the $50 card works for anyone interested. It comes in your email about an hour after you file. Only if you pay over a certain amount to file. If you don't get the email stop by their office & they can print it for you & the cashier just scans barcode on printout :)
Preparer did not give all of the information needed. Documents were not available online until the 48 hour period had expired.... Ironically. Didn't get what I was there for. Could have filed my own if I wanted to wait. Very disappointed.
I felt that there was a monkey sitting behind a computer entering my tax information. He could answer any question at all and if it wasn't for his crack ** co-worker I would still be sitting there waiting for it to get it done. I normal file my tax online but this year I thought I would try a tax prepared to file my tax to try to get a bigger refund but that was a mistake. I called their customer service and complained but they don't care. It would of been better talking to a wall.
Jackson Hewitt just charged our 21 year old son $389 to do a 1040EZ!!!! Apparently he got charged more because he had 2 W-2's... WHAT??!! Lesson learned for him I guess. If he would've done it himself he would be getting $809 back instead of $420. And I already called and asked them to explain their fees and they said it's what their corporate office sent down as the mandatory fees... $280 to file 2 federal forms because he had two W-2's, $30 to file the state tax form, $10 data and document storage (really??), and a $25 Gold guarantee (What is that??!!). Then to add insult to injury they charged him another $69.95 in assisted refund fees... Really??!! So here I sit thinking $280 wasn't enough in fees to file the paperwork - you're just going to throw in another $69.95 just to kick him while you have him down?! Really?! Come On!! On top of everything he didn't get the $50 Wal-Mart "BATE" Gift Card because he didn't pay at least $500 in Fees. Worst tax experience I've EVER encountered. I WOULD SUGGEST NOBODY EVER GO THERE!!!!
I was promised the 50-dollar Walmart card. Did not get it. Gave them 160 for taxes, then they came up and said there was a 12-dollar storage fee so I didn't get the card. What a ripoff. I would not go there again. Nowhere does it say in the ad about 12 for storage fee.
I attended the Jackson-Hewitt office at 5050 Troup Hwy in Tyler,TX, done by **, inside the Walmart. I have little experience with taxes, and wanted to begin filing independently. I also wanted to consult with a human rather than file taxes on some software. I was charged $288, which was 1/2 of my EIC. Needless to say, my EIC was pretty much taken away. I also didn't get a copy of my 1040 with my other paperwork... I didn't know that, apparently, the rule is to not print them immediately... huh? I had to call JH about this and go through the trouble just to make a second trip back to his office... when this should've been done all at once. I couldn't reach him directly by phone, neither; the extension listed on the business card is absolutely useless. I had no idea that I really shouldn't have been charged $288 until I told my mom; she went INSANE. I only had a 1040 form done and brought in a W2, that's it! She was never charged nearly that much, and her tax situation is far more complicated than mine. I am single, no kids, and a student! So, LESSON LEARNED y'all. It sucks being in my 20s (I am 25) sometimes because that is where I have been ripped off the most and lost so much money, due to the fact that I am inexperienced. Jackson-Hewitt has taken advantage of that. Why aren't these tax places consistent with everyone?! I don't understand that, unless the bottom line is to earn some extra money illegally. Being possibly independently owned, as I am reading the business card now, also raises a red flag (should that raise a red flag, by chance?). I'm the inexperienced one here, not much of a clue of what's going on until I share my experience. Matter of fact, is it even possible to get some of my money back?! I trusted Jackson-Hewitt, and apparently I have been ripped off entirely. I hope that they enjoy my money, because I am never going back!
Took everything to Jackson Hewitt for taxes to be filed and after presenting all nessesary forms the tax preparer entered wrong info and went back to tell them and they said wait and make corrections next year when I paid 554.95 for guarantee accuracy. Tried to contact manager or home office but after 2 employees and a manager I got no satisfaction. I will never use or recommend them to anyone. If you can't do it right at least fix it now not next year.
My Wife and I have been having our taxes prepared by Jackson Hewitt for years now, without incident and without anything ever being questioned. Even with the fees that we believed to be astronomical, we still agreed to pay these fees in exchange for our taxes being prepared by a professional service that was backed by guarantees. After a few years of dealing with Jackson Hewitt, the person began to suggest that we "no longer needed to pay for the insurance as we've never had a problem". We agreed STUPID, STUPID CHOICE on our part! 2 years later, what do you know, an IRS Audit - and even though we did nothing wrong, illegal, or otherwise immoral - the IRS jerked us around and said we owe $3,800 from that years return (including fines and penalties). We returned to Jackson Hewitt, whom we paid nearly $500 to prepare that return to seek out assistance. We got basically NOTHING!! After years of dealing with these people and feeling like we had just a little more than a "hello file my taxes" relationship - my Wife and I were reminded of the cruel reality of certain business practices. We are strictly a customer - and anything else after that is our fault. It is true, we ignorantly agreed to discontinue with the extra insurance coverage - but only under the guidance and suggestion by the Jackson Hewitt Staff that we do so. Then when the issue arose with the taxes that they prepared and that they agree that we did nothing wrong, illegal, or immoral... they left us out to dry and to fend for ourselves. My Wife and I couldn't even begin to make a suggestion as to what we wanted from them in the manner of assistance. Maybe pay it, since you suggested that we discontinue with the insurance coverage. Maybe pay a portion of it? Whatever the case may be, we expected more than them providing us with a list of phone numbers to contact for assistance, because that's what we received. Phone numbers!! So, the bottom line is: We are paying the IRS $3,800 - just because they can take it from us. Honestly, no valid reason at all, just a bunch of paper requests and excuses on the part of the IRS. Each time we provide them with the documents they request, they request something that's a little more difficult to obtain. You work like animals all year long to do things right and provide for your family and they do things like this to people who not only cannot afford t give away this kind of money - but rely on tax returns for one reason or another. This is ridiculous. Remember - you are only a client to these people. ALWAYS REQUEST THE INSURANCE COVERAGE and don't allow them to tell you anything different. It will be money well spent.
While working through Schedule E which is for rental home, there is a section related to depreciation. It's easy to answer the question and the result is accurate. But here is where the problem begins, the result is posted to a Schedule C (business expenses). The result should stay on the Schedule E line 18 as an expense. I contacted Jackson Hewitt via e-mail, about 8 times asking for help, each agent was nice, but not helpful. They are not making the connection that I do fill out the blanks correctly and their programming sends results to the wrong form.
First I'd like to address the site. "What were the consequences?" Uhm, dealing with your service in which my 3 month old daughter could complete in a more timely and accomplished matter. Okay, now to the "what happened." I got my taxes filed last Tuesday at the Jackson Hewitt office in the Elizabethtown Walmart. (100 Walmart Dr. Elizabethtown, KY) The associate's name whom I will not say was polite but very misleading on a lot of things. I've filed with this company 2 years in a row before and never had an issue and always felt satisfied. This year on the other hand... it felt like they took my face, put it under their butt, and ** all over me. I brought 1 W2 in, I made enough to get the $50 Walmart gift card. The associate said I'd get it in the mail. (Never came, called, they never sent in for it.) Anyway, back to being raped by lies... The person told me my return would be decent. It was $813 at first which had me semi excited since my fiance claimed our daughter and got back $5,100. But that excitement was short lived as the end of the "service" came near. At first she said the charge would be $100 even. Guess what? Before being asked to sign the electronic signature, that number bumped up to $275. I said "well that doesn't make any sense." So she tried to mess with it and it went down. By 5 ** dollars. So to leave before getting angry I signed and got the card. Welp, as these lying scumbag's luck would ** me over, the information the associate put on the card was wrong and now I'll have to wait. I am never going back to them. 1/10. Funny how we work hard all year and struggle year round just to spend more during the holiday season to brighten our children's worlds up just to either owe money or get shorted on money for taxes that prison inmates live off of for years. I thought we left England to get away from taxing the poor, not to be in the biggest scam of the 2000's.
Overcharged double to have my taxes done. Taxes were not done accurately, the representative mistyped in my birthday when driver's license was on desk for the duration of the appointment. Did not explain why taxes were double compared to quote over the phone. Owner disputed the $50 gift card because taxes should have been an extra $100 when in reality I paid an extra $100 over what I should have paid. Owner called and completely disputed what the tax preparer said I should have paid when I asked her about the overcharge and to have an amendment made to the taxes.
The woman doing my taxes put my account info in wrong now they're telling me they don't know where my tax check is. Next year I will be using Turbo tax that's for sure. Tried to call their home office got a call center instead. The woman on the phone spoke so little English she couldn't even help what so ever. It's been two weeks of getting the run around from these incompetent fools. I will be calling the BBB Monday and filing a complaint with the IRS.
I went to Jackson Hewitt to get my taxes done mostly because I was told I could get a $200.00 refund advance which I did in fact get... I also got a $50.00 Wal-Mart eGift card just for doing my taxes in Wal-Mart. This was pretty cool. But then I was charged $428.00 just to get my taxes done. OK fine I hated the price but I agreed... my fiance was not at all happy with how much I agreed to pay. I waited like everyone else knowing that is was going to take a while to get my refund back. Not a problem there. But then I found out that the IRS sent my taxes to the bank yesterday 2/12/15, even Jackson Hewitt's website showed that it was deposited... However I call my bank and no pending deposits... hmmm that upset me a little because how could both the IRS and JH be wrong. I called JH and yes it was deposited into THEIR account (not mine) and it would take JH an additional 2 business days for me to get MY money. JH is making sure they get theirs (naturally) but why do I have to wait even longer to get mine. This in my opinion is very wrong and I will not ever use JH again nor recommend them to anyone. I will from this moment forward use either TurboTax or the IRS website (which is free) and I will get MY money the moment it is sent into my bank account. True there will be no $50.00 gift card (which did come in handy) or a $200.00 advance (which did come in handy) I am grateful for both of those things... but are they really necessary? I do not think believe so. I will not ever use JH again.... (JACKSON HEWITT)
Jackson Hewitt should change their name to Jacked Me!! Filed on 1/23/2015, using direct deposit to my bank account, and have not received nothing of a refund YET! Only answer I get from JH is "It's the IRS" and "You just have to wait!" I find this to be a bunch of Bull!! Others that I know with other companies have received refunds back and filed way after me! Lesson learned and never again!!!
They not only charged me 301 to file (and that was with the $91 discount) but the amount was completely off. I've never been so misinformed and over paid. It's only $12 to file state and federal is free!! Why did I pay so dang much and the amounts I was told was off by anywhere from $40 to almost $100!!! Ridiculous!!!!
I went in for my 1st time to this company. The guy seemed really nice and knowledgeable. The advertisements were $20 and some change for basic return and $40 and some change for the deluxe. Little DID I know my tax return would be about $450...not including the $40 charge for direct deposit!! But the guy never discussed payment options and how much (estimated would have been wonderful) it would have cost me until the very end when I had to sign for it. That's when I asked how much it would have been. He wouldn't even tell me how much I was getting back until after I was hesitant on signing, it took over 4x of asking him how much I was getting back. When I was about to recant, he started telling me that he put in a lot of hard work into doing my taxes, just so he could make me feel guilty and pay the $450. Wtf?! I have never paid over $180 for my taxes done...and that was through a private agency. Looks like I will be going back! Ohh and that $50 dollar gift card for Wal-Mart?? Never got it like he said!! Total rip off!!!! And it's been almost a whole week since I DID my return and I am unable to track it online nor through the 1800 number they give you! Beware!!!!
Called and made an 11:30 am appointment with the ridiculously rude woman on the customer service line. Showed up on time to a bare and empty building with one woman at a desk helping a man, and an elderly couple in the waiting room. We informed the woman we have an appointment and she replied, "Well I'm the only one here so appointments don't matter here. I need to finish with him and then they are ahead of you. Fill out that form and have a seat." WTF?! Appointments don't matter?! My husband called the customer service number and told them what happened. No ducks were given by JH. Back to H&R block as usual. I don't know why we even tried anywhere else. Screw you JH!!
Omg I have been at Wal-Mart for 2 hours now. When I got here and checked in there was one person in front of me and one person getting taxes done. I asked if I need to make an appointment and the lady said no we just wait on who got here first... After an hour there was now five people waiting.. The same man was getting taxes done... There was now a 1230 appointment and a 1:00 appointment that came to check in... So although I had been waiting an hour they are now ahead of me... Which they should be because they made an appointment like I asked about when I got here... The man in front of me got mad and left followed but two people behind me... All going to H&R... I am still here at Jackson Hewitt now third in line... Why stay you wonder??? Because I'm a curious person that finds this dysfunctional system amusing... I wonder how many people in the time that I sit here playing on Facebook will Jackson Hewitt let fly out the door losing 100s of dollars in hours.. Why I wonder... Maybe because of only having one person working??? The dysfunctional ways to set an appointment??? I know the top people that will be losing all these 1,000,000 of dollars a year and customers for the following years. Would that note and fix these prob? A $50 gift card is not going to make people wait 2 or more hours for taxes... At Branson Mo supper center 2:23 min and counting... Lol
File with Jackson ass a few weeks back. IRS sent my refund through 3 days later, I never got anything in my bank. So I went through the papers that rep gave me just to find out that she enters the wrong account number. I call them to find out where my money is, she's said they got my refund there cause my account number was wrong. They make is sound like you made a mistake not them. A phone call would be nice from those ** but nobody called. Worst place ever. They hire the stupidest people to work there.
Well the IRS sent my refund on the 9th. It's the third business day and still nothing on the preferred card. This is ridiculous... I have called around to different offices and their main line and nobody can give me much information. Instead I got a very rude customer service representative from the Xenia Ohio office. I will never ever use Jackson Hewitt again. They have poor quality and standards.
Your rep lost one of my W2s and had to do an amendment. I got advance on prepaid JH Visa card and was humiliated when it declined it at Wal-Mart with a full basket of stuff, after I had already spent 60 off it. Took me 2 days and 4 hours of being on hold to get fixed. Not to mention I was charged 400 dollars to prep them. I'm 50 and have never paid that much. This was worst experience ever. Actually thinking of getting second opinion.
I had my taxes done with Hewitt for the past three years. I had a standard federal and two states done, they never told me a fee until after they finished. Fees for the past two years were just under three hundred dollars and now that I have two more dependents this year they charged me over $400 dollars. This is outrageous and I will never have Hewitt do my taxes again.. they told me that was a going rate. I told him **. Stay away and save your money, do your research.
I had my 2014 tax prepaired in Granbury Texas at Wal-Mart by a George **. This was not the first time I used Jackson Hewitt, but you can be assured it'll be the last time!! According to your home page and the "INSTANT $50 GIFT CARD, OUR WAY OF SAYING WE APPRECIATE YOUR BUSINESS"!! Nowhere did I see a disclaimer stating that the $50 gift card is only for those that are expecting a refund!! We were informed that since we owe the IRS, we weren't entitled to the card and not by George but after several attempts to get in touch with your call centers. When your representative finished and completed our tax forms, he should have at that time informed us that since we owe and wouldn't be receiving a refund that we wouldn't be eligible to receive a card!! But, he didn't instead he told us that we would be getting a voucher via my e-mail, in fact he asked me to confirm that the e-mail that was recorded was correct. I realize that $50 isn't a lot, it's the principle that Jackson Hewitt is falsely misleading people to believe that by using your service that the incentive of getting something in return you will obtain more business. If you continue to advertise that a $50 card is awaiting you, I hope you have the common decency to at least put a disclaimer at the bottom of your advertisements "No card will be given if a balance is due to the IRS". I can promise you, that never again will I use Jackson Hewitt and I'll be sure to tell anyone who wishes to listen how Jackson Hewitt misleads their potential customers. I may even contact Wal-Mart complaint department and advise them of their allowing floor space within their stores that intentionally and knowingly are misleading their own Wal-Mart customers who may use Jackson Hewitt's tax service.
Well me and my husband went to Jackson Hewitt in Bremen, GA at the Wal-Mart. We got a tax lady by the name of Danielle. She was the worst tax person ever! My husband told her his miles - he goes to work everyday 'cause we was writing our mileage off. Well all this woman said was "man that's a lot of miles" - she never wrote it down. Then she messed up on some of the paper work. Then we asked her how much we was getting back, she could not even tell us! I will NEVER go to Jackson Hewitt again. My sisters who filed their taxes a week after me has their taxes back already. I'm still waiting on mine, it's going on 3 weeks. Going to Jackson Hewitt was my worst mistake ever.
My first time filing and I feel like the biggest dummy by going through w/ Jackson Hewitt here in Beloit, WI! Tax agent said I would have to pay for 2 refunds to file my year '13 W-2s and I didn't qualify for the $200 offer (I have got confirmations from the 800 # that I was suppose to have walked out with). My refund was rejected (I know they had the right email address because they had no problem sending me 3 surveys about experience) & I had no way of knowing 'til I called them...not the store of course since the store never answer the phones or return voice mails. The WORST EXPERIENCE EVER! If my return get rejected again I will be going to H&R Block - I hear they don't hire dementia patients to play as tax agents.
I just had my taxes prepared at the Wall Mart, Jackson Hewitt in Crosby Texas. It was the worst experience ever. It took over 2 hours to complete the simple fill in the blank form. The lady that they had on duty obviously was hired for the season and had no experience whatsoever. I had to answer most of the questions on the form for her. She had to make about 5 phone calls to ask for help and even told me she had never seen or done a form 1098T. After all was said and done they charged me $405.00.
Went to the booth at Wal-Mart to have my taxes done. After finding out that my $18,500 in Child Support is not claimable, I found out I owed over a thousand bucks to the Feds. All said and done, I paid the service 300 bucks. I asked about the 50 dollar card from Wal-Mart, and was told I would get an e-mail with it shortly. I waited a week to give them time, but no e-mail arrived. I called the number and was told that the agent should have put that in as part of my return. So I asked if I just got screwed out of fifty bucks, and the girl said YES! I will check with them again today to try to fix this, but their customer support rating just took a big hit from me, and I will never use their services again.
2011, 2012, 2013, 2014 received audit notice. Audit for years 2012, 2013. Contacted JH. They prepared our taxes all 3 years, and several years before. We ALWAYS bought the GOLD ACCURACY INSURANCE. That said here's our story. My husband is a truck driver. My health insurance through my employer is PRETAXED. The letters in the box on my W2 showed that. I withdrew 16,000.00 from my 401k. I had the form sent to me by employer with me. Along with ALL W2 forms, all receipts (neatly organized) labeled and ready. Here is why we were audited. The preparer left one year's W2 completely off for my husband. Different preparer following year not only didn't add the 401k withdrawal, but also added my health insurance with our medical deductions!! Our med deduction was what flagged it. Seems it was that way for two years. Added in depreciation on husband's semi that should not have been. No longer had truck and all issues with it were closed previously. When I picked up our 2012 taxes- SOMEONE ELSES TAX RETURN WAS IN IT INSTEAD OF OURS!! We contacted JH. I took all info, receipts, statements, truck info, and logs to them the date they said to bring them. The audit date was two days away. JH called our AUDITOR and postponed the exam because JH was not ready. Auditor was VERY nice. Said ok. Gave us a new date 1 MONTH away. Didn't hear back from JH until day before appointment. Needed info- THAT HE ALREADY HAD WITH OUR OTHER INFO! Big day arrives. JH shows up with 4 boxes of disorganized receipts and info. All of which I had taken in TWO boxes. Mine and husbands. AND a newly prepared amended tax return for 2012, 2013. Our Auditor listened to JH apologize and "TAKE FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE COMPANY MAKING THE MISTAKES". Auditor flipped through it. Looked at W2s and shook his head. Flipped through the 2011 just because it was there. Said it was "Horrible, but because he had not requested it, and, it was to our favor, and, the fact the other ones were going to be so expensive, he wasn't going to examine it". Threw it on the chair and told JH "When these folks leave, you and I are going to have a discussion about your preparers!" When he started looking at the years he did want, he just shook his head. He told JH the AMENDED return was worse than the original. Asked who did the figures. The bigwig REPRESENTATIVE with us did it. His excuse was, "WELL, I DIDN'T GET IT UNTIL LAST WEEK". WRONG!!!! I personally gave it to him one month and one week before our appt!!! Oh, and last but NOT LEAST- THE PREPARER FOR THE YEAR 2013 DID NOT add the GOLD PLAN INSURANCE like we had asked her to. So JH got off easy. They paid a total of $ 5000.00 toward 2012. $00 for year 2013. And a little over $2,300.00 in penalties and fees for 2012 and 2013 together. Leaving us with a balance of over $6,000.00!! When I asked why not all JH, said bc no Gold plan. To read about it on website. So basically know 2 things. JH KNOWS THEY ARE GOING TO MESS UP BIG TIME, OR THEY WOULDN'T HAVE THE GOLD PLAN TO COVER THEMSELVES WITH A LIMIT OF $5,000.00 and they only cover penalties and fees automatically. Ok, and one more .. I will never recommend JH. We DREAD the carryover for 2014. Also got w2 FROM JH on penalties and fees they reimbursed to us along with the other $5,000.00. Really?? This was NOT income!!
They did my taxes and gave me a card that is no good. And they still made me 500.00 for doing my taxes and i still have no money. So all my money is nowhere and they just don't care. I will never use them again in my life.
I went with my daughter to go to Jackson Hewitt on clinton hwy in powell tn and when my daughter asked how much the fees would be the tax lady stated, "I can't see the paperwork right now." And when asked again the tax lady gave her the run around. My daughter had a 1040 with 1 dependent and 2 w-2's is all. When my daughter saw the fees of $412 she confronted them. They set a date to come in the next day to speak with her. They were a no show, so they told her to come in on monday morning. She was told she was getting a deal because she already got a $115 discount. DO THEY THINK WE ARE STUPID!!! Oh, and plus she got the $50 card. OMG. I had to leave the building because I was in a freak out mode.. I have never seen anything like this! I will also contact our state representative and RipOff.com. They lost my business forever…
After my tax work was completed, I asked for my gift card and was told that I didn't qualify because I wasn't getting 1000 dollars or more back. The advertisement says 50 dollar Wal-Mart gift card.. 'INSTANTLY' when we do your taxes. (That's cut and dry.)
I can't think of any word worse than horrendous or I would use it. Make no mistake never ever ever ever will I go there again.
I normally go to H&R Block to do my taxes, they have never charged me more than $60 to file. This year, I got a promotional offer in the mail offering me a free $50 Walmart gift card for filing with Jackson Hewitt. After reading the fine print and terms & conditions on jacksonhewitt.com, I was fooled into believing it was a legitimate offer. When I sat down with the Jackson Hewitt tax professional, I explained that the $50 gift card was the reason why I chose their company, however the tax pro failed to explain any stipulations with that promotional offer. It wasn't until after I paid $149 to file that I was informed that I did not qualify for the gift card because there is a $150 minimum prep fee required to receive the gift card (I was $1 short). This $150 minimum fee was not specified in the fine print or terms & conditions, so I felt they had tricked me into filing with them. I felt deceived and cheated. I was extremely unsatisfied with Jackson Hewitt and will never file with them again. H&R Block is a whole lot cheaper and much more trustworthy than this company.
Only reason we used Jackson Hewitt was we were told filing fee was $49.00 and we would get a $50.00 Walmart gift card. The fees ended up being $469.00 and after a week of trying to get the gift card (and $50.00) in gas burned up. Running back and forth to Jackson Hewitt we are told the first agent to work on our taxes forgot to request the gift card.....So sorry. Now it can't be done!!! I would NOT refer this company to ANYONE!!!
I have been going to jackson hewitt in the walmart on mound in sterling heights for over 3 years. And I am not happy. Not only did they mess up last year and not do my return to be direct deposit but by check in the mail. This year I go to my appointment and of course they're helping someone else. I waited for 30 min and still nothing. The guy ignore me. I call the main office and there's nothing they can do really. So I give them another chance and schedule another app with my husband also. And we go and the same thing but this time we waited over 40 min and I told the guy I had an app at 2. And he said he thought it was at 3 and if he can re schedule it. I said no. I'm fed up, this is the 3rd see up and 2nd time this happen so I'm taking my business elsewhere. Thank you for being a poor company.
I went to JH to get my taxes done professionally. Well at first everything was great got us back more than what was expected. Few months later we get a letter from IRS saying we owe $3400.00. The rep put wrong information in. Confronted them and they said up front he put the wrong information in and nothing can be done and I now have a bill. Don't go to these people they are not hardly experienced and obviously can't read from one paper to another. Thanks a lot JH.
Went in there to do my taxes. Lady asked if I have ever been convicted of a felony, when I answered - because of the mistakes I made a long long time ago - yes she laughed at me and when I asked for my stuff back so I can go somewhere else, she told me she was still going to bill me. Completely disrespectful place, will never go there again.
I have worked in every kind of customer service possible; retail, food, and now a receptionist, so before I start in on this, let me make it clear that I know what it is like to deal with irrational and mean people, and I know what it is like when you have a bad day and want to put in minimum effort. Starting out, I went to the Brighton, Co Walmart off of Bromley. I worked with a really nice guy the whole time, at the end the refund came out to less than I was expecting since my grandma and I had done my taxes last night and it came out to a significantly larger amount. The nice guy said "Okay! No problem! Let's review." Then a few minutes in, a different guy, Russian, that I won't publicly name, came around the corner. My preparer asked him a question and instead of just answering and letting my guy finish the job, he told him to move. My guy moved and down sat the really mean Russian guy. He started going through and kept repeating the same line "Your grants and scholarships are far more than the cost of school was, so you don't get very much back." I understood this, and told him I did, but he kept repeating it, getting angrier and angrier each time. I looked at him and said "I am not stupid." He laughed at me. I didn't even know what to say to that, so I said nothing. I tried to explain to him that my grandma and I had done them last night without submitting them and that the refund was much more. I can understand if it would be a little less or somewhere in the middle, but it was far less. He interrupted me numerous times before I could finish that sentence, but once he allowed me to finish he told me in response that "It wasn't his fault my grandma and I don't know what we're doing." Once again, taken back about his rudeness, I kept quiet. He then got to my schooling part and noticed that I work full time as well as go to school full time. He accused me of lying about doing both saying that it wasn't possible for me to do both full time. I work extremely hard to do both full time and it was a below the belt shot to tell me I was a liar. When I stood my ground and told him it was not a lie, he said "Okay, but you can get in trouble with the IRS for lying about anything." He went on to say that I had no kids, no house, and wasn't paying for school out of pocket so my refund wouldn't be very much. I then said "So let me get this straight, I am only 19 years and do not have any children, no house, and I do well enough in school to be fortunate enough to not have to pay for it, and I don't get barely anything back." He then said "That is the American way." He then asked me if I understood, I was not going to fight with him in front of the whole store and I was not going to argue with someone I knew wouldn't listen, so I said "Sure, whatever." He then smiled and said "Finally, I am glad you understand." He then let the other guy sit down and close the deal. The other guy apologized to me for having to deal with the guy. Then as we were finishing up, the Russian guy was talking to another associate about me directly in front of me. I will NEVER recommend anyone to this tax service, nor will I return. Even if my refund was 100% correct or not, I did not deserve that kind of treatment. What a customer gets from any business means nothing, no matter how accurate, if they are treated that terribly. Oh, and let me add that I called about this last Saturday and was told I would receive a phone call in 48 hours explaining how the situation was taken care of, I have not heard back and it is now a week later. I also filled out an online survey and have not heard anything back. I called again and they wanted to completely repeat everything I had already said twice, which I was not going to do. So not only was my experience the worst and most demeaning I have ever had, but it has not been taken care of.
We had our taxes done at Jackson Hewitt and we have done for a few years now. The lady that did our taxes talked us into getting this card. The JH card as I'm sure you are familiar with.. what a nightmare. We were told that we could go to the money center in Wal-Mart and take all OUR money off the card and ask would be fine... HA. After pulling some money off of this so-called wonderful card, it refused to let me have the rest of MY MONEY!!!!! And yesterday the same lady who talked us into this nightmare rings us that we were only allowed to pull 2,500 a month and you Jackson Hewitt signed the contract to do this to people. Now it's going to take me 2 months to be able to access all MY MONEY because of one contract. This is not fair and you know this is wrong to do to people. When I asked the lady to get me a paper check she was very hateful and told me no, they couldn't do that. But it's awful funny that the lady told us if we had any problems with this card to come back and she would make sure we was issued a paper check. She was hateful when she was tallying up what we was to pay Jackson Hewitt. Well I think you guys need to make this right. You know people was going to be upset when they was unable to access their money at tax time which they look forward to every year. I will not be using Jackson Hewitt again...
I made an appointment to file my taxes. My husband could not come so we figured he could just come in the next day to sign. So I sit down for but a few seconds when he says it will probably take him a bit to complete the paperwork. Okay. I'm fine if he finishes it so we can just come in and sign. Cool. Come in the next day. Wait about an hour and a half. I just ask the lady who was working with a couple for about an hour to see if our paper work was ready to sign. Nope. He didn't even start it. Don't waste your time.
NO WAY TO RATE THEM WITH NO STARS??? MAN TOO BAD I HAD TO PUT ONE. I wish everyone would review comments and reviews before they go to Jackson Hewitt. I should of done the same, but I thought since they were a big known tax co that they were good. I went to get my taxes done on my scheduled appointment at a Wal-Mart location. There was only one tax preparer. My original appointment was at 6 p.m. The guy had one customer there doing his taxes, so he told me it would take at least one more hour, that if I wanted to wait or come back the following day at 5:00 p.m., so I told them I was going to do a little grocery shopping then I would come back, After the hour I stand next to the stand curtain that they have and once he saw me he gets up and tells me, "You know what, i'm gonna have to reschedule you for another day, because I am preparing her taxes and will take longer than expected..." bla bla bla. The next day I went back...since 5:00 pm. till 9:00 p.m. I was there. It took long because to top it off I found out in the middle of the preparation that he did not have his tax i.d. Number and was constantly stopping to call his supervisor at another location for her to enter the password for him to continue with the preparation. To make the story short, at the end he forging the supervisor's signature because she would not answer. After I told him my refund was not what I expected he kept on telling me that he didn't know why if he entered everything properly, and used all my forms (1 w2, 1 miscellaneous form, and one form for my mortgage interest). I told him I made the same last year, and there was a difference of $1000?? I also questioned at the beginning that what were going to be the fees. He said thirty something dollars, but that he didn't know until everything is input on the system. At the end he tells me $379.95 total fees (Federal tax preparation $269.00, $16.00 Data and Document Storage, $30 to have it direct deposit directly from the IRS, and $12 on another fee). WELL, then I start calling other locations to see if someone could go over my taxes because I felt that they were done wrong. I took it 2 days later to another tax preparer. She went over them and told me I didn't have my 1040 form. I noticed that the first tax preparer did not print one out, but since I was there for almost 4 hours I did not notice. She then told me that everything looked good, but that she would leave it for her supervisor to review it to have a more knowledgeable opinion. Well I didn't get a call till 2 days later from a supervisor. She told me it looked good and accurate, and that the reason I was getting a smaller refund was because made $3,400 more last year (keep in mind that I left all my paperwork there with her so I did not know why she was saying that to cross-reference). So confused I was thinking to myself, "Why is she saying $3400???" So after all said and done I went to pick up my forms the next day and I noticed that on my 1040 form they put on my income of $3,400 the mortgage interest. The dumb ass tax preparer that did my taxes input the interest as my income. So I call the supervisor, no answer. I texted her from her personal phone number from one of the times she had called me from because nobody would answer at that location, so I text her at 8:00 a.m. Telling her that it was not my income and that all along I was telling them that they were done wrong. She didn't reply till the next day in the night, all confused of my questioning, she tells me that she will go through it again, for the second time. The following day she tells me that my refund needed to be amended, that it was done wrong, so I told her "that's what I have been telling you," and I told her "you had already gone through my paperwork 2 times and the 3rd time you notice and because I have been harassing you to please look through it." That it was wrong telling them 3-4 times???? I also got my instant Walmart gift card and the $200 advance one week later, so it is not a instant Walmart gift card or a $200 advance, no no never people please go with them. They are horrible, worst nightmare ever... Don't lose your time and money and worried that they will do an error, and always ensure yourself with the gold guaranteed service. Because they will screw up. Guaranteed! Worst customer service. You go with Jackson Hewitt you are on your own, might as well do them yourself.
This company set up tax services at Walmart. I thought it would be a reasonable price. My husband and I file jointly. We do not have multiple jobs; our taxes are simple. What did they charge? $412. DO NOT USE THIS SERVICE. LEARN FROM MY MISTAKE. IF I can prevent someone from getting ripped off, I'll be happy. VERY BAD COMPANY.
Pretty simple I went into my local Jackson Hewitt office to file my taxes. Your company offers a $50 Walmart just for filing. I've never received the card. I've contacted the local management Brain who said it would be fixed within one hour. That was 6 days ago.
I went to Jackson Hewitt for the 1st time in Walmart to get my taxes done. I got there at 2:30. They had a clock saying they will be back at 3:00. The person that prepared my taxes did not get there until 3:30. It was 2 of us waiting for her. When she got there she did mine 1st and told the man that was waiting to sit at the desk behind her. She rushed through my taxes I guess because she was late. I ask her how much I get for my home taxes and the interest on my home. She could not tell me that. She told me it was included in my return. She told me how much I can get on the repairs I had done on my furnace but not my house. I was not satisfied with that. They e-mailed me a survey to do. I let them know I was not happy with my answers. They said someone will contact me. A person called and left me a voice mail with no return number. On Feb. 5th I called the 1-800 number they connected me with my area. I spoke to a man and he said someone would call me back yesterday. No one did. I wanted direct deposit so I pulled out my check book to give her the routeing and account number. She had the man sitting behind her very close. She ask me to say my information out loud to her twice. That was very unprofessional to me. I have been getting my taxes done since I was 16. I'm 53 now and no one ever did that. They would ask me to give them a voided check and they would type it in. I let someone else that do taxes look them over to see if she put my home on it. I found out that she did not give me a detail summary of my taxes. Then when she was going to show me the taxes she ask me, "How much I said you were going to get back? Did I say 4 thousand?" That really put up rag flags letting me know something was wrong. I watched her look at my home taxes. It is like she did not know what she was looking at. All I want is someone besides her to go over my taxes. I paid too much money to them for them to ignore me.
My boyfriend and I went to JH to get our taxes done. From the time we sit down the rep was not interested in our questions, but she was worried about leaving and going home. She ran us up and made someone else finish them. The rep that finished up was a very angry person. He was very red in his face with anger and began to get smart with me. I told him from the time I sat down I had a $10 refer a friend coupon. He then got to the end and I reminded him of my coupon once again. He then gets very upset and says "you want me to void it over $10". I told him "no, but I mentioned it a couple of times before this". He then takes the papers out of the printer and tosses them at me. From there on out he was disrespectful. I asked to talk to his supervisor and he got even more upset. She was just as unprofessional as he was because she took his side and told us to leave. This happened in the Johnson County, KY area. I have to say I will never EVER use them again. I'm in the process of trying to have something done. Very unprofessional, lack of interest in what they're doing and very disrespectful.
I went to get my taxes done on the 2nd February, Jackson Hewitt saying "come to Walmart and let us do your taxes and we will give you $50.00 WalMart gift card." So I did not receive it so I call them on the 5th February to see why I did not get. Now they said I had to pay 150.00 in order to get it since I paying 45.00 for my federal and 35.00 for my state I will not get one. It never stated that you have to pay 150.00 fee. I look and I cannot find it.
I have been with Jackson Hewitt over 10 years. Had good service in office. Experience for the last four years at this office, until now. They are falsifying and false advertisement on the 500 dollar loan. They say it's 2 hours wait time, it's been over 17 hours and still waiting. People should not do this due to the aggravation if you have bills to pay. I need money now. You might as well wait.
Filed on January 20, was accepted within hours. The only other status update I received was from the irs.gov website telling me of a DDD of 2/4/15. Well, today is the 15th, I still have no taxes. $300 in tax preparation fees to wait over 15 days. WTF Called, not one person seemed to have a clue. Was told because I selected the JH Preferred Card it would take another 24-24 hours to process my refund. What a joke. This is the longest I have ever waited for a return. This company is a rip off, their bank is a hot mess that hold your funds, and they do not even keep you updated on your taxes. Don't look for any updates from them. The only emails you will receive is when you file. No status update emails, and their website of no use whatsoever. For 15 days my status has read "Pending" on their website. PLEASE DO NOT USE THESE IDIOTS!
Paid 130.00 dollars to have taxes done with jackson Hewitt - was almost guaranteed to have return in 7 to 10 days. Well that never happened friends. Went to H&R block after me and got theirs already. Won't ever go back or ever recommend that place.
I went to JH for 1 reason only and that was for the $500.00 advance. The girl verified everything except the most important things. IRS REJECTED MY TAXES. SHE FIXED IT... AGAIN I WAS REJECTED. Fixed it again 3rd time IRS excepted it but I lost the $500 advance. Also didn't get the instant $50 Visa card load. Was told the owner would write a $50.00 check. I went to the office, waited 20 minutes because he was with other customers I had to go. I had no more time for the bs I let them know that's why I stop coming to them 3 years ago. The owner didn't honor my appointment. I was there @ 6. Wasn't seen until 7pm. JH on Baker Rd. in Acworth Publix plaza is no good. Cost almost $450 twice as much as I usually pay. Had I known I wasn't getting the advance I would have never looked that way or stepped in those ridiculous doors. The owner needs to hire people. Only himself and 1 person. They have people waiting for hours. I watched 3 customers leave. Horrible business practices. 0 stars. I wish I would have got the ** out of there!!! I pray I don't have any other problems. I will not stand for it!
I walked into the office located in Sears in Pompano City center. The office was empty, it had only two desks with a bunch of empty space. The employee approached, hardly spoke english. I asked "what is the cost for your services?", he stated they start at $89. I said "let's do it". After he entered all my information, he told me that they wanted to charge me $433. I feel that they should be upfront with the fees for their services. Very upset with my experience.
This is my, 3rd year being a JH customer and I haven't dealt with such rude people. This specific JH in Texarkana, TX on, New Boston Rd right infront of Walmart to be exact. All of those I've spoken with were rude and disrespectful, especially ** the office manager. I entered in the wrong routing number, on my returns. Instead of giving me, any kind of information the woman kept redirecting me with a rude attitude. Finally after about 5 times she says "Oh good Lord I don't know anything about that, it's gone." First you could've said you didn't know anything about it in a nice way. Secondly telling people their refund is gone because you don't know how to respond to a question is real serious. Ultimately I called another branch and I hate, I didn't get her name but she was very helpful... She got the info I needed. Which she told me once the funds don't go through due to the wrong routing number being given, it'll go back to the IRS, and be sent in a paper check form to the tax payers who sent it. Anyway I'm highly pissed at the situation being handled the way it was handled. Those people will definitely give JH a bad name.
After my experience with your company, I will not be returning. I did my research on your company ahead of time before my final step into my tax preparation, called the customer service line, asked my questions, inquired as to the offers you guys giving out, etc (basically I was on the phone for over an hour). Now, I'm a fairly easy case, although a tad bit more than an EZ. I came in, had a wonderful time with my tax woman named Stella, she was great and knowledgeable and we had a fun chat. The reason I won't be returning is because I came in strictly for the $200 dollar advance your company advertised and I was told my credit (which is poor) wouldn't be an issue. I went through every step asked of me and was denied. Okay, fine I was denied, so logic would dictate that because I was denied for my loan that I could instead receive the other incentive offer. I called and left a message, I was polite, even though I was upset. I waited several hours for a return phone call, and when someone named Stephanie finally called me back, she told me that "No" I was not allowed to exchange the advance for the $50 dollar Walmart giftcard. I understand if I was denied because of other reasons, which I wasn't. I was denied for the loan on my taxes based on my credit. I asked this question specifically and was told that "No" my credit would not be an issue. While I am not the type of person to expect free gifts, but when it is the ENTIRE reason I leave HR Block (albeit their disgusting service and horrible tax preparers). I expect either what I was promised, if not an apology gift for ALL this research I did and time invested in attempting to get my taxes done. It's sad to say that at this point, your company has lost a customer with a HUGE social pool that I WAS going to give your business cards to. Now, I will NOT be handing out your cards and whenever my siblings ask me where I got my taxes done, I will ALWAYS say, "whatever you do, don't go to Jackson Hewitt." I would rather go back to HR Block from here on out, their bad customer service and all, because frankly, they deliver what they say they'll do. Good bye Jackson Hewitt, I for the moment will NEVER be returning unless my situation is rectified.
I usually do my own taxes. This year Jackson Hewitt advertised $200 no credit check. Only requirement is to get back over $1000. That sounded great because like the commercial said $200 after the holidays is always needed. I checked the website to make sure nothing else was hidden - NOTHING. I went to get my taxes done at an office that has been there for years so I did not think it would go wrong. They did offer it at all. I contacted the main office via website. They said all the locations are independently owned and it is up to them to offer it. Will not be scammed again.
Idk about the rest of the people but I work too hard to be lied to about what they are going to. And nearly 400 dollars to do your taxes is outrageous. I need my money and I'm sure the rest of you do as well. When you do your taxes please use someone else. Being lied to and ripped off in this day and time is just too much.
The tax preparer was new and admitted as I was signing papers that this was her first real return ever. I was on edge already when she kept asking what each pop up on her screen meant. The IRS deposited my return to them on 1/30/15 and they can't find it. I've spoken to 5 different "supervisors" and the only common information is they don't see it. I think their new "tax pro" goofed and had it sent elsewhere. This is frustrating!
Last year it took 5 months to get my return because they screwed up filing and tried to blame me saying I gave them false information. I got no apology. I made an appointment this year and they take other people without appointments before me.
I contacted JH (live chat) because the injured spouse form wasn't showing up even though I filled it out twice on the software. No help from customer service. Then, I noticed when I went to print my sheets out that our moving expenses form was incorrectly filled out. The software wasn't adding information from the W-2 onto the form, there is no way for me to add it manually to fix it. Everything was added up incorrectly and customer service people were rude and didn't seem to know what the heck I was even talking about. I tried to email them and same thing. NEVER USE JACKSON HEWITT, unless, of course, you want the IRS to contact you that your taxes are wrong. This company doesn't seem to care either. Don't use them.
I have been a customer of JH for 13 years. I provide childcare to a working couple and have followed them from Ohio to North Carolina and now to Louisiana. I have never filed anywhere but JH. I have always been satisfied with their work, a couple times maybe there has been a preparer that I didn't care for but all in all they haven't made any mistakes and I have always left satisfied. However....lol. This year (2015) I went into a Lafayette La location to do my taxes and my preparer was very sweet and fast and careful to double check all info. She then told me that I qualified to apply for a 500$ advance and as long as I didn't owe the IRS I would qualify. I wasn’t aware of this before I came so I didn't look into it. My credit isn't the best so I made sure it wasn't based on my credit score and finally agreed to apply. She told me I would get a text or email from Jackson Hewitt and to complete the steps and it would be loaded on the same 50$ gift card they gave me "just because". I left thinking, "Cool, rent is due and this will help replenish my funds thereafter." My preparer told me that it could take 10 mins to get the text or up to several hours. I am on day 3 as of now. Thinking back I gave her my home number before she ever even mentioned the loan so how will I even get a text? She never confirmed that I could receive texts. I call up there and they tell me I will get it by email, which I do remember her confirming, just not for the loan portion. I call up there again after a day has gone by and they tell me it could take up to 48 hrs. So like I mentioned it's day 3 and still no text or email. I wasn't expecting it so I'm not mad that I don't have it. I'm worried they are going to say they gave it to me and still take it out of my refund. They are not able to go back and see what contact info they gave or check the status or do anything in that regard except tell customers something different every time they call. I think they need to train their employees better on new products and be able to provide answers or solutions to services they offer. After researching this infamous loan on the Internet it is quite obvious that I am not alone in this situation. I am very uneasy and hope that I don't get it now and that I will just get back what I was told...not less the 500$. Lesson learned...again. IF IT SOUNDS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE...IT IS!!!
I went to the location at 11063 West Colonial Dr., Ocoee, FL 34761 to meet with Hewitt representative Ms. **. A few weeks ago I was quoted a price to do my taxes with ** at 200-400 dollars. I am a truck driver, so I was satisfied with this quote. I called to make an appointment and was given an appointment date of 1-31-15 at 1:00 PM. I arrived for my appointment on time and was greeted and was told they would be with me shortly. They proceeded to help two or three other people that walked in the door after me. When I made them aware that I had an appointment they said "Oh, sorry, we thought you were with someone else." 5 minutes later they started my taxes. The girl’s name was something like **. At this time she tells me my price would be $600. I politely told them "No thank you. I was quoted a different price by ** and I am not paying that amount." I took my stuff and walked out the door. I started looking through my paperwork and thought I left something sitting at her desk so I walked back in and asked her if I did. She said I didn't and told me to leave and the next time I stepped back in her door she was going to call the police. I did nothing whatsoever to provoke her. I turned around and walked out.
I been going to Jackson Hewitt for years. I have never had a problem till this year. I spend a lot of money to get my taxes done and always receive my taxes in a timely matter. Well this year I have waited til California office feels like releasing our checks to the Ohio office. They are taking their good old time. That not right when they feel like it. I am very upset about this. I shouldn't have to wait on my money. They were paid around 300 to file my taxes. I will never wait on a check from them again. And the Ohio office don’t seem to care either. The day they receive it they should be releasing it to their offices.
Made the appointment for my taxes online. The website said they would confirm the appointment by email or text message. Didn't happen. Strike one. When I went to actually file my taxes, it was advertised that you would receive a $50 gift card for doing your taxes with them. What they don't tell you until the last minute is that there are certain conditions to get the gift card. Strike two. Then I was told I could get a $500 advance for my refund. Again, certain conditions apply and you're not told this until the last minute. Strike three, you're out. These people need more training and preparation. I will not go back until they do.
So it's been 50 minutes of waiting for the preparer to resolve a customer's refund card did not get loaded after 24 hours, when it was suppose to be loaded after 1 hour. Still waiting....
I went to do my taxes yesterday at their WalMart location in 4301 S University Drive in Davie, Florida. Got there and after waiting 3 hrs and see that everyone that sat down to do taxes before me walk out without doing them, I guess after they experienced the same that I did. My taxes are straight forward format and normally takes to HR block 10 minutes, she took an Hr to enter the info in the computer. Before I sat down I ask her (agent Sharon) that if I qualify for the 50 Dollars WalMart card that is in every advertising everywhere. She said YES. Then, after she told me that they will charge 130.00 Dollars if I pay with the money that was going to be returned to me, OR 58 dollars if I pay cash on the spot; and of course after a non-convincing explanation of why I did not qualify for the 50 dollars gift card and also telling me that it is what it is and that she also felt bad that JH did business like that. SHE OFFERED ME A GREAT CHOICE AFTER..... AND IT WAS TO TAKE ALL MY PRIVATE INFORMATION TO HER HOUSE AND FOR 40 DOLLARS SHE WILL GAVE ME MY TAXES THE DAY AFTER, WITH EVEN MORE RETURN THAN JH? I totally flip because I could not believe that I spent all together 5 hrs with this nightmare. Not to mention that I got online and I saw the very same complaints plus more serious one regarding the way that they operate. Then I tried to call someone and the customer service people in the 1 800 number did not know what to do; there is no number to complaint, you are force to enter the ZIP code and talk to the same person that did you bad. None of the JH numbers or the website have a set up to fill a complaint. That tells me how unprofessionally are this people. It is too bad when a company like that use poor or working class to make their millions. I will keep going with my campaign of letting everyone knows what they do. At the end of the day we have the voice with social media.
Had my taxes done there for 13 years and every year I get charged over 300 dollars. This year it was over 500$. They say it's the going fee. I was so upset but I feel so ripped off when I leave there. This I know has to be a ripoff. How can you let them get away with this... They have gotten thousands of dollars from me over the 1 year I have went to them.
I went in and sat down while and the lady from Jackson Hewitt said she hated preparing taxes for black people. This was inside of Walmart in hermitage on Lebanon Rd Tn.
Refund significantly lower than last year, I questioned it and no attempt to review was made. My preferred card was issued, link in email sent me to wrong site. Even called on the night I filed-- was told it was fine. Again another day goes by-- nothing. Finally I stop today and it was obvious I wasn't a priority when customers walked in. Was told I receive a call. So far nothing. I then review my stored documents to realize he entered wrong names for my kids, which were changed and entered last yr. We then got denied for the $500 cash advance because by the time I found out problem, I passed the 48 hr apply period and was denied. And now the preferred card says blocked and I question everything, I was charged almost $400. I'm extremely angry as nobody again answers my questions.
I had my taxes done at the Port Charlotte branch and Yolanda was very rude when I called about my debit Visa card, I have never used one issued from any tax service and I activated it online. However, it did not activate and so I called my tax preparer about this issue. Yolanda was very rude and condescending. Stated, "I have never received a call about the cards and activation." Very condescending throughout my tax prep as well. I will never have my taxes done here again!
Issued government refund check from a bank out of Ohio and is not honored in Florida. Please look into the matter. Why are they allowed to issue checks that cannot be cashed? That is absurd. Amscot takes 10% to cash. Please check into this.
Went to have taxes filed. Went there two years ago and paid $104 for 2 W-2s. This time had 2 W-2s and unemployment paper. After info was put it was told it would be $293. Also advertised a $50 Walmart gift card and did not even receive that. No extra deductions or paperwork. RIDICULOUS!
Well I can honestly say I'm 100% not satisfied with Jackson Hewitt. Went and had our taxes done and after that all was said and done and we paid them 400.00 to prepare our taxes and even purchased Peace of Mind. We got an email from the IRS saying we had to complete a form because we got health insurance through covered California. So we went back and talked to the lady that did our taxes and even spoke with her boss on the phone and was told when we get the form from the IRS we have to fill it out and bring it back to them to have it amended in to our taxes and that we will have to pay an additional 50 to 100.00 dollars extra because we didn't understand the question the preparer asked us when we did our taxes before we found out about this form and neither did the lady that did our taxes. And evidently when they ask you if you gotten insurance through a marketplace corp we should of said yes instead of no since they said getting government help like covered California is classified as getting insurance from a marketplace. So now we are going to get penalized for not understanding what that was and the preparer didn't know either and she admitted that she didn't and the amendment fees is not covered under the Peace of Mind guarantee or their 100 percent guarantee. Not happy at all about that. And I will not be going back there!!!
I have been going to JH since for at least 13 years and never have I had a problem. I can say that 1 time I did have a preparer who was not experienced as the others and had a difficult time. She did however call for help and they assisted. They always try to get you the best refund positive. They are friendly, helpful and my return usually comes in a few weeks. They really have not explained the cost, but I think it is due to the fact that I am a regular client. Kudos, JH and esp Angela @ the Hazleton, PA office for a job well done!
I took my income tax papers to Jackson Hewitt (JH) 2 weeks before April 15, 2014. They said they would call me in 3 or 4 days. I never got a call. I started calling but there was no answer or message center pickup. I went by the tax office inside Sear, in Cupertino Square Mall in Cupertino, CA. The door was locked and lights out each time. I started calling JH and got a tax office in Newark, CA would said they were locked out, could not get in to get any of the paperwork, and I would have to get all the paperwork replaced. Stay away from Jackson Hewitt!
Never again will I go to this company!! Tax preparer did not put my entire acct number in the computer for my direct deposit tax return... Was told could not fix. It would have to get a paper check instead. NEVER AGAIN... and they still charged me.
This was my Husband's & my 1st time filing after marriage. He went to Jackson Hewitt to file. Neither of us really know anything about taxes, so when he went in he filed Married Separate because the woman who was "helping" him did not tell him that it would be beneficial for us to file jointly. The only thing she asked was if he wanted to file Jointly or Married Separate with NO EXPLANATION whatsoever. Anyway, he ends up with $1,000+ and I tell him, you know what you got such a great return I'll see them too. So I go in and after explaining that I have to file Married Separate the gentleman I saw explained that was a mistake, and explained why it was a mistake, but went ahead as I had no choice but to also file Married Separate at the time. Since I tried to file Married Separate I was not going to get ANY credit of the interest paid on my student loans and even less of the taxes I did pay. If I hadn't stopped the process I would have gotten a return of $77 and been charged $250 by Jackson Hewitt! Now we have to wait until February 15th to do an amendment where we will be charged AGAIN. To be clear, the gentleman I saw was very helpful and paused the process so I would not have to pay $250. The woman my Husband saw, however, SCREWED US OVER by not explaining the difference. For a company that is supposed to help people who don't know how to do their own taxes, the hit and miss quality of their employees in terms of knowledge and helpfulness is SEVERELY LACKING. If you have a basic understanding of Taxes I'm sure they are great. If you don't, pay attention so you don't get SCREWED! I told the gentleman I saw today that I was extremely unhappy with this, that had we known the difference we never would have attempted to file Married Separate and all he could do was shrug his shoulders and say he was sorry, that not everyone explains things like he does, and that there was nothing that could be done until February 15th when we would be able to do the Amendment.
I went to jackson hewitt to have my taxes done. I filled out their information form including social security numbers and 2014 i.r.s. security pin # knowing they would need it to do my taxes. After finding out they could not do the services that they advertise I chose not to have them do my taxes yet they already had all my identity information and when I wanted the form with my personal information back, she told me she had to keep it and pulled it out of my hand. I told her to scratch my social security numbers off it. She refused and hurried up and stuck the form in a drawer so I couldn't get it And refused to give me the form or to remove my personal numbers from them. They do not need to have my social security number and irs pin when they are not doing any services for me.
It's been over 3 days and I still haven't received my money on JH preferred card. Have tried and tried to resolve it with Jackson Hewitt, with no resolve, that is false advertising and stealing from honest Americans. Instant means right then not 5 days later.
I went to Jackson Hewitt last yr for my 2013 return to have them file my taxes and was told I would only be getting 200 something back so I decided to go to PFT's and ended up getting close to 800 back. So I knew better than to go there this year so this is my own fault. They messed up my taxes again this yr lol. However I just wanted to warn people. I'm a family of three and even though I make more than minimum wage being the only income to my household I pretty much live paycheck to paycheck, needing the cash and with the $50 bonus as soon as you file was a plus to me and my friend said they did really good on her taxes so I thought I'd give it a try this year again (my mistake). I went in on Wed night to file my taxes. I got there about 5:50 few minutes in to filing my taxes. I was told she would have to leave at 6:15 to go pick her kids up. I had forgotten my husband's ID so needed to run back home and grab it anyways so to me that wasn't a big deal. I went and got his wallet then sat in the cold for about another 20 min for her to get back. Finally she arrives and has four children with her two that was hers and the other two she was babysitting until their dad came to pick them up. The entire time the kids was screaming running around busting open ketchup packets shredding paper towels so it was hard for me to focus on the little info she was telling me. I felt she kinda just rushed me along to get me out the door but as long as everything was fine then I was okay with that. Well this is now Sunday and my $50 that was supposed to be on my card and hour later Wed night is still not there. When the lady handed me my card she told me it was already activated and my pin was the last four of my ssn. After getting home and reading the instructions on my card I found out I was supposed to activated it myself but she had already done it for me. Anyways I have been calling Jackson Hewitt several times a day trying to figure out what is going on and being told different things. The first day they said give it 24 hours. Next day 48 hours. Then the third day they realized my card was messed and she had activated it wrong and that my card could only be used as debit. My whole tax return is going to be on this card and I cannot get any cash off of it. They tell me to call my card and hit #0 or 0# they can't remember which it is to talk to an operator. I tried both SEVERAL times. It ends my call every time I called back and they said their call volumes are so high they are not accepting calls at this time! Then finally today they are saying I won't be receiving my tax return or the $50 on my card. I will be getting it by check. The whole point of me paying them for this card is because it's faster and now I'm out that money too and to some people 10$ isn't a lot but to me I can use that for a lot of different things. When I told the lady on the phone I wasn't sure why I paid for the card since I can't use it she said "Oh, you paid for this card?" Nobody in this place knows what they are doing! NEVER ever again will I be as stupid to go to this place again and I highly recommend finding somewhere else to do your taxes. I thought H&R Block was bad. They are amazing compared to this place! This has to be the most unprofessional place I've ever been. Jennifer ** was the name of the lady who filed my taxes and I got them done at the Tell City, IN location.
I live in Cleveland Ohio, I walked into A Jackson Hewitt location In my neighbor at 12:30 on a Saturday afternoon thinking this was going to be a simple easy process. I am a single mom, one child, pre school teacher - same job for 9 years. Simple right? I don't own anything and I get back around 5,000. I was very prepared when I went in I had all my tax information packet from my 2011 2012 Jackson Hewitt so I'm thinking this will be simple. I got all my information with me plus my Jackson Hewitt tax packets from the past years. Boy oh boy I was wrong!!! The worst Saturday of my life, the only reason I decided to go was because of their 500 dollar promotion that I was supposed to have loaded on my JH preferred vanilla Visa card. Well 2 days later my money is still not loaded on the card when I call the store location back plus other locations. No one has a answer as to where is my money that was taken from my tax return. So Jackson Hewitt owes my 550 dollars which was never loaded onto the card. Honestly this is the only reason I returned to Jackson Hewitt because I was under the impression I would have have some of my tax money return on the spot! This is only a lie to wheel you in. I will never in my life return to Jackson Hewitt. I should have followed my first mind and did turbo tax myself for free!!! My second complaint is that when I got home and looked at my tax return, the Jackson Hewitt employee spelled my address wrong on my tax return. Tell me how can you mess up when you have my driver's license in front of you with my correct address and my W2s right in front of your face with my address on it plus my packets from the past with the same address? These people are not trained well and their gimmick of money loaded on a card on the spot in one hour is only a lie to wheel you in. Please people don't fall for it!!! Don't trust your valuable private information with this company and obviously the money on the spot you can live without it. I'm proof of that haha!! But 550 dollars of my tax return money I have not received yet and Jackson Hewitt is responsible for that!!!
I went and had my taxes done today at one of Jackson Hewitt locations at Walmart. I have always done my taxes online with Turbo Tax. I figured I would try having them done for once. Let me tell you, I will never do it again. I was charged 290 to have them done then a finance charge to have them direct deposited. Not only that I had to correct the agent that was doing them. She was filing me as single instead of Head Of Household. I was very dissatisfied with my service and being that I work at Walmart, I really can't afford to pay someone 341 to get my taxes done when I can do them myself online for 70 bucks, and get them done right. Jackson Hewitt is a Rip Off.
I had my taxes done today. I am a single dad and filed the EZ form. I was charged 450 dollars!!! I was told that it was that the price was high because of the fact that I was claiming my son. They would not tell me in advance. Then is was rejected so she resent it and because of that my price doubled!!!! I was told this after it was sent not before. I felt cheated and deceived. Do not go here... They will not tell you the cost ahead of time.
Woman with name Fran she told me you will have $50 in your card is discount. Never happened. When I call she tells me tomorrow everyday.
I'll never file with Jackson Hewitt again. They promise that you'll get absolutely the most money back on your return, but what they don't tell you is you'll spend the little extra money, which maybe an hundred dollars paying them. Their fees are ridiculous. I filed there because of their promised incentive. Well, they lied. They ran me around 2-3 days then later told me I couldn't get the 200$ incentive, but that was after they charged me 473$ to file my return.
I went to Jackson Hewitt... told the lady I'm filing head of household. She puts down single.... then I get approved for the $200.00 loan. I couldn't activate my card so they changed it to a gift card.... who in the ** go pay money for a gift card. They don't listen and they don't care. They is a rip off and bribe you so you can file with them. Jackson Hewitt of Lancaster SC in Walmart... I WILL NEVER FILE WITH Y'ALL AGAIN.... WISH I COULD TAKE YOU TO COURT.
They charged me $609.00 for preparing my taxes. At first they said 450.00 then afterwards it was 609.00! I didn't even get much back! I want my money back at least half of what I paid. Can anybody help me?
I saw that Jackson Hewitt was giving a $50 prepaid visa card if you file your taxes with them and since I have been recently laid off, I was in desperate need of some extra cash. I was not told until halfway through the filing process that your refund has to be over $150 in order to be eligible for the prepaid card and also if I decided not to go through with the filing process that I would need to pay a $49 fee for their time. I did not work much in 2014 so my refund amount was $321 after my earned income credit was applied. That made me extremely happy at first because I assumed I would receive the gift card and have a couple hundred dollars in a few weeks. But then my tax preparer informed me that I did not qualify for the card because I was charged $216 in fees! I told the preparer that I should just e-file it myself because that amount of fees is ridiculous! But because I did not have $49 on me, I had no choice but to allow the filing to go through. I am extremely angry about these crooks at Jackson Hewitt. They reel you in with a free offer and then pile on enough fees to make sure that you aren't approved for it. I did not have any children to claim or property taxes and think it is insane to pay 2/3 of my refund in fees. I will tell everyone I know to never ever use Jackson Hewitt. This company should definitely be investigated because something is definitely wrong.
I went in to JH one year to do my taxes. The lady was rude and the fees are too much. Out of a whole year of working I only $500 back. Went to HnR Block and bam I was missing lots of money. NEVER FILE WITH THEM.
I don't know how to not give these ignorant individuals a star. I had my taxes completed there back in 2009, what a mistake. Got a notice from the Internal Revenue Service that I owed an additional $6,000. Well I didn't make much more than that to begin with. After looking carefully at my tax forms these morons typed in the income as $202,041. Well if I made that much this particular year, I must have hit the freaking lottery. DO NOT, I REPEAT DO NOT HAVE YOUR TAXES COMPLETED BY THESE IDIOTS. The morons at Walmart don't have sense enough to hide their screens with customer's information visible to the public. Stood at one terminal for 10 minutes watching everything the lady was typing and asking the individual sitting in front of her.
Filed taxes and someone had claimed one of my children. Instead of them taking care of the problem they wanted me to pay them $149.00 to get an answer to my question. So no questions answered and they haven’t given me any information.
If I could give zero stars, I would. I went in, thinking coming here would be beneficial. It was not. The lady Mrs. Rita ** at the location of Lemmon Ave. Dallas, TX entered in my social security wrong, which in turn, is preventing me from finishing off my amendment return to mail it to IRS. I have called them numerous of times, no answer. I have left voice mails, no return calls. They claim she teaches a class. She has no right or skill to do so. Her students are in for a rude awakening. I have to call other locations just to set up an appointment with her. This has cost me 70 dollars, with the fact that I still did not get what I needed and have to go somewhere else to fix my tax return once again. I would like to have a refund of my money for wasted time.
Went to the Jackson Hewitt on Plainfield ave in GR Mi. They failed to mail my 2013 amendment by the due date causing me to be out 700.00. When I called the office I was told that it wasn't their problem, and that they would not honor their guarantee. When I called the 1800 they just forwarded the complaint to the office that messed up in the first place. I am taking them to small claims court!
JH did my 2012 tax return incorrectly. Received a notice from the IRS stating I owed $7000.00. JH admitted the mistake was theirs but refused to do anything. I will be seeking legal advise.
On August 12, 2014 at around 12:30pm EST I tried to create an account with "My JH" online. I entered all info correctly AT LEAST 10 times and it would not create my account. (I had my taxes done in April of 2014 at the Walmart in Lebanon, KY). I called the 800 number for JH and got connected to a rude customer service person who was impatient with me and never solved my problem. She hung up on me when I told her that I felt she was being rude. Then I tried at least 10 local and not so local numbers to talk to a human being at JH near me. Never an answer, just voice machines. I called the 800 number about 15 times after this and it was CONSTANTLY BUSY. I have really wasted my very limited and valuable time at my office this morning and have a lower opinion of this organization which promotes itself as veritably UBIQUITOUS but which is actually nowhere to be found when you actually DO need them.
I went to JH for 2 years. The first year wasn't so bad when there was a knowledgeable accountant there but he left. I'm sure I know why. The second year was horrible. That was 2012 and we're still paying for it. I had to file in two states and Fed. in 2012. They did such a poor job, I overpaid in both states. Now I find out the IRS is claiming I UNDERPAID them by over $3,0000! They had better go to bat for me or I will definitely contact BBB and Angies List and anything else I can find that will let people know what they're getting. They have no clue what they're doing. I could see the accountant this year, for 2014, who is the only CPA at the office, was getting so flustered because he didn't understand my efforts to help them. I always fill out a tax organizer. Who doesn't understand what a tax organizer shows? He asked me to redo it on 1 page. I said I can't, the info I have won't FIT on one page. I since took it to H&R Block and the accountant there said piece of cake. So now I'm waiting to find out what will happen with the 2012 claim by the IRS that they were underpaid. Do not use the one in Rockland. They have no idea what they're doing. I would imagine the one in Walmart is no better. Horrible. Never again.
I filed my taxes in Perth Amboy, on Smith St. at Jackson Hewitt... Jan. 31st... Haven't received my taxes as of yet... lots of errors.. DO NOT USE Jackson Hewitt. They don't know what they're doing.
I just got off the phone with the IRS and they stated that my 2013 tax return was again rejected again. I received an email from Jackson Hewitt back in April 2014 stating that I needed to add my Adjusted Gross Income from 2012. I updated the amount and submitted again. I did not receive any other warning or emails from Jackson Hewitt letting me know that it was rejected a 2nd time. This has caused some problems. Also, I am unable to log into the system once again. This is getting a bit frustrating. I have used TurboTax and H&R Block over the years without any issues. I decided to use Jackson Hewitt because they were offering AT&T Employees a discount code, which NEVER worked either. Jackson Hewitt needs to hire a new IT development Team to work out their kinks in their online system.
My first experience with Jackson Hewitt was a disaster. I let an employee of Jackson Hewitt prepare my taxes with the hopes of it being successful and when the IRS contacted me to let me know it wasn't. Jackson Hewitt managers did not accept any responsibility and actually blamed me that my signature was photocopied. How could that possible be any mistake of mine, I'm not the preparer? I spoke with numerous of store managers, the district manager and the franchise manager and they all offered no assistance on the refund that was filed in April, but is said to be returned in July. They gave false hope that fees could be refunded and they NEVER returned calls like they always said they would. Jackson Hewitt has NO integrity and possess no loyalty or responsibility towards their customers. I wouldn't recommend anyone to step foot in any facility owned by Jackson Hewitt because the service is poor as well and their managing skills and ability to please their customers. I will never allow them to service me.
I'm still waiting on my second check. It's taking forever. Omg... and also it's just a small amount of money. I kind of regret... why didn't I just go back to HR Block - HONEST, FRIENDLY and FASTER.
I filed - told $38 for employee taxes, turned into $350. I’m poor WTH and I can’t reach them by phone. Help!
$400 for my simple tax returns??? WTF? I have never paid over $150 in the last 10 years. Their crap building was complete madness and they knew no more than any other accountant about tax services. How is this company still in business with today's access to Turbo Tax and other self-help computer tax programs? Oh yeah, they get $400 from suckers like me. I repeat... COMPLETE RIPOFF!!!!! It's not like you are getting a bigger return for the price.. You get what you get.. I will not return.
I went to Walmart to do my taxes. I ask the tax preparer how much it's going to cost. I was told $38.00. When we were done, he said it was going to be $375.00 and when my father saw it, he told me he paid $80.00 for a long form. I made $8,000.00 this year. I'm a student and I was going to get $800.00 back of which Jackson Hewitt is keeping $400.00. The person who did them, his name is ** at Walmart at 8500 Washington Blvd, Pico Rivera. Manager is **. This people are thieves.
My two sons were to get their taxes done for the first time. First of all they had an appointment and then went there only to be told to come back tomorrow....then when they did go there, they asked about how much it would cost. The representative looked at the materials brought in and said - probably about 38.00. So after the first son's was complete (approximately 20 minutes), she started on the other sons' taxes. My sons were discussing what the second son's cost would be and they said maybe a little more as he had income from other state. Long story short...one 20-minute son's session cost 38.00, the other son's - 368.00!!!!! WHAT A RIP OFF this company is. We asked for explanation and assistance and they replied that their prices are competitive and they cannot tell you what the price is ahead of time because it depends on how many forms they use. Get this...births boys are in the same college - three years apart in age - and neither earned over 3000.00 in the year. This company should be ashamed to take 7 times amount the money from one similar person without providing a head up, particularly when it was questioned. At least they could have said... "We won't know the price but it looks like you may have more forms and we do charge accordingly." If you have any chance at all.... DON'T USE JACKSON HEWITT!!!
Jackson-Hewitt made numerous errors on my Taxes. Cost me in excess of 1,000.00 dollars in refunds and additional 300.00 to have somebody else fix the mistakes. I complained to the local Franchise and was told that the owner would contact me. He never did, even after numerous call. I complained to Wal-Mart for allowing them to set up kiosks in the Super Centers. Store Manager complained to Jackson Hewitt. They told him that they would call me and rectify the situation. That was two weeks ago. NO calls. Nothing.
I had to cancel tax preparer Phillip ** service due to out of hand situation. They told me they will refund half of my money that I paid cash to them and I accept. Then they didn't give me my money and the owner name Nick yelled at me for asking for it. Beside new accountant make me get $500 more money on tax return so I said fine if I lose $200 I gain $500... Don't go there.
I filed my taxes about 4 or 5 year ago and when I called about picking money up, they said that my schooling bill took my whole tax check and then I started getting bills from school. They said nothing was ever paid. I can't find taxes from them. I'm lost in limbo. Don't know what to do.
I work out of state 10-11 months out of the year. I recently went to Jackson Hewitt for a multiple state tax return. I actually had to go to 2 different Jackson Hewitt places because the first one did not know what they were doing. The second one tried to tell me that I could not write off travel expenses. I had to argue food, lodging, mileage etc., was a write off as my primary residence is in Colorado. Now here it's over a month later and find out that after I filed e-file that they screwed up my Utah taxes, Oregon taxes, and Ohio taxes. Now that is fixed I find out that they are charging me $50.00 in bank fees. I asked for a refund and the Senior Manager Rick ** simply states they don't give out refunds and he won't allow it. I filed electronically paying for a tax service that will do a professional job, not a company that screws up taxes and hidden fees. I even stated that the lady who was doing my taxes went to help another customer leaving a new lady to finish up filing the taxes which was just signing. And she even asked for help on signing the documents.
Two handicapped individuals filed their taxes through Jackson Hewitt. The information given was not explained clearly about money that would be withheld. The amount for the service was over the top for the couple involved. The amount charged from last year to this year is 6 times what was paid last year. They still cannot get the information or an explanation.
I went to JH on Feb.17th 2014. It is now March 10th and today I get a letter from the IRS saying they need form SE to go with my 1099 misc. so, I can pay taxes due on SS and Med. This form should have been done by JH at the time I did my taxes. I went to the store at 2534 N. Meridian Ave. OKC, OK. 73107 and told them the issue and they did NOT pull my file or update any of my records within the store or computer. They did fill out form SE, but blamed my employer for putting my wages under Other Income on the 1099 Misc. and said it should have been listed as non-employee wages or something like that. When I was doing my taxes with JH, I told them I need to pay in to the IRS for my 1099 misc. I did not check the work they did because I paid almost 500 for them to do my taxes. Ok, so after the form SE is filled out, I said now we have to fax this letter and the form to the IRS and JH does not have a fax, REALLY? Now, I get to fax it to the IRS. Not only that, but of course no discount of any kind was given to me for their error. I now must wait six to eight additional weeks for my refund check to be processed by the IRS. I would have my refund now if JH would have got it right to begin with, but my tax preparer did not in any way make me pay taxes on my 1099 misc. These people are not trained enough to do peoples taxes. Tax School, what a joke! Only if you have basic taxes to file put in a 1099 misc. and your out of luck! Check their work before you leave the office. If you go back, they will not care for you in any way! Forget a discount! You will get a run around! Unhappy and very sad customer who has done taxes with JH a few years now. I really thought I could trust in them this year and I did, but should not have.
I went to Jackson Hewitt to have my taxes done and on this day the preparer had to enter my information multiple times because her system kept shutting down-this was the first sign that should have made me RUN AWAY right then. It took a while to complete because the system wouldn't allow her to move forward but the preparer finally got it to go through. Yes Jackson Hewitt JACKED IT UP SO BAD & then took a week to share with me that my return was REJECTED & that my SSN had possibly been used fraudulently or looks like someone may have already claimed me & filed using my SSN. They went on to say that because of this I would not be able to file electronically and could only mail it in which would take 6 to 8 weeks. After speaking with JH Managers and going back & forth calling IRS (not to mention the amount of time I spent on eternal hold-45 minutes to an hour- just to find out any kind of information) I let IRS know what was going on & they looked up my SSN in their system and told me that they did not find any other return filed with my SSN and that I needed to go back to my preparer to try to resolve the matter & that it may have been a system glitch or human error on their part and that I would more than likely have to file a paper return when something like this happens. I followed up with JH once again and they told me they would research it once more and go back in and refile my return... Well needless to say, they did just that and it was rejected a second time. This is when they said I needed to come back in & do a paper return but told me I would have to pay for my tax preparation fee ($350) up front before they could move forward... Well I was already HOTTER THAN FISH GREASE so they were told a few choice words and I let them know I was not coming back up there and that I would never be using them again. I mailed in my paper return & it's going on 4 weeks now and unfortunately I'm still waiting for my refund. :( I should have listen to my friend and used TAX ACT. She used them to file her return and it didn't cost her anything and she got her refund within 10 days direct deposited into her bank. DO NOT USE Jackson Hewitt, they are a complete JOKE!!!! WILL BE USING TAX ACT FROM THIS POINT ON! #TEAMTAXACTONLY
I filed our taxes using Jackson Hewitt online services, they drafted the fee from my bank account twice. Because of this, I had overdraft fees in the total of $108!!! I will NEVER use their services again!
JH prepared my returns for the years 2012 and 2013. They had my check for the 2012 then lost it and I was never contacted that they even had it till I filed 2013. Its been 3 weeks after filing the 2013 and I was told that my 2012 check still had not been printed and that the IRS is holding my check for the yr 2013 till corrections are made for the 2010 filing year. Better believe that the B.B.B is going to be hearing about this! They got their money and now I am out mine + more. SO ANGRY!! Do not use the JH in Everett, Washington.
Filed my taxes on 2-12-14. Was told to call back the next Friday and I should have my check. That day came and went with no taxes and I wasn't mad at all. So I waited and called the next week on a Wednesday... no taxes. So I called the next week on a Tuesday. I was informed my taxes would be there the next day for sure. Well again no taxes. I was upset by this time. If you're not for sure of the date don't keep having me to call. Talked to several people who weren't very knowledgeable of what they were talking about. Just frustrated when you keep getting the run around.
My fiance and I both filed at Jackson Hewitt. He prefiled first. I just went in with my W2. He filed 3 days after I did. I got my money back in less than 2 weeks. We assumed his would hit right after. 2 weeks later no refund. We call the office and spoke with the manager. He says “Oh the kids’ birthdates were not accepted.” How could this be? He has filed there with the kids on his before and the lady had his old tax returns, birth cert. and soc cards. And why were we never notified of their error? So he was very rude and didn't offer even an apology for their mistake. Now it’s well over a month since we filed and no money, and we are waiting on over $10,000! IRS won't help since it’s not 21 since they received it since J.H. screwed up and it didn't hit them till we should have had it. I asked another J.H. office and they scolded me for going to the office instead of the kiosk in Walmart. Are we ever going to get our money? Is the IRS going to think foul play since the dates were wrong the first time? My advice - go somewhere, anywhere else. And if you are in Florida stay far away from the office on 14th St. in Bradenton!!!!
My husband and I went in on Tuesday to get our taxes done by a Jackson and Hewitt preparer. This was our first time using them. The biggest nightmare occurred. It took her over 3 hrs to file our long form taxes. She typed with 1 finger... line by line... On Wednesday our taxes were denied due to missing information she forgot to submit. She called us on Wed and said her boss wanted to speak to us and we need to schedule an appointment. We went in Thursday morning and her boss said he would fix it and resubmit it to the IRS. Friday we got another call from them asking us for more information. We answered her Questions. Sunday she called us again and stated that we needed to come in the office to resign paperwork. Now I am really angry that my taxes haven't been submitted and its been almost 1 week since we filed. The preparer had informed me that they made some changes without them contacting us. I asked her to show me. She was reluctant to show me but, I wasn't signing anything until she showed me. She finally showed me. When she was printing out our paperwork she informed me that when I get home I can look over some other changes they had made. I found through comparing my taxes that they changed some of the numbers and also they were charging us more money, $25 more!! We were charged $629. I called and filed a complaint with the manager after calling for about 4 days straight. She agreed to compensate us. I later found out that she also messed up on filing our state taxes as well. I called the preparer back to let her know there was something wrong with our state taxes as well. She didn't take any responsibility for her actions at ALL!!!!! I told her I had called the manager to complain; she stated "she didn't care if I complained, who I complained to and I could complain to Obama if I wanted to"!! I had another preparer look at our taxes. Due to her mistakes and excessive filing fees we lost a lot of money. PLEASE BEWARE. Watch what your preparer is doing and ask questions.
Last year my child went to Jackson Hewitt for his tiny PT income. Filed EZ. But when he went back this year he was charged $90 for an EZ return. And then when he explained that his parents would claim them on their return. The preparer gave him basically convinced him to file anyway claiming himself. He sat at their office for 1 hr trying to get us on the phone because it didn't sound right and he told them he needed to clear it with us. SHE FILED THE RETURN ANYWAY. So now she doesn't want to amend the return due to the "points hit" it will cause her office. Even though she admitted to me she completely forgot to ask if he was in high school last year. "OH, I should have asked being he just turned 19" was her words. They whole office is scrambling trying to cover their butts now. I offered a solution to amend at no charge or to just refund his $90 but they can't stop trying to "explain their way out of it". Good God! Over $90???? Poorly run business.
The customer service at Jackson Hewitt is the worst. The lady that did my taxes was unprofessional and kept called me by the wrong name every time. The fees advertised are incorrect and they don’t disclose all the fees. When I requested to have my refund send to me they refused and told me that I would have to come back to pick up the check. They charged me $278.95 in fees for a simple tax with one dependent; federal tax $175.00 fee and state $32 fee and data and document storage $8.00 fee and assisted refund fees $63.95 and in addition a separate bank tax refund fee $32.95. Stay away from Jackson Hewitt tax service they are stealing money and the company seriously needs to be investigated by the government.
My tax return was returned because the one who prepared my taxes did not have all my account numbers on file. But Jackson Hewitt has been paid and I have nothing. This was my first time as a customer. And you better believe it is my last. When I walked in, one tax preparer was eating food from a big bowl in front of client while doing her taxes. How professional was that. I should have walk back out then. I tried to contact the supervisor Wendy **, apparently getting back to was not that important to her. It's been 72 hours still no response. I will never turn anyone onto using Jackson Hewitt!
I went to Jackson Hewitt at Walmart in Edison, NJ to have my taxes done on a Saturday. While the tax preparer was entering my information in to their computer, I read a notice posted at the desk. The notice basically said that taxes will be prepared, the consumer will be notified of the cost before filing of the taxes and if the consumer does not agree with the cost, then they will be charged $35 and given back their documents. I had to go home and return with another form which I gave to the preparer who was with another customer. I left and did not hear anything more from the preparer. On Sunday, I called Jackson Hewitt and spoke to another tax preparer. I asked how much my taxes were going to cost and she told me $250. I told her that was too much money for me and I wanted to cancel. I said that I would pay the $35. She told me that the tax preparer had already electronically filed my taxes and I should speak to her directly. I was surprised because the fee was never explained to me per the notice at the desk. On Wednesday, my original tax preparer called me and told me that she had submitted my taxes to the IRS already and that there was nothing that she could do. I explained that $250 was too much for me to pay. Basically, she said I should have said something to her on Saturday. But, she never told me how much I was going to be charged. So, the following Sunday, I called Jackson Hewitt to find out if I could pick up a copy my returns and documents (W2, property tax statements). I was told that I would have to speak to my tax preparer. I explained again what I wanted and the person who answered refused. So, I went to the office in person and I demanded my documents. The person at the desk was rude, nasty. I signed some documents and I noted that I was not notified of the cost of the taxes and that the taxes were not prepared properly. She told me that she could not give me any of my papers, documents until she shows what I wrote to her boss. I told her that if she did not give me my documents that I would call the police. She immediately handed me my folder. I walked away. She started yelling at me and grabbed my arm. I had no idea what was going on. I left and went to my car and realized I had someone else's folder along with mine. I went back to Jackson Hewitt and returned the other person's folder. My experience with Jackson Hewitt has been a nightmare. I was charged a ridiculous amount that I did not approve of. My tax preparer made a lot of mistakes. The employees that I dealt with were incompetent. I would not recommend Jackson Hewitt to anyone.
This is to inform you about my ill treatment at your 7310 Harvard location. Out of 3 different prep's, the last one eating popcorn at their terminal, I still have not had my taxes done. I will never use your co. again.
This was my first time using JH. Before I used the same lady and she did my taxes with no problem. I moved to new state. I went to JH to make sure my taxes was done right. I provided all information needed to do my taxes. This included My grandchild information. I received a under review from IRS. After I received this information I search all my records to see what was the problem. Come to find out no information was in JH file on my grandkids. I call JH and I was told that they did not have any information on grandkids and it was not their responsibility and my family is left with no money and I have bills to pay. I was told by JH that they could not help me.
I tried Jackson Hewitt last year. I will never go there again. I asked the woman if they did all three taxes (local, state, and federal). She assured me they did. I handed her my W2's, and an hour later, she assured me they were all done. I asked if I needed to come back in, and she said no. December, I receive a notice from the local tax office saying I did not file my taxes. I called Jackson Hewitt after trying to find my W2's. The woman said she would check and call me back. She never did. I called a week later and had to get an attitude with her before she agreed to check. She called a few minutes later and said that Jackson Hewitt didn't do local taxes. I told her what the woman had said, and that for the price I paid I expected all three taxes to be done. She said they charge an extra $10. As a courtesy, she would send me the form. She sent the W2 back that I needed for my local taxes. Why did they keep the W2 when they know they don't do the local taxes? Wouldn't you think I would need the W2 back to file my local taxes? I will NEVER go to Jackson Hewitt again. My employer did not take off enough local taxes, and now I owe interest every day it's not paid. If my local taxes had been done in the first place, then the debt would have been paid off, and my employer informed of the necessary change. I am very dissatisfied with Jackson Hewitt. I am returning to a local tax service who has never cheated me or lied to me.
I just used JH for the third and last time. The first time I used them the IRS informed me of a correction they made which caused me to get an additional $300 back. The second time JH screwed up again and we had to file a corrected return and I received another refund. This last time was enough to make me know not to return. First while the lady was working on my account a woman came in to pick up some signs and other Jackson Hewitt papers to take to a different JH office that she must have been working for. The lady who was waiting on me excused herself 3 times to go talk to the other lady. When she finally got back to my account she informed me I would be getting back $3000 and something. I told her that was impossible. Turns out she had only entered 1 of my 1099's and not the other. When I pointed that out to her she tried to justify it by saying I hadn't had taxes taken out of that one so it wouldn't change the tax amount. I told her it would still increase my income which in turn would decrease my refund. How is it possible she didn't know that? Maybe if she weren't so interested in the other woman she would have seen her mistake. Then she informs me I owed her what amounted to $132 per form even though she said it was only $100 per form. Needless to say, I will not be using them again.
The sign said $40 for a simple return. The tax preparer was rude and practically called my daughter a liar. He continually asked her if she was who she said she was. If her son really lived with her. She felt like a criminal. He asked her what she paid last year at the other company and she told him and he said he doubted it. In the end he charged her $280.00 for federal and $15.00 for state. I pay under $100.00 for complicated taxes. A poor company. He said they had their fees. She can't even get her return for 21+ days! STAY AWAY FROM JACKSON HEWITT.
After going to Jackson Hewitt on January 23rd of this year, in an effort to beat the rush and delay of last minute filing, I showed ten minutes before my appointment only to discover that the lady that walked in alongside me was taken first. I discovered when the tax preparer approached the counter that that lady was a walk in. I was told to take a seat and that she would take me next. Just as I was about to get up and leave, a male preparer walked in and rather than finish his lunch started my tax preparation. I was told that, "Just like last year, I would receive my refund in 5 to 7 business days". Ten business days later, I was still without my refund and beyond livid. I called the customer service hotline only to be told that JH's policy is to issue anticipated refunds in 21 business days or less from receipt of funds from the IRS. I explained that I had signed up for the rapid refund and that I expected them to honor their promise, the representative (Lois) told me to call the IRS myself to inquire as to how long it would take them to accept my electronic filing and issue my funds. After speaking with Marvin at the IRS, I was told that my return was received by them on January 28th, FIVE days later than my initial appointment. I had been a loyal Jackson Hewitt customer for over ten years, but after the circus of deception I endured this year, I am going back to H&R BLOCK.
OK! So I go to file my taxes, I entered the business with my brother in law and the receptionist at the front sits us both with one preparer, remind you no other customers are in the facility so every tax preparer was available. The tax preparer started my brother's taxes and half way through they sit me with another tax preparer who was not focused at all, she was hardly looking at me, I felt like I was talking to a wall. Also I don't know if she was distracted by the food signs behind me (McDonald's) (Dunkin' Donuts) but she kept stopping and staring past me until I looked bored enough for her to ask another question. Now I checked their website that they gave me to check the status of my refund and everyday up until today it said the same thing. Today surprisingly it said my check was ready to be picked up so just before I waste my time I call to make sure I can pick up my check and the rep never asked for any info just said "oh nothings here yet" and hang up on me. This is very rude I worked Customer Service all my life that's how I make my money and I know that is not how to treat customers so now according to their website my check is there but according to the rep it is not. They either got they wires crossed, need to get their website fixed or just don't know what they are doing overall. I will not be returning back to them for taxes. This was a horrible first experience and it won't happen again!
Hey guys called the IRS and got some info. First off, do not let JH blame this ** on the IRS. They actually came up w/ a good system. You see every refund will be or should be issued on a Thursday (guess JH didn't get that memo). This is what happens. The IRS sends refunds to banks on Tuesday. Banks get it on Wednesday, banks have 24 hrs to give it to us which would normally be on Thursday. By the way JH I am reporting y'all to the IRS and I agree w/ everyone here. But guys let's stick w/ what we say. Let's tell friends and family about JH and how greedy they are to keep our money a little longer to gain interest. Really JH damn y'all just charged me $500 to do my taxes, my gf $647 to do her taxes. Damn something that only takes 30 min to do, and you can't promise us same day IRS promised us. That's messed up and I hope no one files w/ ya no more. Pray y'all go bankrupt, I hope and pray holding my check a little longer to gain some extra cash you greedy ** you fall on your face JH, wow been w/ y'all 12 years. Anybody know what $1100 x 12 is, that is what me and my gf have paid in 12 years, just fees. Guys please tho don't take this out on IRS. They want to try to make a good name and America like them since we never have and always griping that's why they came up w/ the plan mentioned above. All my friends who had dd going to their accts got their refunds at midnight of the 6th just like the IRS said but if you had used a service and it was going to their bank like JH's bank then you had to actually had to go up to JH to get your refund then you're w/ me not getting it till the 7th which is not what the IRS said. So the IRS is sending me a form to file this complaint against them. Trust me y'all. JH knew what they were doing. Just what are you gonna do about it. Pass it on, file complaint against JH, let the IRS investigate JH. I have them recorded saying IRS hasn't released funds. I said, "Ma'am, then how does my friend have his refund?" Hope this helps...
I went to Jackson Hewitt on Feb. 5, 2014 to get my taxes done. Kevin was great but I left my folder with all of my personal information in it and they did not try to help me locate nor did they try to tell me what I could do about my refund check that I was having direct deposited. Because after I noticed the paperwork was gone, I had to close my checking account and I paid $49 for direct deposit. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND JACKSON HEWITT TO A DYING DOG IN NEED OF HELP!! Their customer service is poor at best and they have no kind of care, concern or empathy. All they care about is getting your money!!! DO NOT USE THEM!!!
I have gotten the run around all day, and every time I call, they said my stuff is complete, but I might have to wait till next week to get my check even though they print it out there. They have the money in their bank. WTH Jackson Hewitt I paid about $400.00 to get the run around. I don't think so, I AM GOING BACK TO H&R BLOCK. I would not use them. No one at all knows anything. They all say something different.
I presented my W2s and I was told they would charge me a $50 less than the other tax service I used last year. When all was done I was charged over $500.00 for the tax service, when I asked why the amount was $500.00, the tax preparer told me because I had 6 W2s and a 1099 and two different state filings, so I asked her if I could see the calculations to view how much each additional fee was that totaled to the amount over $500.00 and she displayed a screen after she took a black cover off the monitor, and said that she could not pull up the calculations, the system wouldn't let her. Shouldn't the coupons the fees for the service be presented up front and the screen made visible?
Last year, we made the mistake and used Jackson Hewitt. The lady was rude when completing them, entered our twins social security numbers vice versa. Then we got audited. We purchased their "guaranteed audit support", and what a joke! We went back and let them know what was happening. She was like "Oh well, just fax the info!" Really??? What about your Gold Star Guarantee? We have faxed the stuff needed to the IRS, but keep getting the run around. Here we are one year later still battling for last year’s refund. Total waste of the 590.00 fee she charged us! We will NEVER use them again. Worst service ever!
I decided to use Jackson Hewitt tax service to file my 2013 taxes this year. I used them 2012 and had a good experience so I went back to the same location (Walmart O'Neal Lane Baton Rouge, La) to utilize JH tax service again this year but had a totally different experience this time. First, I had to wait 1.5 hours along with 10 other people, who some actually left. Because there were so many people I knew that there was going to be a wait but after 1.5 hours not one tax preparer informed the waiting customers on what the hold-up was. I asked one of the tax preparers "how much longer" and was greeted with not sure and that she had not taken a break in 10 hours and that I could leave my tax documents with them. Really??? Who would leave important personal information A. with a stranger, B. in a public place. Last time I checked, W2's contained your name, address, work address, wage information and other information that you would just "leave" with strangers. When they finally called my name, it had been almost 2 hours and the tax preparer greeted me but then he received a phone call which he entertained for approximately for 5 minutes. Not sure if it was business related or not but I thought it was rude. Then informed me that this was a second job for him and that his primary job was as an application engineer, where he was from, and that he had received a "promotion" at his primary job. He did explain that the delay was caused by one of the pc's crashing but I think they should have notified us, "the customers", before that long wait to whether to come back at another time or continue to wait. He "guesstimated" that I would owe based on a "guesstimation" of how much I made. Since I used JH last year he was able to pull some tax information after he could not locate my email address until and told me that he could not find my information at the beginning until I wrote the email address down for him to read from. He saw my tax information and dependents that I claimed from 2012 and when I informed him of changes in claiming certain dependents he began to give his personal view of why if my 18 year old daughter should no longer be allowed to live in my home because I informed him that I supplied majority of her support but would not claim her on my taxes for this year several times as if I was a child and could not comprehend the benefits from adding her to my dependent list. At this point, between him communicating "all about his life experiences" I wondered how he could focus on accurate tax preparation while talking about non-related issues? He 'guesstimated again’ that it wasn't looking too good and that I might owe the government instead of receiving a refund. I am not a tax specialist but I have prepared my own taxes for 10 years utilizing self tax preparation and was no "dummy" to preparing taxes. I realized that almost to the end of him "preparing" my taxes that I did forget to bring an important document for deductions which by this time he told me he had "guesstimated" that my return would be close to $1500.00 and asked me what my returned had been the year before which is strange especially since I had my taxes prepared by JH last year and would assume that it would be right there for him to view. I became very agitated and informed him to stop the process because I wanted to get a document that would assist in possible more credits towards by deduction in which he in turned stated, "I don't want to lose your business." REALLY? He told me he did not want to 'void’ my tax information in the system. I do NOT plan to return to complete taxes and would expect better from Jackson Hewitt!
Well I filed with Jackson Hewitt for the 3rd time and it will be my last. I went in on the 17th of Jan. The Office manager didn't honor what the last Tax preparer said if I filed this year. She said she would knock off a 100 dollars. He only did $25 and I felt uncomfortable the whole time cause he, the Manager, was hitting on me. Tried to give me a hug and he asked me not to go. Gave me his cell number and told me if I wanted to party to call him. I felt So out of place. All I wanted to do is file and that be the end of it.. He also signed me up for this gold warranty thing and he never said it was gonna be a charge... Almost 500 dollars is going to be taken out... I hate them, I will never go back ever. The man that hit up on me shouldn't be working there... I'm Pretty sure other woman were harassed as well. So I gave the office a call (OBT location) AND ASKED FOR ALL MY PAPER WORK BACK AND I DID NOT WANT THEM TO FILE. He then said it was too late and I let him know I was going to corporate for this... Felt so weird having an old man try to give me a hug them hold my hand in a weird way and tell me I'm pretty ewww... I'm very disappointed that I trusted them and my family (mother) has been going through them for years. So Mad that 1 Office Man ruined that for the remaining years that I could have been a loyal customer too... If you Read this just know to not go to the one next to Windixi on OBT especially if you're a woman... Beware the man With the (Spanish man With Gray hair).
I went in to filed my taxes at one of the branches in Rochester downtown area on (Franklin Street). I have filed my taxes with this company two years in a row, I only paid $45.00 for my taxes maybe a little more. I made $21,000 for the year, I have one daughter, my forms are simple I do not own any property. This year I end up owing $427.00 for filing a simple tax form. I was told the fee went up because they changed banks. I don't know anyone that charges that much for a simple tax form. I think I was ripped off. I signed the papers and was told that they would not be processed till that night. When I got home I called another tax preparer to see if I would be able to stop the process, they said yes, If they did not process them yet. I then called the person who originally did the taxes and she told me it was too late, she sent them through as soon as I walked out the door. She lied to me to keep the $427.00 she charged me for filing my taxes. I was also told that she would talk to her manager to see if they could lower the charge. Well I didn't get a call yet. I am upset about this. Next time I will try c.a.s.h. or learn to do my own taxes. I will not be going to Jackson Hewitt on Franklin Street in Rochester again. They are a rip off.
Well I must say I was shocked this year when I went to have my taxes prepared at Jackson Hewitt . They said the only location available at that time was about 45 miles away from where I lived. I was shocked but I assumed it was due to the fact that I always get my W2s earlier than most but I was wrong. They don't have any other locations anywhere near me and I've had to go back 3 times to sign my final state papers because they didn't even have the new paperwork available to be sent to government when they decided to do my taxes and then they only had 1 young woman there to deal with half of Michigan trying to get their taxes done and answer questions etc., etc. and she had already quit once that day but I guess someone begged her to come back. Well, I tried calling to see if they finally had it figured out before making another trip there and they answered the phone by another name!!! I was confused and when I asked if that was Jackson Hewitt she said, "Yeah but they don't go by that name anymore"!! Considering they charged 350 dollars for my easy taxes to be filed you think they would have told me some of this information. It makes me uneasy about dealing with them considering we still haven't been able to sign final papers for the state because the new girl didn't know how to print them out!!! So now I wish I could just take my papers and go somewhere else or just do it myself because that's pretty much what I'm doing with Jackson Hewitt anyhow!!! How would I go about that though when they don't even know how to print the paperwork???
$50 Gift card for switching - I went to the Jackson Hewitt located at 7060 Natural Bridge rd. located in Normandy, Missouri. The lady who handled my preparation didn't offer it to me. She told me that I had to ask for it and that she couldn't give it to me because my file was closed out. I read the sign on the glass and I just got done seeing the commercial and nowhere in the ad said that I had to ask for it. I would like to have my card.
I filed my taxes and was told I was going to get fast 50 on a Smart Card within 1 hour. Here it is 5 hours later and it is still not on the card. I am getting the complete run around and every person I speak with say that they have no idea what is going on. And one lady told named Courtney very rudely told her boss she wished I would stop calling and whining. And her boss laughed it off. While I was on the phone listening to them! This company does not train their employees and they have no accountability for their actions or the lies that they tell people. I needed that $50 to pay for medication for my son so he is stuck out until they can follow through with their word.
I was told that since my husband contributes to TSP he could not also have a tax deductible IRA. This is not true according to the IRS and publication 590. If you are married and filing jointly, depending on your modified adjusted gross income, you can have an IRA that is deductible. Unfortunately, I was told we could not resulting in a larger tax bill, even though we met the income requirements for a partial contribution. Called JH, they would not do anything other than give me a partial credit for my next filing. Since I don't intend to go back there, it was not helpful.
Last year I tried filing my taxes online through Jackson Hewitt. I was unable to complete my taxes. I went to Tax Act and completed my taxes just fine. On January 21st 2013 Jackson Hewitt debited my bank account for $56.90 twice for the total of $113.80. I have been trying to get my money back for over a year. I finally got a live person on the phone today at 1(800)234-1040 and clearly English was not her first language. She was no help, so I asked for her supervisor who was no help and very rude also. She told me to go back to the website that charged me to file the complaint, which makes no sense being that is where my problems started. I tried going to my local Jackson Hewitt, which by the way has no connection when it comes to customer support. I feel my money should be refunded with interest. I work in customer service, and I have to say Jackson Hewitt has the worst customer service I have ever seen. My next step which I should have done a year ago is contact the Better Business Bureau and the Attorney General. P.S. I tried the phone number on my bank statement listed below, and it does not belong to Jackson Hewitt.
I do my taxes with Jackson Hewitt every year for past 4 years. The last couple years they don't help you out with any up front money. They told me, "Oh, there's these people we are working with who does no credit check who gives $1500 loans." **, they denied me because of my credit. This is the last year I will be doing service with Jackson Hewitt ...
On September 28, 20013, I registered for an online tax course with Jackson-Hewitt. On October 7th, the first day of the class, I tried to begin the modules but my account showed that I wasn't enrolled in any classes. After a series of emails back and forth between me and the instructor, where she kept telling me to try back later, I was told that a Melissa would be in touch with me. At 3 pm that day, Melissa called me. She asked me to log out and log back in, and when I said the site showed still that I was not enrolled in any courses, she told me to give her my username and password. I responded that I would change my password quickly and give that new password to her. At that point, she yelled at me, saying she is both the head of HR and the manager and that she didn't have time to deal with me, as she oversees many people. I said that I use that same password for many accounts and was not comfortable giving that to anybody else. She told me that since she was the head of HR, she was going to mark my account with a note about my bad attitude and keep that in mind if I ever apply for a job with Jackson-Hewitt. I responded that I would not be applying for a job with this company, which was met with more yelling about why I had even enrolled in the course. After more yelling and bullying, I asked her to stop yelling and said that I was frustrated because she was telling me how she didn't even have time for me, to which she denied as she yelled some more. I asked for a refund several times, but I was ignored as she continued to yell over me and then she actually hung up on me. She did call me back later, saying, "Now that we've both had some time to calm down, we can talk." I'd like to point out that I was even toned on the phone the entire time with her, the only person yelling or being rude was Melissa. I asked for a refund again and was told that she would look into it and get back to me. Neither she, nor any other representative of the company, has gotten back to me about the refund. Attempting to log in again after the last phone call with Melissa showed that my account has been disabled. At this point, it's only fair and reasonable that I should be refunded for the course that I never had access to. I did contact Jackson Hewitt's corporate office with my request for a refund, but was told that they could only submit an incident report to the local office, which would be sent within 7 days and that I might then hear back from that local office. For reference, that number is Incident Report **. I called back today and was told by their representative that Staci **, CCO Area Manager, had left a message for me so the case was closed. Today is now October 16th and no refund has been issued by Jackson-Hewitt.
I'm a single mother of one. I work part time as well as have a small online shop at Etsy. I had been separated from my ex for more than half the year. The lady at JH at first refused to do my tax return because she didn't like my documentation of my online business. She actually said that for all she knew it could be made up income, because people do that to get the EIC. I'm honest. I report all my income even though many people tell me to "use the system" but that’s not my style! She told me I could NOT file as head of household. In the end, I ended up owing over $300 (which is more than a week’s pay to me!) to IRS, and she wanted almost $500 for doing my taxes in the 20 minutes (my whole gross income for the year was less than $20,000). When I told her I don't have that kind of money she managed to "find codes/coupons" to apply and got it down to just under $200.
After working for a local franchise for 6 years, and being called back every year, I was, as usual, asked to come back once again. After being approved and receiving all work assigned to start earning my CE credits and Jackson Hewitt requirements, the new Federal law about same sex marriage came out. I expressed my concern stating that I wasn't sure I could file same sex marriages as "married", and asked if there were some way I could opt out and allow someone else to file those returns. I was given a very judgmental response, stating that I was being judgmental on my views and that it was the same as being racist against mixed marriages. I stated that this was not the case, biblically, and that they "can't have this in our offices". They waited quite a few weeks before getting back to me with their "final" answer as to whether they would allow me to come back knowing I have this view (since of course, I apparently am not allowed to have a view against homosexual marriage as being recognized as marriage). In the meantime, I submitted a test and request to work for a local competitor, who gave me a much nicer response to my request to quietly decline filing same-sex marriage returns and giving them to someone else without showing any prejudice. They actually stated they would work with it and would allow me to gently decline (or at least not judge me and say I'm being judgmental and racist). Wasn't Jackson Hewitt's response towards me being judgmental? And to say I'm being prejudice because of my anti-homosexual stance? I was basically told that I was not asked to come back (even after I was indeed asked to come back). Wow, they are so concerned about their money coming into their already slow offices, that they would remove a good-standing tax preparer because they are "worried" about what I would say, do, or the views I have expressed. Sounds judgmental towards me, and not the other way around. Seems that in order to keep your tax preparation job with Jackson Hewitt, you have to be willing to compromise your conviction, shut up and just do the return as the customer wishes...period, even if it doesn't sit well biblically or morally. It's bad enough that for the past 6 years, the clients that walk in their doors to get taxes done are making up figures on their business expenses and car mileage, adding kids that aren't theirs, trying to file an incorrect filing status, and preparers are frowned upon for being too much of a tax police. Thanks, but no thanks. I'll go work for your competitor who not only has a higher ethical standard, but isn't quite as worried about bringing in the money that they would allow customers to make up figures, add kids, and even use an incorrect filing status. All to make the customer happy. Thanks for the tax knowledge and few extra dollars and some great people to work with, but no thanks for the unethical way of treating your employees by asking them not to come back due to their conviction against filing a same-sex couple return.
I retired in 2010 and began receiving my Social Security. Circumstances shortly afterwards made it necessary to go back to work for 2 years. For the filing years of 2011 and 2012, I had my taxes done by Jackson Hewitt. At my first appointment for the 2011 filing, I specifically asked the lady doing my taxes if my Social Security Income needed to be reported. The response was, "No, I don't even want to see it." This was the same for 2012 - same lady. A few weeks ago, I get a notice from the IRS stating that I owe over $4000 for not reporting my S.S. Income for 2011. My wife did a simple Google search and in less than 2 minutes discovered on the SSA website that income over $25000 Social Security Income must be reported. I contacted the IRS and they were nice enough to give me 30 extra days to sort out this error with Jackson Hewitt, but it doesn't matter. JH's attitude is basically, "oh well, guess you owe the IRS" and contact them when you hear from them about the 2012 filing. Why? They're not doing anything at all for 2011. I and my wife live on our boat and am presently on our dream cruise to the islands in the Caribbean. In a couple of years I will be 70 years old and my social security is our only income. Now, I have to go back to our home state and attempt to find a job at my age to pay the IRS for a mistake that was made TWICE by Jackson Hewitt. I will probably be paying this for the rest of my life. My dream is gone now. Because they didn't know even the simplest laws concerning income, they have ruined my life...
2011 Jackson Hewitt filed my taxes, I received my refund, and was all happy. I filed 2012 online. IRS website kept telling me return being processed. Still no refund 6 weeks later. I called IRS, and was told that I owed 9800.00 from 2011. That I could not claim 2 dependents. They were my step grandchildren. I was never received any notice from IRS. They told me all letter were returned undelivered because of address on return was incomplete. I looked back on my copies of return filed by Jackson Hewitt. They put just PO Box. Miramar Beach, FL. They failed to put in a box number. All my W-2 had my correct address with the PO Box Number. I have to pay penalties and interest of $2335.86 due to their error in filing out form correct. I have called several times, asking how to file a claim as I did purchase the gold plan. Can get a reply, just the runaround. They should be responsible for this part of the amount I have to pay back. I plan to seek a attorney advice.
It's July 3, 2013 and I just received my tax return! I had checked on their website as well as the IRS website. Every time I checked, it said it was still being processed. I called the IRS to see what was going on and was informed that my refund had been sent to Jackson Hewitt the first week of March, even though we had it set up as direct deposit. So I checked may tax records to see if the account numbers were right. They were. I proceeded to call the Clearfield branch to find out what had happened. The gentleman who answered told me that according to their records, the check had been picked up and deposited into my account on March 8. But he would look into it further and call me back in a few days (call took place on June 3rd). As Monday came around, I still hadn't heard anything and was getting antsy (who wouldn't after hearing their refund had already been deposited?). So on Monday, I went to the Clearfield branch (1-6PM according to this site and Jackson Hewitt's) and nobody was there. I tried calling and and got no answer, so I left a message and proceeded to call their main company to file a formal complaint. I received what I would consider a belligerent phone call the next day from the same gentleman from the Clearfield branch for filling the formal complaint. I was told I could pick up my refund on July 3rd (the following day). I arrived at the office and informed them that I would also like a refund. The gentleman told that he would not do that, but would give me 50% off of next year's taxes because they had attempted to contact me twice, but after those two attempts had not tried again. I was not thrilled with going through this company again and suggested once more that I wanted a refund. He once again refused. Take from this what you want, but I for one would suggest going elsewhere to have your taxes done.
In March 2013, I had my taxes done by JH. I have used them for several years. I received my federal refund check within two weeks. On around the first of June, I went online to find out where my state refund was and the funds had been released to the company on April 9th. I called and the woman I spoke with said she would print the check and mail it out the next day - that was a Friday. I waited until the following Friday and called again. A man told me it had been mailed and that the woman would call me on Monday. She never called. Tuesday, I called her and she said she was calling about it now and she would call me back. She did and said she would have the funds and print the check in an hour and overnight it to me. Wednesday, I did not receive the check but had received a call from the man again wanting to meet me. I called him back at 8:30 at night, and he thought I would be thrilled to hear they finally had my check ready and he wanted to meet me instead of overnight mail. I refused and told him the check better be here by Friday. It was.
The IRS "Where's my refund" indicated my refund was to be deposited on April 17th to my bank or institution. As Jackson Hewitt was responsible for receiving my funds to issue me a check, they were my bank. On April 17th I called Jackson Hewitt to see if my check was ready. The operator on the phone told me my check had not been printed yet and to hold on the line while she would call the location to see if I could come and pick it up. As she came back on the line, she said she spoke to the manager. He said the check had not been processed yet and will not be ready until tomorrow. She suggested she would call the general manager instead (her idea as I could hear in her voice she felt this was unacceptable as well)! She took my name and number and said she would call me back. 45 minutes went by and I did not hear from her so I called. I asked her what the general manager said and she told me he said I could not come and get the check as it had already been mailed out! In summary: From the time I called to the end of the conversation with the operator was only one hour. From not being processed to already getting mailed out is a flat out lie. This is really poor customer service and ridiculous that I cannot get my funds the day they were ready. I will never do business with Jackson Hewitt ever again!
I filed with Jackson Hewitt this year and worked in two different states. I took all W-2s into the office and sat for an hour whole. The preparer did her work. I signed papers and was on my way out the door. Refund was close to $7000. She told me it was because of the child tax credit and my two kids. I got the refund check and one out of two state checks. I received a call from a woman who is over all of the Omaha offices. She came off very rude and told me that my taxes were done wrong and that I needed to come in and sign an amendment and that I owe about $2300 back because my wages were entered twice. The preparer was supposed to enter in Iowa and Nebraska but she just entered it in twice, so she doubled my 2012 gross. So I went into the office and requested copies of the amendment. Why should I trust them again to file anything? The numbers were way different; it said I owed $3200 federal and $300 state. I was told it was their fault and if anything, the IRS should have caught it. There were a lot of excuses but no offer to help, because I didn't purchase the gold guarantee when I was told the coverage that came with the initial payment that the accuracy guarantee was enough. It is hard to get anyone on the phone in any corporate office. I don't even know if a corporate office exists. I want to sue. How can a person pay for a service and then be totally responsible for the mistakes made? Where do I start with a complaint?
I do our taxes, but I needed to do my mother's (94-year-old) and thought it would be best to have someone else do her taxes. First of all, it was $195.00 for less than 15 minutes in JH office and just two forms. What irritates me the most is that two weeks later, I received a notice from the IRS that the information was not complete. When I went to JH, only one person was there. Three weeks before April 15 and she informed me that she couldn't help me. I would have to call and go online to complete it. I should have done it myself. What a waste of time and money.
My 2012 taxes were completed and show I owed almost $3,000 for State and Federal. H&R Block had an ad stating that they would review your taxes for free. They completed my taxes showing that I only have to pay a net $215. Boy, what a difference! I went into a local Jackson Hewitt over a week ago to see if they would refund the tax prep fee. I was sent to another office and that man got up and walked away from me. I called the corp. office a week ago to complain, and I still haven't heard from them.
I went to Jackson Hewitt last year to have my taxes completed and everything was fine. This year, I wasn't planning on going to Jackson Hewitt to have my taxes done, because I had someone who was going to charge me $250 to complete my taxes for me. But I received a call from Jackson Hewitt and an email telling me that they would complete my taxes for $99.00, and this deal was good for the month of March 2013. What a deal, right? And since they completed my taxes last year 2011, they knew everything about for 2012 except my pay for last year. Well, this was not a good deal. What they did not tell me and anyone else they called with this lie was that if you have dividends, then you would have to pay the regular price of $397.00. That's $300 more than they quoted me on the phone. The lady who completed my taxes never bothered to discuss any of this information with me before completing my taxes. Once my taxes were completed, I was informed that my bill was $397.00. At that time, I explained that I was quoted a price of $99.00 - what happened? That is when I was told that does not apply to anyone who filed with dividends. What the hell does that have to do with the price I was quoted? I know anyone can image the anger I was feeling at that time. At the time I was ready to beat the living hell out of the women. But being a lady, I decided to count to 20 (not 10), paid the bill, and told her how I felt about the lie to get me into Jackson Hewitt and a few other things all without cussing and to erase my number from their calling list. Please be aware of Jackson Hewitt. If you go there to have your taxes completed, please ask first how much this will cost you and make them stick to that price.
My wife and I went in to the Jackson Hewitt office in Oviedo, Florida. We used them last year and they were pretty good. When we walked in, we were asked to fill out some new forms that the IRS needed for this year's filing. Being a retired professional, I read them over quickly and the questions they asked were more than the police would ask you in an interview. They asked other than the normal name and address. They asked for our driver's license numbers, how many children and where were they born, did my wife have normal childbirth, were they on any kind of assistance, how many different states did my wife and I work in our lives, etc. My wife and I are 59 and 58. Our children are long grown, gone and married with children of their own. I at first refused to sign. They said I could not file my taxes without these forms. Most of them I left blank and just signed. I called the IRS and they said they never heard of any forms like this and that using their name could be a criminal act. I would never use a Jackson Hewitt again and I will take this further.
AARP tax assistance was unavailable to me this year. So I ended up at a Jackson Hewitt office locally here in Illinois. I live on fixed income, and in past years never owed anything to the IRS given my income. After being interviewed, it was determined by Jackson Hewitt that I didn't owe any taxes again this year and there was no need to even file a return. Once again, the fee for Jackson Hewitt service was never indicated at the onset and I was left having to pay $140 for not even having to file a return. I intend to follow up with their corporate office as this seems a rather expensive charge given the time and work involved to tell a senior they aren't obligated to even file a return. Needless to say, I won't be recommending Jackson Hewitt to anyone and won't be using them again regardless. It's just outrageous and a warning to all considering them for your tax preparation.
My regular CPA (whom I filed taxes with since 2004) sent out letters that he was retiring over this past year. When I was a college student, I usually only paid about 25 dollars to file, and once I was out of school, I paid 75 dollars. He usually always managed to get me $1000 back, $2000 when I was a student. So I had to find another place to file my taxes, so I went into a local Jackson Hewitt office in Somerset, KY. The ladies were very helpful and very good at what they did. However, they did not tell me upfront what the cost of filing with them would be. If they had, I would've walked out. After going through all of the steps in their computer system, and finding as many things to claim, my total came to 271 dollars! They didn't really get me any more back, I'm still getting around 1000 dollars, and they just got a quarter of it. I then opted to pay them with my refund until I found out that the bank that processes the payment charges a 50 dollar fee, making it $321 that I would be out. So, I wrote them a check instead. This is insane, my last guy charged less than 10% of my refund and these crooks charged 25%! I will do my own taxes long before I ever let this happen to me again. I do not want any kind of coverage such as the Gold Plan, I do not want a shopping card, I do not want any other gimmicks. I want my taxes filed with as many legitimate deductions as possible, to pay a fair price for the trouble, and to wait for my refunds to come in. That's how I've done it the past nine years. The lady was very nice and helpful, and she even used a coupon to lower my payment. But here's another prank they pulled; the coupon was for 30 dollars, but they added another 10 dollar data storage fee onto the total, ex post facto, which made the net discount 20 dollars from the coupon. As nice and helpful as the ladies were, it still does not justify 251 dollars to file one W2 form along with my deductions. I will never be back.
I had my 2013 taxes done with the Jackson Hewitt in Fond du Lac, WI. It was the worst place I could have chosen. They messed up right from the start. I called and complained to the owner, Todd, I don't have a last name. He stated he would give us half of our preparation fees back to us. So we waited a week and called Todd and he stated that it would be coming. Still nothing came so I finally got in contact with him again and he gave me the runaround, and I stated I would never use their services again and he hung up on me. I then called again today and he now changed his story that they don't give refunds and said, "What are you going to do about it?" and hung up on me again. This Todd owns five Jackson Hewitts and what kind of way is that for any person to be. I will never use or recommend them to anybody, ever.
I've filed my taxes with Jackson Hewitt for the past 18 years. I called over to the office at 9225 Jensen Dr Houston, TX 77093. The young lady who answered the phone was very rude. That was enough to end our business relationship right there. Thanks to Jackson Hewitt, H&R Block has a new customer.
My daughter went to have her taxes done - 20, works part-time, goes to school part-time. She used 1040EZ - no itemizing. She was asked if she wanted to have their fee deducted from the refund and she said, "Okay". Also, she was asked how much she paid for having taxes done last year (H&R Block, $40). They would not give her the $50 discount because she only paid $40 last year. She got home and I looked at the paperwork and was shocked to see that she was going to be charged over $115 for having her taxes done. We will never use Jackson Hewitt again and we will never recommend them to anyone - she's going back to H&R Block next year. I have my taxes done, itemized, and I am only charged $120 from my accountant.
I cannot believe it, my brother went in to have his taxes done for 35 dollars and came back with a bill for $285! What happened? Hidden charges kept coming up and since he is blind and cannot read, they read it for him. He says they kept telling him you need this, just a little more...for us to file... $285. Rip off. And for all of you who also got ripped off with a bait and switch price, please complain to your state office of consumer affairs. Don't let this company keep jerking people around, stealing your money.
I am very unhappy with the services from Jackson Hewitt at the Walmart location in Sterling Heights. I always had my taxes done at H&R Block and deeply regret not going there this year. I was charged double, almost triple, and was not given my $50 for switching to Jackson Hewitt that is advertised! Also, they charge to do federal and state separate. I was not aware of this and all the hidden charges. I tried to go pick up my check during normal hours and the only person working decided to take a half hour break! There was no one else to help me. I finally got my check. The woman was supposed to put the number to call state and never did, so I called her and she said, "Oh, I will write that down and you can come and get it." What? She refused to give it to me because she was busy! I am very upset with the way I was treated and all the money that was taken from me. I will not refer a friend. I have warned many people. I am writing this to save anyone from not getting all their money they deserve!
I filed my taxes this year the same day my mom did somewhere else. A week later, she had her state taxes and federal back. After two weeks, I called my state who states they haven't received my return yet and my federal says it's in review. I called Jackson Hewitt and they state that my state was held up because my federal had education in it. I argued with them that my state shouldn't be held up because of federal. It's surprising that the next day, it showed that both federal and state had just been received. All in all, I was told that they were sent a week earlier. Then I was told they just started accepting them on the 14th though, in fact, they started accepting on the 10th. I believe they just forgot to send them. Also, I was told that taxes leave that office to their main office to the corporate office, then are reviewed and finally are sent to the appropriate tax entities. I will never use them again.
In 2010, I filed my tax return with Jackson Hewitt and I took in all my info needed to file. The JH employee must have been new, but when she prepared my taxes, she did not enter all my earnings. I got a good refund that year, and in late December of 2012, I got a letter from the IRS stating I was overpaid $1,300. My EDD income and Gambling winnings were not entered when she prepared my taxes, causing an over payment. I called the office in Dec. 2012 and was told to wait when I file 2012 taxes - it will all be taken care of. This was told to me by the regional manager. So when I received all my form to file my taxes, I went into the same office who filed my previous taxes. I had them prepare my taxes and was charged $300, and knowing they messed up my taxes in 2010, I purchased the Gold Package Insurance. So once I was done, I brought up the issue and showed the letters from the IRS and brought in my 2010 tax file. All was intact, and sure enough, the young girl who prepared them did not enter the correct information. So this young lady named Louise contacted the regional manager Lisa and explained to her the accuracy error by the JH employee. Louise then tells me Lisa told her to tell me not to worry and they will pay for all the charges and any penalties and interest, which has grown. An appointment was scheduled for me at the main office in Fresno, CA. I go to my appointment the following week to meet with a Donna with all my letters from the IRS and 2010 tax returns. And what was I greeted with? Nothing but rudeness and a close-minded person who already made up her mind, and to cover up the mistake the JH employee did, stated to me, "Since you did not purchase the insurance, I can't help you." I was so upset especially knowing this was a JH error, not mine. I stormed out of the office and called the Corporate office where again I have been given the runaround. So in other words, according to Jackson Hewitt, they don't guarantee accuracy but will try to sell you insurance just in case they don't know what they’re doing (like the young lady in my case). I refuse to return to this company. Bad way to do business!
I had worked my job for 5 months and got unemployment, which I paid taxes on. I was told that it couldn't be filed as a basic tax return because of the unemployment, and they charged me $58. But if I owned a business, it would be less charge to prepare taxes. I don't own a home and have no dependents. It’s so unfair. Rip offs!
What a pain! I called to find a place in my town. I told the guy I live in Tomah. I said, "Is there any place close that has an opening?" He said, "Yes, one on Prairie St." I was thinking that street doesn't sound like one in my town. I said several times, "in Tomah?" He said yes so I said, "Are you sure?" He said, "Let me check," and said, "Beloit." I said, "Really?! Do you know how far that is?" and, "That doesn't sound like Tomah..." I hate having to say the same thing over and over and still it isn't understood. I called several times before I got a call back. Nobody knows what is going on, even the bosses. I asked why they have the words stamped across the front reference copy, "do not file" and if I could have a copy of my tax return without the words on it? Then I had to ask them several times and the response was, "I will have to get back to you; I don't know if we can do that." So I am waiting still. I will never go back to them nor will I ever tell anybody to go to them.
Here is some free tax advice for everyone out there: (1) Don't go to Jackson Hewitt, they are crooked and thieves; (2) Make sure you ask the company you file with if there are any unknown charges (for example: A charge of $80.00 to get your W-2 back because you decide to go somewhere else for an opinion; this is because they want to charge $458.00 upfront to turn in your taxes, and all because they added on extra forms that were not requested); (3) Make sure you carefully watch what is being added to your form and ask questions if you don't understand something because they will take advantage of you if given the chance. Save yourself the irritation and frustration! Don’t use Jackson Hewitt because they are lying crooks. If they will treat veterans like this, imagine how they will treat everyone else.
So my husband and I had our taxes done. They never did the state but decided to charge $200 for the federal. I was so pissed I wanted then to cancel the refund. They said no because it was already sent. I called the 800 number; they said, "No problem, they will cancel the refund." I got a call back later that night and the guy told me that there was nothing they could do because it was sent. Not only did they not file the state, but they took half of the federal. So now, we are only getting $200 back. What the hell? People, did no one train people that work for this company? What's going on? Are they just scamming people to get money in their pockets? I thought I was the only one, but then I found out they have been doing this for awhile all over the USA.
I went to JH two days ago because my daughter told me they were great. I went and only had to file a 1099 on my unemployment income for 2012. I couldn't believe when I found out all I was getting for state was $1.15. They took the rest ($2.35) for them to file my taxes. Is this right and can I stop it? Please help me. I want someone to do them but it was efiled. Am I screwed because they already sent them? Thanks.
I have been working for Jackson Hewitt for 3 years. In my first year, I was trained in the head office by a manager who was there for a long time. At the time, I was handed tax returns to complete that entailed Schedule C's for very high income and was given a last year return for this individual and told to follow the numbers. As it was my first year, I was unaware of the importance of Schedule C's. In my second year, I learned a little more for I was let go but then asked to be manager at one of their locations that had a compliance issue with a manager who was doing anything for the company to keep her job. This company preyed on people and abused the tpin numbers of their employees, because they knew they would carry the bulk of the responsibilities. As a manager for that short period, I had seen first hand how they went about their business practices and it was ugly. I also discovered that prior to hiring me, they hired an individual who had the same first and last name as mine and when they hired me, she just disappeared and no longer worked with the company. They also threatened to fire you if you don't do whatever it takes to keep a client even if it means earning a red flag. Like city employees claiming miles when they work at a desk all day, I am also being underpaid. What can I do to move forward?
I tried to get my payroll card activated. I called the 800 number and all I get is ignorance from the customer service, as the person who gave me my payroll card told me to give it one day to activate it. Well I'm waiting. So inconsiderate of your management. I would like to get paid too like the other employees.
I went to Jackson Hewitt to get my taxes done for the year 2011. After waiting in line, I sat with a woman who talked on her phone more than she talked to me. I reviewed my paperwork and was on my way. After 3 months of waiting for my return, I called the state office and they said they had no record of my returns. I called the customer service department, and they said they would re-submit the paperwork. Another month went by and still no return. I ended up having to do the state return myself. It was a nightmare. I will not use the company ever again nor would I recommend it to anyone else!
I was attending school with JH. When I filled out the application with them, I only had one contact number on file with them. We went on a break for 2 weeks. Lisa and Jason said they called me for a week. I never answered so they fired me, but they never responded to me when I asked what was the number they called. I believe it was discrimination. I was the only black employee. Should I file wrongful termination suit?
JH are liars and do not protect your information. I went to JH. I was told the fee would be less than four hundred. I’ve been a client for years. When my taxes were done, I was told five hundred, I refused. I was then told four. Also, the new owners could give me an accounting for fees not happening. I was also told that I owed four plus hundred for 2009. I said I paid and refused payment. Note that the new owners did my taxes in 2010. They were rude and not pleasant. I did receive my taxes and all information on another client they have, name, address, SS, and date of birth, all freely given to me by Jackson Hewitt. I contacted the person and took their most private info to them. Now, I wonder how protected my stuff is with JH Putty Hill, MD.
Merging of individual's name and other unexplained matters - Please note I would like to understand why I was not informed of the class action suit if that firm involved pulled all application or reviewed the following. I would like to note I have been a victim of unexplainable transaction from the first application I have ever filed with Jackson Hewitt, very unaware that this incorporation is more like a franchise like Gino's or McDonald's and different personal owners which was never publicized nor mentioned. I'm unaware if the data system is divided by different banks or other financial institutions. I had questioned some of my rapid refunds due to the various interest rates depending on who is doing your paperwork. The other matter came into question as on more than one occasion I was given another alleged client check and information with a similar name who have filed at all the same locations I have filed. As I was about to proceed to sign for an alleged refund that I assumed was mine but, yet on review of the last four digits of the Social Security number, I told them that it was not me. Yet, my refund on some occasions was never given to me for some reason and this matter has brought me under different tax auditing when it might or should have been maybe the other party. Yet, I have filed for the Christmas bonus where I was allowed a minimum of $500. And when tax time came around, I had paid back more than the loan at some point. I was never aware of the form that was used for this process yet, always questioned the matter of the other person not being so thoughtful if presented my income refunds which I believe happened on more than one occasion due to a refund of over $4000 never being explained. I have always filed in the Philadelphia location. I do not know the owner of this chain franchise. Please note my taxes for some reason is all discombobulated and I had dealt with only Jackson Hewitt fearing if I went anywhere else, I would cause a disaster which I believe happened from the start. I have been having problem with this alleged person named **, filed a refund with Jackson Hewitt for the 2005 refund that would payout a check for 2006. Please note I would like to understand how this could happen. Just like the person who tried to get me to sign this person's check might be the same one who let this individual file my return. Please assist, it's a big scam or conspiracy criminally. I never filed and had to pay some type of levy on the matter. Yes, and Jackson Hewitt was the preparer and I was not the receiver; it was intercepted. Please, I would like to know via e-mail if an attorney filed it or an individual. Money has continued to be removed from me because of all this misleading transaction and falsification of information. I have been terminated from my employment since November 2005 and have not held one "job" since that time, not even in 2009, so please assist! Jackson Hewitt has never refunded all I was entitled yet messed me up with this IRS mess.
Jackson Hewitt have been completing my taxes for approximately 25+ years. Until this year, I had been completely satisfied with them. I attempted numerous times to contact the district manager with him repeating the same thing over and over again like we never had discussed my concern. Finally, I requested a call from his boss. It took over two weeks to get a return call. I had surgery in 2010 and was forwarded some documentations from Metlife (short term disability information) that states important tax information. So when I requested my taxes to be completed, I gave this to the Jackson Hewitt representative. She handed it back stating she did not need it. I did question her and she stated she was told that the docs were not required when filing a few months ago. Now 2012, I received a notice from the IRS stating I owed $700.00. I immediately knew what it was for and took it to another open location. I was told since I did not purchase their gold package and just had basic coverage, they would only cover interest and penalties. My complaint is basically, if I hand the Jackson Hewitt's representative documents that state "important tax information enclosed" and he/she hands it back after viewing it, stating it was not needed, why would I feel great about the funds already paid to them in 2010 to complete service and 2 years later, be okay paying the IRS for their negligence? I requested them to provide this service in good faith to be completed honestly and correctly. I explained to the regional manager that even if I am not compensated in full, I believe they should do something. He stated he was not going to and all he was going to do is give me $28.00 for penalties and interest due to error made, which is the basic coverage. As of today, I have not received penalties and interest amount either.
My fiancé and I have been together for three years and she has three children. She has been going to school and didn't work all year. We went to Jackson Hewitt to ask if I could claim children even if I'm not their biological father and were not married. We were told we could as long as I supported them from 12-31 to 12-21 of that calendar year. Being I do not have children, I was very trusting in what the so called tax professional told me. She labeled as the kids father after I told her numerous times I'm not their father. So we received our return and when I was made aware of this wrong doing, I went to Jackson Hewitt and spoke to the area manager. She said I was not allowed to have claimed them as my kids and said I would have to amend my return and so I did know I have to pay back what I received but told me that the lady would lose her job. I'm taking care of 4 people and I only make $9.50 an hour. Now, I have to pay back $7000+. Why am I the one to be made a crook when I went to them because they are the professionals? I mean if I knowingly wanted to rip off the government, I could have filed a lie myself. Please help me.
On January 31, 2010, I paid Mr. John ** $150.00 to have my taxes for the year 2009, filed electronically. I was due a refund from the state in the amount of $285.00, which I never received. On February 7, 2012, I received a letter from NYS Department of Taxation and Finance saying they never received my income tax return for the year 2009. I immediately contacted John ** to confirm that he filed them. Mr. ** had a problem finding my papers and advised me to sign another form that would be acceptable to the Department of Finance. Mr. ** said, "don't worry, I know my way around the department because I'm an ex-employee for the IRS". After signing and sending the documents back to the Department of Taxation, they sent me a letter with explanation and reducing the amount of the refund to $100.00 because one of the dependents I used on my taxes for that year did not qualify any longer. A new filing date was issued for March 28, 2012 as if my taxes had never been filed. Since this time, Mr. ** has not been very cooperative, said he's working on it but does not return my calls, forcing me to show up to his place of business. Department of Taxation said that Jackson Hewitt must provide a copy of the confirmation email that was sent out verifying Jackson Hewitt's transmission was received. Jackson Hewitt does not have this document to provide. Jackson Hewitt does not want to pay the $285.00 + interest since 2009, + $150.00 I paid them to do my taxes nor do they want to honor the Gold Guarantee certificate that was issued at the time I paid for the preparation. Any assistance on this matter would be appreciated. Thank you, God bless you and Amen.
My mother passed away on March 20, 2012. I went to JH to file her taxes for 2011. I wasn't comfortable doing her taxes. She had several 1099's and I am not familiar with filing those forms. It took several days and several phone calls to get everything together. I paid $400 for their terrible service including filing electronically so I could get the refund faster. That was April 17, 2012. Yes, I had taken it to them before the 15th. Here it is May 21, 2012; got a letter from the IRS. JH didn't file the correct forms and now I have to get it together in order to receive a refund in hopefully 6 to 8 weeks. I find myself waiting for the other shoe to drop here in Indiana. I'm sure it was not filed correctly either. Wish I had read this before I went to JH.
I filed my taxes in Niles, MI with Jackson Hewitt. They made errors on my taxes and still to this day, no Jackson Hewitt staff at the office or corporate knows anything. They were supposed to re-file and fix the errors they made and send it back into MI. I just found out that MI has nothing. So, I paid Jackson Hewitt $510.64 and my taxes were not completely filed and were filed with errors and now I cannot get any answers about where my refund is or if corporate even re-filed my state taxes!
A couple came to me for advice and assistance. A Jackson Hewitt office had filed their taxes and the IRS has since notified the couple their return was in error and more than $1,000 was owed to the IRS. That Jackson Hewitt office is closed with no forwarding address. Another Jackson Hewitt office offered no assistance and said they were not surprised the couple was having problems. Beware, my advice is to go to a year around established office that does not offer gimmicks and does not get paid by the amount of your tax refund.
I went to the Jackson Hewitt at Wal-Mart by my house. I would like to tell you my taxes were done right, but I can't. I was way overcharged, and they did everything in the book wrong on my taxes. They put that I was single, and I happen to be married. The guy said I could not claim the interest on my home in Texas, but I found out I can. This man made up numbers. There was not one thing that was right on it. Well, to make a long story short, I went to H&R Block to get it fixed; and a woman who worked there corrected it. I am getting an extra $2400.00. The nice woman at H&R Block told me to get my money back, but the owner refused to give my money back, even though they did it all wrong. I think the people who work at that location and the owner are very rude and do not care about their customers. Did I also mention I am disabled .
I am writing this review to warn people about the nightmare that is Jackson Hewitt. We recently used Jackson Hewitt Tax Services to prepare our taxes and electronic file our joint return. The experience was absolutely terrible and is still ongoing. We e-filed through this office on March 10 and were told our refund would be direct deposited by March 30. To date, we have not received our refund. When I called Jackson Hewitt to ask about the situation, they stated they couldn't help us because we were signed up to get direct deposit and gave me several different IRS hotlines to try. Needless to say, after finally getting through to the IRS (after being on hold for at least an hour), they tell me that they never received our return from Jackson Hewitt and that we need to send in paper copies of everything! We contacted Jackson Hewitt after receiving this news and they were unable to accommodate us in anyway. They also refused to issue us any kind of refund for the $200+ we paid them to prepare our taxes and just blindly claimed that they submitted our return and basically pushed us back out the door. The customer service at Jackson Hewitt is horrifying and I strongly recommend that you do not use them. I have tried other tax services in the past (Liberty Tax Service) and have never had this kind of issue. The tax preparers at Jackson Hewitt are not educated in tax law. They simply use the same basic software that anyone can access at home similar to a Turbo Tax product. The specific woman that prepared our taxes could not answer most of our questions and had to keep calling the Main Office. It was very frustrating to say the least. We would have gotten up mid-session; however, Jackson Hewitt will charge you a sitting fee. Another fee, no big surprise there from the rip-off that is Jackson Hewitt!
I went to a local Wal-Mart in order to get my taxes completed by a Jackson Hewitt rep. I only had to wait 20 minutes. While I was in the middle of consulting with the rep, another customer arrived to get their taxes. The rep asked me if I was in a hurry and I responded yes. She then asked the other customer to wait a few minutes and then she would take care of her. I thought the rep was going to complete my return while I was there, but then I was told it would be the next day before they were completed. I had to call for 2 days before the rep said they were ready. Then, I was told the cost was $225 when I thought it would be a lot less. I was not happy at all, especially when I found out I owed over $1600 in federal taxes. I will never use Jackson Hewitt again.
My husband, David, and I went to a Jackson Hewitt location in Lancaster, SC which was set up at the local Wal-Mart. There was a large sign which stated that they would charge 50% less to file our taxes this year than we paid last year. We were charged $100 last year, so according to basic math, we should have been charged $50 for the services. We filed the short form and it took a very long time as the employee seemed clueless and hung over. We had to pay $240 for them to be filed. That's $190 over the promised price. The consequences were that on our limited income, no money was left to buy groceries. I'm hungry now for my refund from the company. I have yet to have the opportunity to speak with anyone about this. There isn't even that option when I called the Dillon office to speak to anyone about this. The only option offered was to leave a message. I am determined and will follow through with this until we receive the money they took from us.
Since 2-8-2012, my local office owner has given me this song and dance that he doesn't know why my return isn't here yet. In mid-February, his office admitted not filing my return correctly but now, I am being charged excessive interest rates for my RAL. On 4-20-2012, I was told by this same owner to "** off, I don't care about your taxes!" Really, is this how you conduct business? No federal tax return to date.
Word of advice: always look at your taxes after you do them. I didn't and I could have been in big trouble if I was audited. I went to Jackson Hewitt out at Wal-Mart in January to have my taxes done and the lady said file married but file separate. She got me for $290.00 with the gold plan. Renae took hers up to H&R Block yesterday and the lady said there is a big mistake on mine when Renae also took my taxes in there so they could do hers. She said that Jackson Hewitt put down that I had a $5,000 metal roof and $1,800 insulation done to my house for an energy tax credit which I don't have. I gave her receipts for home improvements, but nothing with a metal roof (form 5695 tax relief). Not only that, but Jackson Hewitt would have also charged her $290 when it should have been just one filing even if she came in later. H&R Block did an amended tax for us and it just costs $100 because of this mistake of Jackson Hewitt. I went back out to Wal-Mart and told the guy there; the lady wasn't there, so she was to call me. If I don't get reimbursed my tax fees for preparation since I had the gold plan, I will be calling the Better Business Bureau and talk to her superiors. She could have got us in big trouble; not only that, she could have got us for another $290. Grrrr. I want my money back.
Mistake on 2008 taxes (interest refund) - I filed my 2008 taxes in 02/2009 and gave the preparer all my forms. I found out the following year the form for cancellation of debt was not filed, and I had to pay the taxes with my 2009 refund which was fine but I'm entitled to the interest due to the preparer not submitting it. I've been trying to get the interest since 2009 and getting the runaround from the manager at 3815 Eastern Ave. location. Last year before tax season was over, she assured me the check was in the mail. I have not seen it. Now it is 04/2012.
I went to JH in Jan. 2010 to file my taxes for 2011. I was told that I could not apply for educational credit until February 15. On February 15, 2012, I went back to JH and brought needed paperwork. First, I was never told that I would have to pay a fee to file the amended return. I paid $74 to have the federal amendment prepared. I was told that the paperwork was going to be sent out from their office. When I checked with the IRS to see if they have received my paperwork for my amended return, they said they didn't see anything. It has been 8 weeks and found out that my paperwork was never sent out by Jackson Hewitt, and the preparers are now saying that they never told me that that I was suppose to send out the paperwork myself. After doing the amended return on February 15 with JH, I called the preparer to find out if my paperwork had gone out. He assured me that it did. Now everyone that I spoke to in that office is denying everything that was said to me. I have spoken to the office manager on two occasions and the preparer on a few occasions and now 8 weeks later, I am in jeopardy of losing my car and behind in my bills because I was depending on the timeline of the receipt of my return money to pay my bills. I was unemployed when I filed in January 2012, and am unemployed still. I had to go to the main office to explain to them what had happen and they printed my federal amendment and state amendment and put it in an envelope with recipients address on the envelope for me to mail myself. This was never done at the first office I went to. I am very angry because no one is accepting responsibility for what they have done, and are saying they never told me that. Funny, I was wanting 8 weeks for something that wasn't coming, and was told various times that they sent my paperwork out after doing my amendment paperwork, even was called by this office to come for my state amendment because I could pay for it at the time.
Okay, well I went to Jackson Hewitt in Terrell, TX to get my taxes done. Everything went well, but I had recently adopted a child and the guy did not know what to put in the system so he called his branch manager in Rockwall, TX. She was to suppose to know his answer. I guess when it came time to get my income tax; it showed on the IRS web that it was indeed direct deposited in their account. Jackson Hewitt sent it back to the IRS and because they screwed my whole adoption credit up, I had to get an adoption review and since they sent my earned income back, the IRS put the whole thing on hold. So, I called Jackson Hewitt, I felt like they just turned their backs on me. I would call and the branch manager was never there. They still have not given me any answers except that I was not going to have to pay for my return. Well duh, I wouldn’t have paid them one cent of my money after that but I filed my return January 21, 2012 and here it is April and the IRS is telling me still 1 or 2 more months before they get a chance to review. I have not since heard from Jackson Hewitt. I would not recommend them to anyone. They could have at least backed me up gave me a loan until the return was done if they were so perfect on their work and back it up 100% which is what there commercial says. I was not jumping for joy around. I should sue the commercial for false advertisement because I am not happy.
The Jackson Hewitt Tax agency on Harrison Ave. Harrison, New Jersey had an offer of $40 off if the amount of service exceeds $140. Rather than charge the original quote, I initially received $90 for my wife and $60 for myself. When I arrived in the office, the fee had then become $80 for my wife plus $60 for myself, reducing the set amount to $140 and thereby making this discount offer void. I was not told by the tax preparer of this discount. I saw it advertised for this office later that day. Secondly, I was not given a copy, the only copy, of my son's Social Security card that I asked for. Third, I do not really know if the tax must be sent by me (no envelopes), or if it is done via email. This was very unclear.
My problem is not with the IRS. In fact, they have been helpful. I had my 2010 taxes done by Jackson Hewitt. They place over $25,000 in self-employment income, causing me to owe $8,901. I am not self-employed. I made arrangements with the IRS to make monthly payments. I paid over $3,800 toward this bill, even though I did not have to pay. An IRS agent discovered this error and told me that I should have an amendment done by another agency which I did. I filed a claim with Jackson Hewitt. They have denied my claim stating that they have done everything for us accurately. They stated that my claim is not covered under their guarantees. Yet, I have paid more than $3,000 in penalties, interest, tax amendment and user fees because of their initial. When I went back to the place where the taxes were done, they told me that it was a good thing that I purchased their Gold Guarantee. However, they are not paying me anything. They still do not see any error. I am looking for some way to collect what is due to me.
I called in to get the status of my tax return for a prior year because of an overseas government contract that other tax offices could not help me with. I was disturbed to hear this comment after my question: “Ma'am, so how much will the service cost me?” She said, "About $200.00." I said, "Why so much? Any reason why?" She said, “That's the way it is." I will never do business with Jackson and Hewitt. By the way, I was not pissed off or anything. But when I heard that comment from a so-called professional that has been doing business of filing taxes for over 12 years, I think that is poor professional skills and just flat out lazy for not even providing a customer with the appropriate answer that will keep the business reputation. I will never go to Jackson and Hewitt again and will tell others about my story. This was my first time going to this tax service and it will be my last. I called the IRS and they sent me the forms that I needed and it was very easy to file. Thanks IRS—they never told me that it is just the way it is. I will never ever go to Jackson and Hewitt again. First time impressions are everlasting impressions. Thanks, Nancy, for the lack of help from the main office in Moline, IL.
My mother went to check to see if she needed to file taxes. My mother is 78 y/o and has been retired on social security for 5 years. She receives small retirement and IRA payment by law. Those two things totaled $1200. She went and was charged $103.00 along with a $30 off coupon. I feel that my mother was taken advantage of. I've used your service a few times and now I'm done doing business with your company. I know you don't have to file taxes on social security. I paid $100 more than my mother and filed joint married with long form and did state taxes also.
I have used Jackson Hewitt for a couple of years to do my income tax returns. However, after reviewing how much they charge to file simple tax returns, I decided to seek other opportunities. After completing my 2011 returns with the new service I chose, it came time for me to e-file my returns. My returns were rejected a couple of times because of a PIN# that I don't even know exists. I searched my returns for the last two years and cannot locate my PIN that I need to file my returns or the PIN I had didn't match the PIN the IRS has. So I called Jackson Hewitt. The number I have been given the last two years for any questions is the number that I called. I spoke with a nice lady, she was polite and courteous. However, she could not answer my question at all. It was so bad she gave me the same office number to resolve my problem twice because they didn't even know who I should contact. Then on my third time calling, thinking it was a mistake or maybe it takes time to route the call, they put me on hold indefinitely!
My wife and I had our taxes done in 2010, by Jackson Hewitt. Now 2012, the IRS told us that we owe $7,000 that has to be paid by March 24, and it is now March 2nd, less than a month before we have to file again. My wife was told, that whoever fill out the forms did not put all the figures in and they did not have time to help us because we did not pay for the security. So we had to take the money out of our savings. I will tell everyone I know and everyone I meet to not go to Jackson Hewitt unless you want to take chances.
I received a $50.00 coupon in the mail, so I put it with all the papers for our tax lady. Our taxes are ready so I asked about the $50.00 coupon. She said that was for new customers only. My question is what do you do for your regular customers that keep coming back? This is our 3rd year I found the $25 coupon, but I feel the $50 is a good offer to keep me as a customer. Why was I mailed the $50 when it’s obvious to you that I am a customer of Jackson Hewitt? I would like to stay a happy customer. I hope this goes on someone’s desk. Thank you.
We have been to Jackson Hewitt in Yorktown, VA (Grafton Office) on 4 occasions to get our taxes done. JH has been paid and they still aren't complete. We've been told 6-8 different amounts on what we owe. Each time, there's a software glitch or miscalculation. There is zero accountability and the person completing our taxes is the manager of the branch (Bill **). The last time we were told to come in and sign for our taxes, he wasn't ready though I made an appointment a week in advance. I just finished an abrupt phone conversation with Bill and this time, he's running the taxes through a friend (again). This is unacceptable. Last time we will use JH to do our taxes.
I've simply called for information regarding my refund status. As when I filed, the woman nearly guaranteed my check would be there in 7 days, a billion fees later. I paid $450 to file and when I call today, an employee tells me to not call them because they don't have answers and then mumbles, “Here we go again with these idiots.” Okay, I understand the IRS may be running slow this year. However, when you work someplace that is involved in filing taxes, you should be prepared for a question or 2. If I paid $450 for a service, why should they be so rude and nasty? My refund is 20 days past what they said it would be and they refuse to speak to me.
They told me several years in a row that I would be getting a refund every time I filed, until I got wise and called the IRS myself and found out what was going on with my refunds. Well, every one that works at Jackson & Hewitt must make a % rating every time that they get a sucker to file with them. Lead them to keep thinking that they are fixing to get a refund, while they are being rude to you after you have filed and threatening to call the police because you are standing there, demanding your money like they said it would be there. Well, they are all sorry as hell and I hope the good Lord takes care of everyone with them that is crooked!
Jackson Hewitt has not provided service as promised. My husband and I went to Jackson Hewitt on 2/6/12 to have our taxes prepared, which costs approximately $500 which we paid at this time. We were to receive a $395 refund from VA and we were to pay taxes to MO and the IRS. We began checking VA department of taxation for refund status and continued to receive a message that taxes had not been filed. My husband went to JH on 2/27 for answers. He was told our taxes had not been filed due to being lost in the mail and that we needed to sign one form. We were not informed as to why we had to sign this one form if our complete tax returns were missing. My husband signed at that time and I stopped by after work on 2/28 to sign and to speak with a supervisor or someone in authority. The only person there was an office manager that apparently wasn't aware that she should be tracking the mailing of those taxes filed. She stated multiple times that she hadn't received notification that the taxes hadn't been received and that our taxes were not the only ones in the missing envelope as if that would make the situation better. I asked that the district manager call me, which has still not occurred nor do we have word that our taxes have been filed. I called this office again last Friday (3/2) to ask for the district manager and had to leave a message to return my call. This office is unprofessional. When I walked in, I disturbed this woman's solitaire game besides her being uneducated and, to say the least, ineffective. The fee we paid was excessive in the first place but then to receive below average service is completely unacceptable. Obviously, JH needs to train its tax preparers in tax preparation as well as tax filing and follow through as well as professionalism. This is not a professional organization and I deeply regret going to Jackson Hewitt. We now have to go to great lengths to simply find out if our taxes have been filed.
Anyhow, I go in to get my taxes done. This old guy, Barry was his name, kept focusing on my ** rather than the tax return. He hit on me the whole time and I just wanted out of there. A relatively simple return for head of household was over $450! This creep has called my phone over six times already wanting me to go out with him. Such a loser with a limpy. Totally unprofessional!
My Elderly Mother Was Taken Advantage Of: One of the agents at the West Jefferson, NC Walmart told my mother that she would do her taxes free of charge. My mother explained to the agent that she worked part-time for Walmart, and that she also drew social security. The agent told her repeatedly that there would be absolutely no charge to do her taxes. Halfway through the process, the agent started having trouble and started telling my mother there would be charges. My mother told her to just stop, that she didn't want to continue. The agent intimidated my mother by telling her that she would be charged cancellation fees, and also that the agent herself would be penalized. This scared my mother, and she let her continue. My mother was charged $162.00. I've called the home office in Charlotte 3 times to ask for a refund and to complain, and no one will return my calls. I am also very disappointed in Walmart that they would partner with such an unethical company. This company takes advantage of seniors, so beware!
In 2008, I filed taxes with Jackson Hewitt at one of the locations - Texas. At the time, the tax preparer (Tony - Branch Manager) did my taxes. I was asked a few questions and the one I could answer was the day I purchased my home. We looked on Sumter County website and she advised me we can file for First Time Homeowner credit. We did accordingly. All went through and I received my return. My job requires a lot of relocating. I can work six to one year in different locations. Now I'm here in NJ and received a letter from the IRS that I should have never received credit because I purchased the house prior to the law going to effect. Nevertheless, I called Jackson Hewitt to please help me with this matter since originally, they prepared the filing for me and they have insured which should cover me for these types of issues. I got nowhere. No callback, no customer service was provided. They referred me to a website and a 1800 number. Some took my info and supposedly filed a claim. Three months later, I'm in the same position. I finally made an appointment with the IRS myself. I was told by Jackson Hewitt customer service rep that I can go to any Jackson Hewitt and they would have to help me since I was covered by their guarantee from being a client. I asked for the nearest location to me and he gave the Walmart Union NJ location located on Rt 22. Next day, I was there. To my surprise, the person there was very rude, closed the curtain and told me not his problem. I would have to call 1800 customer service and let them deal with the problem since he did not make the mistake, he will not be responsible for it. He told me to leave. I need help with this matter the soonest. I have to now repay the IRS $7500 and have gotten nowhere with Jackson Hewitt. I have nowhere to turn. I'm desperate and scared. Jackson Hewitt has no direct number to contact anyone, no corporate headquarter number, just 1800 and no one knows anything. They just transfer you around and around. Please help me.
Earlier this month (Feb), I used the Jackson Hewitt kiosk in my local Walmart .The preparer was rude and not really paying attention to my questions. She made several attempts at filing my info but kept blaming her computer for freezing . Once she claimed to finished my tax form, she gave me Smart card and told me to wait 24 hrs, then activate it. After doing so, I waited four weeks to call the number on the card looking for my refund. The card keeps saying it is invalid. After several times trying, I went back to my local Walmart kiosk where I was rudely greeted by a manager who tried several times to activate my card and look for my refund. The manager became rude and offensive too me. He told me to leave or he would call cop.
I haven't had a legitimate complaint until today. JH automated system put out a bogus message that in 24-48 hours, my IRS refund will be direct deposited into my account. JH phone rep says that is an automated response according to when I filed my taxes or like it was going to say that anyway. Well, where's my refund? Automated system is saying March 6th. Today is Feb 22! Come on. As a consumer, I feel like it is misleading and unfair.
I filed my taxes on 2/03/12 and waiting in line (standing) for over an hour, when they finally ask me if I had an appointment. I told them no because I had called and was told they were only taking walk-ins. I thought it out because it was my only day off that week and I really needed to get them done as soon as possible. Like many, I am depending on the money that I have worked hard for. I finally got them finished and ended up paying around $400 and selected my refund in 7 to 13 days. I finally called on the 14th day and spoke with a very rude employee that made me feel like a burden to her. This really upsets me because I am a very calm person and just wanted some answers. She told me to call back in a few hours and my check should be there because it was showing that the bank has received my check and they were just waiting for one to be printed. I did not want the confrontation so I did not call back; neither did I get a call from them. I did call the next day and was given attitude again. It is now day 17 and I called again and was told that they were waiting for the IRS and it is the IRS fought. This may be true, but the professionalism of Jackson Hewitt has nothing to do with the IRS. She proceeded to tell me that the IRS has accepted my refund and it is on its way to the back any day. I asked her if she was sure and she said "yes". Then I was furious and I told her I have no idea how she can be so sure of this because I hadn't even given her my name to look anything up. I am really upset that I paid so much money and feel as if I have been ripped off. They should not be able to advertise 7 to 13 days if the IRS has 3 weeks. I want some of my money back and Jackson Hewitt should hang it up and not even open their doors next year. I will never step foot in a Jackson Hewitt office again. I have even been considering avoiding Wal-Mart while they are there too. I know many people that went to H&R Block and filed around the same time I did and all have gotten their checks. So my question is what is Jackson Hewitt doing?
1. The IRS is the problem with people not getting their refunds on time this year. There’s even a problem with the “Where's My Refund” site. They are the ones giving the tax prep offices the bogus info. New software, fraud system overload, etc. Every time they say they will have it fixed by, they then come up with another excuse. But 80% of the people have gotten refunds on time and early! Get mad at IRS, you are the ones paying them (if you pay taxes). 2. You are never paying for your refund to come in 7-13 days. That’s the "standard estimated time" the IRS says they should release your money. If someone tells you they are charging you to get it in that time, go somewhere else. 3. A rapid refund is a product of H&R Block, not Jackson Hewitt. It's RAL; it's a loan of $1500 you may be approved for in 24-48 hours after the IRS accepts the return filed. If you are not approved for the loan you are not charged the extra bank fees associated with that loan. The bank never tells Jax-Hew why you are denied for the loan. That’s due to the privacy acts passed by congress and state governments. The bank has to send you a letter. 4. Once you e-file with a tax company, you can't then take it back if it's been accepted by the IRS just because you don't like the outcome of refund or fees or can't claim a dependent, etc. 5. Listen to what the tax preparer is saying to you. Ask questions if you don't understand something. It's your responsibility to give the tax prep the correct info. It's the tax prep’s responsibility to do the return correctly with the info you have given. If you tax preparer isn't talking to you, get someone else! 6. Tax services are businesses just like McDonald’s. They are providing a service and need to make money to pay their people (who must now be certified for 2012) and their overhead. There are free sites on the computer to do your own taxes. Even if you think your return is "simple" there’s a lot you don't know. A return for a married couple with 2 kids, income under $30,000, may require 6-10 different forms, worksheets and schedules. And the preparer has to know how to do each one along with the current laws and guidelines regarding each. A good tax preparer will spend at least 10 minutes talking with each new customer, asking questions and getting the paperwork together. They should talk you through the return and explain anything needed. After that they should explain the company paperwork: fees, refund dates and what ifs as you sign it. Stop them at any time to ask questions. You have all the time in the world to stop that return from being sent to the IRS. Once it is submitted, it's done.
I arrived at the Jackson Hewitt in Willistonn, ND on 02/02/12. My tax prep person was Mima. From the moment I sat down at the desk, it was a nightmare. She and her coworker played and ate food in front of us. When she found out that my tax were to hard for her, she told me she had to have her boss do them. Mima was the manager of that location. I consented and spoke to her boss, Gina, that night. On 2/3/12, I called Gina and asked her if she had completed my taxes and she stated that she haven't but she would that night. She told me to go into the office on 2/4/12, and that the tax prep person can print them out for me. I got there but they couldn't print them out because he couldn't get the password to work. Gina stated that it's impossible. Gina stated that she will be in Williston that next day and she will bring them for me to sign. I got there and after I waited for an hour, she stated that she forgot them. She stated the printer wasn't working so she couldn't print them, however, she was printing everyone else's. I had to call Jackson Hewitt corporate office In NJ and leave a complaint with them and they stated someone would call me back, but I am still waiting. I even called the owner's office in MT and haven't heard back from them either. I think the experience I've had with Jackson Hewitt and the $320.00 I've spent with that company is a lesson learned. I will never step foot in a Jackson Hewitt office ever again.I will say this, H&R Block, I used them once and they were good. I will not refer Jackson Hewitt to my worse enemy. They still have not contacted me nor have I gotten my papers yet. IRS will be called on Tuesday. Moral of the story is to use someone else.
I see that there are plenty of people on this site that have complaints about Jackson Hewitt. If there is that much of a problem then learn to do them yourself for free. Anyone who has supposedly checked the IRS website can clearly see that they say once you have electronically filed you can expect to wait 10-21 days to receive your refund. I wish people would stop blaming the tax place and start reading. I understand people want their money, but they have to be patient.
I filed my taxes on the 2nd of February under the deal that I would receive my return in 7-13 days. This is the second year I have used Jackson Hewitt. Last year, they charged me $102 for their services and my check got there on time. This year, I was charged $202 which in all honesty I feel is ridiculous but if I could get my check in 13 days, I would be fine. The 13th day comes and I call up to Jackson Hewitt to see if I can pick up my check. Not only were they rude about it but my check wasn't there. The 14th day comes and goes, still nothing but rudeness. I was told they do not print checks on any other day but Friday. Here we are on Friday, the 16th day. I called up there this morning and was told that they would call me when they had my check, no explanation as to why my check was not there today other than "We can't control what the IRS does". At this point I am livid. I am 26 years old, unemployed, and homeless. As of right now, I am staying in a hotel and was counting on my tax return to, at the very least, pay for another 2 weeks in this hotel if not, put my tax return down on an apartment. When I spoke with them over the phone this morning I told them, in a very angry tone, that I would be in there office before the day is out and for them to call whoever they had to to get my check in the office. I went up to their office and was told the same thing "We can't control what the IRS does". I understand that but what you can do is not advertise a 7-13 day deal when you don't even honor it. In my opinion, I had been deceived and was being charged for something that was not fulfilled. I was calm but very angry in the office, but I did not make a scene. I explained to them that since I had no place to go that I would remain in their office until I could get an answer as to where my check was. A woman by the name of Connie then called her area manager and spoke with him. She pulled up a window on her screen that had "First Republic Bank" on the window screen and I looked down and my status said "approved". At this point, I relaxed because I figured my check was ready. Connie put "Christopher **" out of the Knight Arnold office here in Memphis on the phone. What Chris explained to me was that the IRS, not Jackson Hewitt, said my check would be there in 7-13 days. I quickly interrupted and explained to Chris that I was staring at a Jackson Hewitt advertisement for the 7-13 day deal. Chris quickly said that it was the IRS who was at fault. I strongly disagree and told Chris that if that were the case, they should remove the 7-13 day deal off of their stuff, especially since apparently it is completely unreliable and deceives people into believing they will get their check, when in fact, it will take days, if not. weeks to come in. I told Chris I would like to cancel my service with them and that I would much rather sleep in my car knowing I will receive my full refund of $732 in a few weeks rather than be deceived and angry while sleeping in my car knowing I was conned out of $200. Chris said that was fine but that I would have to wait for my check to come in, they will still take their $200 fee and that I would have to refile with someone else. **-believable. I told Chris that nothing he did helped me at all, and that I still felt conned and deceived and that I had never had this happen to me. Every time I have filed my taxes, I have gotten them back the day the preparation place told me and that I believe that Jackson Hewitt is at fault and in the process conning people out of money. I simply do not think this is right. I understand some things may go wrong during this process but why on earth would you still charge someone for something you did not do? I left their office angry and told them I would be back the next day, and the day and the day after to see how things are developing. They explained to me that would not be necessary. I once again explained to them that I am hopeless and do not have the money currently to keep paying for the hotel I am staying at. I have no family willing to help. I have no gas to get anywhere. I have no food and absolutely nothing to do considering the fact that I am unemployed and that I felt they owed me room an board for their mistake and explained to them I may be forced to park my car in their parking lot and sleep in my car until my check arrives... because I have no gas to get anywhere other than their parking lot. I did not let them respond. I was simply too angry to continue to sit there and be deceived and conned. I told them I would leave today but I would be calling back every hour to see where my check is. I may be taking it a bit far but I am not someone who has a lot of money, by my standards, being returned to them. I have $530 coming to me after they take their fees and I saw it with my own eyes. I had been approved by the First Republic Bank so why is it difficult for them to print my check? I just don't understand it. I gave them the benefit of the doubt for 2 days but when I found this complaint site last night, I knew this wasn't just a situation I was in, but a situation plenty of people are dealing with in regards to Jackson Hewitt. I will never use their services again and I will let everyone I know what has happened. I hope they are investigated and brought to justice. There are no more honest people in America. Greed is the only motivating factor now. Everyone in a position to ** you over, will ** you over.
I do not work for Jackson Hewitt and believe them. HR Block and Liberty all vastly overcharge for their services but to their defense, the IRS has had computer issues due to an anti-fraud software they installed this year. Also, if you go to "where's my refund" they have a PSA explaining as such and that their WMF system hasn't been working either. I've seen complaints about not receiving RALs within 7-13 days. A RAL should take no longer than 24-48 hours for $1,500 of your return. The balance should arrive within 10-21 days per the IRS. As for paying over $400 that's no one's fault but your own. These chain type tax shops are franchises. They pay 25-35% royalties so you're always going to pay more. Keep in mind; they don't get paid until your refund comes in if it comes in at all. So when the IRS encounters processing delays, it's out of the preparers hands. They want your return to come in so they can get paid too. Do your research. There are local independents that will perform the same services for a fraction of the cost. Name recognition doesn't mean everything. Those big chains hold training classes a few weeks prior to tax season so there's a good chance you'll have a green horn doing your taxes.
Well, we filed our tax return on Feb. 1 and the fees were around $400. Well, they got our state check and kept the whole thing and didn’t even call or notify us. The state check was $459 and they kept the whole ** thing! Now we’re supposed to get federal in 7 to 15 days and still there’s nothing. Why do we have to pay all these crazy fees when they didn’t provide any services we paid for? We specifically asked for the fees to come out of the federal return but I guess everyone is getting this done to them. Why isn’t someone doing something about this?
Since Friday of last week, the automated response has told me my money would be deposited in my account in 24 to 48 hours. Again that was Friday, Feb. 10th. This is the 16th and still no money. I will never recommend or use this company in the future. By the amount of complaints on this website, I'm not alone. Wake up JH, you are losing customers!
I filed my taxes on Jan. 16th in the Bonham Texas office with preparer Amy **! I told her that I paid state taxes in the amount of $6.00. She placed this amount online $63 of my 1040 form where she asks for federal taxes paid or owed. This mistake caused my refund to be placed on hold and has yet to be released. Amy ** refuses to talk to me and she says that this is not her fault and all of the managers over her will not return my phone calls. I have three children and I depend on my refund, this is Jackson Hewitt’s mistake and they refuse to talk to me about the issue and address it. I should not have to wait a week to talk to someone about this issue; it should be addressed now!
We have 4 young kids, so we found it easier in the past for my husband to go in and file, since he is the one with the income coming in, and I go back when he gets home to watch the kids and sign. Well he went on Jan 26th, and the office he went to only had 1 lady working, so by the time she got done with my husband that night, she had another person, who had been waiting that she had to do, before they closed, so she told my husband to tell me to come first thing in the morning to sign them. I went in the next day, Friday, Jan 27th, and signed the papers. The lady threw them in the filing cabinet and said, "our check would be in between 7-13 business days". We called everyday in between that time, and got a "no" everyday. I was even hung up on, right after a couple of times. On the 13th day, after they said no, we asked if they can find out what was going on, so the lady was real helpful, got online, and said "the IRS didn't accept it until Feb 9th, and looks like we didn't send it over to them until Feb 8th, because it only takes them a day to accept it". She was even very puzzled, as to why it didn't get sent over until Feb 8th, when it shows that we filed and signed on the 26th. I called an area manager, to see if we could get our $400 back that we had paid to get our taxes back in 7-13 days, and she very rudely refused it, and accused me of probably waiting 2 weeks to go and sign the papers. I'm sorry, but we are a family of 6 with 1 income, and we rely on our tax money every year. There is no way I would wait 2 weeks to go and sign it, especially knowing my 8 year old son's birthday is coming up, and I needed that money! I felt very disrespected! I have even been trying to get hold of the main store's manager, since the area manager was so rude, and apparently the main store manager is never at work! I will never go back to Jackson Hewitt, and I even posted a warning to all my friends on Facebook, and let them know what had happened, so that way, they don't get done over like we have.
In Trenton New Jersey, all of their Jackson Hewitt offices print out their checks on Fridays only, so they say, even though my brother-in-law picked up his check last Tuesday, and on 2 Saturdays prior. Why is this? They say it's the IRS schedule of check printouts. That's a lie, because I spoke to an IRS agent after calling the automated system, and it was confirmed that their end was completed in handling my taxes. I also called The Republic Bank in Louisville KY, where they affiliate, and their automated system had received and cleared my funds as well. When I alerted the Pennington & Ewing St branches of my research and findings, my social security number was removed from the Republic Bank's system altogether. I spoke to a preparer last night, who looked up my information, and reassured me that I would be able to pick up my check today. Now, 3 different people are telling me otherwise, and have been very nasty, not wanting me to speak to their owner/operator. Now, I'm here, putting them on blast. Since then, my information is now back in the Louisville KY Republic Bank's system, but it's ** up how they can mess with money, that's not theirs. I was charged $466 to have them prepare my taxes, and put up with their unprofessional team for what?
I did my taxes on 1-27-12. I was told I would have my taxes back 7-13 days. Still no damn refund .I call them many times,they say they don't have the checks (yet). What's the deal? I paid them almost $400.00. Wheres my damn money? I called and ask for the main office number.they keep changing the subject. I will never use y'all again.
I found this complaint/review page after searching for an answer to a question on the internet. Thank God, I had already realized that Jackson-Hewitt was not a company that I wished to do business with and that really shouldn't be allowed to continue doing business, period. I had used them for about three years in a row before I realized that having my taxes prepared and getting my refund in a timely manner didn't have to be so miserable. I haven't used them for the last two years and am doing my taxes for free on TurboTax and have actually gotten my money faster than I ever did with JH. I had always prepared our taxes for us, but everyone was getting the rapid refund where you get a portion of it that day--a refund anticipation loan. But what JH doesn't tell you is many people won't qualify for this loan and you are charged for it whether you get it or not. You must agree to pay beforehand, and once they prepare your taxes, you are obligated to them at that point whether they have sent them in or not. Most people need the money so badly that they feel it's worth a few hundred dollars to get your money so quick, but many times this isn't the case. The first year we used them, we didn't qualify for the loan, because it was determined that we owed some old taxes from Mississippi where we used to live that we weren't aware of. We didn't blame JH for this; we blamed ourselves. So IRS took their money and sent us the rest, and needless to say, this took a while and cost us quite a bit for JH to prepare these really simple taxes. The second year, we still didn't get the refund loan for one reason or another (They never tell you why.), and our money never comes in on the day quoted either. Not to mention that when they are interviewing for employees, it seems that a requirement to work for them is that you must be rude, nasty, and have absolutely no customer service skills at all! They actually get mad if you call to find out if your money, which was supposed to be there three days ago, is there yet! They actually will tell you "Don't call us; we'll call you"! Because we are the kind of people who must be hit on the head to get a message (and because we can always use any money coming our way pretty badly), we decided to use them one more year, which turned out to be the worst yet. We knew at that point we would never use them again! Since that time, I have learned that because of the wonderful debit cards that are now in use, companies like JH are now obsolete when it comes to those who just need their money fast! I have gotten my own money faster for the last two years, faster than JH ever got it for me and without paying $200.00-300.00 for their rude nonexistent service! This year was the best yet, even with the issues that the IRS is having trying to update their systems, so that people aren't able to defraud our government or at least it's harder to do so than it has been. After I read some of these complaints, I felt like such a kindred spirit with these others and would do anything in my power to stop JH from being able to continue doing this to others. Unfortunately, what's "in my power" isn't very much. But I know that someone does have the power to do something, and it's time. The sad part is that there are so many more with experiences just like these or worse out there like me who just let it go and carried on with like by chalking it up to experience well-learned. But how many people need to be schooled by this company before they get schooled on what happens to businesses that are dishonest, immoral, and unethical! They need to have their licenses revoked and better yet, fined!
My son received an inheritance from a Vanguard 401K. He took out the money in December 2010. We took our taxes in to a Jackson Hewitt office in Wal-Mart in Fort Worth, Texas. My son was a student in 2010 and I filed him as my dependent. I showed the tax lady the 1099 R from Vanguard and she said that my son did not have to pay inheritance taxes and he did not have to file a tax return since he was my dependent. This past December 2011, he started getting letters from the IRS asking why he did not file a tax return. We sent documentation stating he was my dependent and they responded. They again wanted to know why he had not filed a tax return and gave him a deadline of 45 days from January 20th. We took the form back to the same lady doing this year's taxes at the Wal-Mart and again she said that he did not have to pay taxes and told us to call the IRS and Vanguard. My son called them and they both said he had to pay taxes. The tax lady stated that if he had to do a form that she would do it for free and assured us that he did not have to pay taxes on the inheritance. After we spoke to Vanguard and the IRS, we went back to her because for one thing, I had taken out a gold seal guarantee up to $5,000 dollars. She was rude and told us that we need to call the IRS and tell them about a publication regarding inheritance and she would have to charge David as a new customer because all the IRS wanted was for him to file a tax return and still argued that he did not have to pay the inheritance tax. We went to another Jackson Hewitt and told him about the situation. He did my son's taxes for free but claimed he had to pay an AMT tax. They would not honor the gold seal since it was my son and not me even though my son was my dependent on the tax return. Because of their negligence by not having him file and pay the Vanguard tax, he now owes double what he has to pay. After talking to a CPA, he is not supposed to have to pay the AMT tax. Now we are in the process of talking with an attorney.
I filed with Jackson Hewitt on 1/25 and on 2/10 I still got no refund. I called the IRS directly and now they are saying 2/15. My friend who filed at Liberty, days later has her refund. Don't try to call Jackson Hewitt and inquire on your refund status. They never answer the phone. I guess they’re too busy answering complaint calls from people who want to know where their refund is. When I did finally get someone on the phone, they said, “Did we call you? If not, that means it's not here.” Excuse me for wanting to inquire on my money. They broke their contract of 7-13 days, so breach of contract means they should be refunding my tax preparation fees. Do yourself a favor and never go to Jackson. I used Liberty for several years and never had a single issue. Go to Liberty! I think the IRS and Jackson should figure out together when they’re going to send my check for fees under this breach of contract. I'd probably get that check faster than a refund loan from Jackson. I am very disappointed.
I had my taxes done. I was not told my check was theirs till a week later. Then when I got my check, it was mixed up with some other check number. I could not cash the check. But the other party with the other check got to cash his. How? I don't know. Then I returned the check to where I picked it up and was told "You didn't get this check from here." I figured out that the checks look different, because it was printed at a Wal-Mart location. So I had to travel across town to where I had them prepared, hoping another check could be printed, only to find out I have to wait even longer because the bank would not issue another check because they did not believe the tax preparer that this was happening. So the printed check had to be photographed and faxed to the bank. Again I have to wait even longer. Every time I call the office, they don't know what I'm talking about and have no way of helping me. I filed my taxes on January 21, 2012; it is now February 10, 2012, and still now, the check is just a disappointment. I was told on February 9, my check would be printed with the next batch at 4 o'clock. I called; still no check and instead I'm told that they don't print checks that day and there is no one working at the Wal-Mart location where I had it prepared. Again, another day goes by with no check. I feel that I should not have to pay the preparation fees due to this error. I was dissatisfied and the check was not on time and was wrong in the first place. I want my money back, and this is the last time I will have Jackson Hewitt do my taxes.
My partner and I went to Jackson Hewitt today in Covington Georgia at the Wal-Mart location as I have filed there before, including last year. We went to tax preparer Verla ** and sat down to start the process. We explained to her that may partner Julie was going to claim my daughter and as head of household as I Karen do not work and did not work any of last year. She looked at Julie’s tax W2 and told her that she didn’t have to file taxes. We explained to this preparer that we did have to and we wanted to file for my daughter. The preparer said that she thought that what we were saying was iffy and that she doesn't deal with fraud cases when we were just there to file regular taxes the right legal way as we do every year. She started folding my partner’s W2 up and handed it back to us telling us that we were frauds. I confronted her and told her she can’t judge us and that we weren't frauds and to explain the situation. She threatened to call security and have us thrown out of the store. I then called the Jackson Hewitt line and they connected me to a manager who said they would have someone call me today and I never heard anything back from them on this matter. We, after leaving Wal-Mart, went to another tax place (not Jackson Hewitt) and filed with no problem at all. I am not sure if Verla ** had an issue with gays or what the issue was. She wouldn't explain anything and was just rude. I believe that other people should be warned of this occurrence. I would like a formal apology from the company for being accused of being fraudulent.
I could never get an answer on the phone when I called so I took all my information with me to their cubicle in Walmart. I was told that the standard amount for four W-2 forms was around $100. I had a coupon for $25 off tax-prep. When all was said and done, it cost $200.50. I have medical issue that keep me from being able to sit up for very long at a time. It had already taken more than an hour and a half. I finally threw up my hands and agreed to pay because I would not have been able to sit like that again. H&R Block quoted me $104 as well but I had a coupon for Jackson & Hewitt. I will steer everyone I see waiting in line how to get to the H&R office.
I went in on Feb 8, 2012 to do my taxes. My taxes are simple with a couple of dependents. I don't make over 50.000 just simple. I didn't file in 2010 but I didn't owe the IRS. I asked how much for both, the girl told me she didn't know until the end. Now I never imagined that she would say after sending it, threw 731.00. I nearly passed out. I wanted to scream but she had sent it . Then I asked why so much. She said well, you got the earned income credit and that's free money so JH will take it from there. I felt so violated. These people need to be stopped and an investigation needs to be done and us the consumer need to get our money back. To anyone who needs their taxes done, find another way. Will never use them again.
First, I was made to wait for over an hour for a previously given appointment. I was at their stall from 7:15 PM to 10:30 PM! Then, I was charged $270.00 for one W2 form tax return, with no explanation of reason for such a charge. If that wasn't enough, my tax return was an amount I just could not agree with, and they insisted that was it, with no satisfactory explanation. I need to know who I can contact to find out what amount I should get back, without being duped.
When JH finally got around to telling me I had to pay for their services up front and I declined their services, they refused to give me back my wife's W-2 and mine. I have a call placed to our U.S. Senator Mike Rubio to see what, if anything can be done about this. Taxes are hard enough for us without being screwed by companies like Jackson Hewitt.
I went into the Jackson Hewitt office in Albuquerque, New Mexico to pick up a check and there was a customer being helped. So I waited patiently for 45 minutes. A man walks in and he waits no more than one minute and she gives him a check. So I asked her I came for my check too and she told me I had to wait. So 15 minutes go by and still waiting for something that takes 30 seconds to do! She’s taking her time so now it's more than an hour. I told her I have been waiting long enough and she raised her voice at me and said she didn’t know that I was coming for a check. Well, she never acknowledged me in the first place and did not ask me are you picking up a check or doing taxes or I'll be right with you. She was rude and loud. I know these people are trained right and with customer skills. I have never seen a person like this at Jackson Hewitt all the years I’ve been doing taxes. I definitely will go elsewhere next year!
A lot of you made out pretty good, considering I paid $479 to have my state and federal taxes prepared! Welcome to America, the home of squeezing the life out of people because you can. I asked the guy who did them how they came up with that number, and he said, "I don't know." I could tell he didn't and felt bad about it, so I wasn't going to take it out on him. As far as how long it took you, guys, we can't blame them when the IRS put out a statement telling us that, like a bunch of buffoons, they waited until the tax season to change their system, so it would take longer than usual if you filed before 1/26/12.
I filed my taxes with JH last year with no problems, but this year I decided to do direct deposit. My bank account info was entered wrong; therefore, it could not be deposited and was rejected by my bank. I discovered the mistake not JH. I brought it to their attention and was told for an entire week that my bank would deposit the money. Finally, after I told them to do a research form it was done and then I was told it would take 2 business days. It’s been a week and still nothing! The money was sent by the IRS on the 24th of January. It’s now the7th of February--where’s my money? At no time did anyone ask for the correct account info. I had to make them enter that into the computer. I will call everyday till this money is deposited.
Two years straight I have used Jackson Hewitt and been asked for cash by preparer. Even when my girlfriend went to pick up, her check preparer asked for lunch money. And on top of being hit up for money I can’t for the life of me get any customer support. I think federal government should shut Jackson Hewitt down. Really, do you not pay your employees enough, Jackson Hewitt, that they have to ask people who made less than $15000 in the tear to pay for their lunch?
Well, I had prepared my 2011 online for free. Then when I was claiming my children, they said I had to pay extra for filing married together. I finished and entered my bank info to get direct deposit and they gave me a date by the 24 then I check still nothing. Then the webpage they display says by the 1st if you electronically filed so 1st came and went still no answers. Now the IRS website says it was accepted on the 20th of Jan and that I will receive my refund in my account on the 7th of Feb. Well, today is the 7th and still nothing. I have not received anything in the mail or e-mail. I called the 1800 # and they said they can’t help me I have to call a local agent. I said, “I did it online why do I need to call a local office?” So I did and the local office says, “We can't help you, you had done it online.” So I call the 1800# back and they still say they can’t help me. ** do mean you can't help me? I can’t get an answer from anyone and I am in tears. I dislike Jackson Hewitt. They need to be investigated ASAP with the company. My husband had said we should have gone with H&R Block like we had done in the past.
I was a repeat customer for Jackson Hewitt this year because I was completely satisfied when I did my taxes through them last year. I went to Walmart and the kiosk they have inside the store (same place I went before). When he was finishing up my taxes, he said he was having a problem e-filing my state taxes, but assured me that he would figure it out. The next day, he called me and told me that I had to come in because he needed my signature. When I went in, he had me sign my state taxes and told me I would have to mail them in... Really? OK. Well, I got my check on the first day, they said it would be available (about a weeks wait). When I picked it up, it was a different check than I received last year but it was a cashier's check. I took it to my bank and they called the number on the check to get an authorization code for the check. They couldn't understand the code so they tried to call back. It wouldn't give them the code again and placed them on hold forever. They never did get a hold of a person, so they put my check on hold for 2 weeks. Well, the next day, I called Jackson Hewitt to find out about the company/bank that was on their check so that I could call to figure this out. The people there had no idea who this company was (Avent Financial), which I thought was bizarre. I went home and looked up the information for this company and finally talked to a person to find out what I could do to get the code or something. Well, the code is only given out once to protect multiple people from getting the code to cash the check (whatever!). He said, I could go back to Jackson Hewitt and have them fax a letter requesting to have the code reset so that my bank could call back and have them fax the check info. I had the bank print a copy of the check and even took in the fax number to Jackson Hewitt. When I got there, I explained what I had done and what I needed them to do. They told me that is not their responsibility and I'd just have to suck it up and wait for my check. They are completely unprofessional and unwilling to help their customers with anything. This all happened in Murray, UT.
I filed my taxes on 1/20/12 at Jackson Hewitt in North Carolina, the IRS accepted them that day, I paid almost $400 for the RAL and to receive a rapid refund in 8-15 days. I received a RAL on 1/21. The online tax manager has said my check was printed for almost two weeks now. I spoke with the tax consultant at the Jackson Hewitt in Walmart and she told me my money would be there that Friday and showed me on her computer where JH had already taken out their fees, but when I called JH that filed my taxes, they keep telling me my money is not there. How can they take their fees out if the money is not there? It has now been 18 days and I have still not received my refund. Jackson Hewitt has not given me any information, I had to call the IRS myself to find out what was going on. They told me 2/8 was my direct deposit date and if I did not receive my refund by 2/13 to call them back, the 8th will be 20 days and the 13th will be 25 days. Is that not a breach of contract? Jackson Hewitt does not want to reimburse me a portion of my fee which is unacceptable. I understand they have to make money, but to charge $400 to file my taxes (which was free for them through eFile), I could have done that myself. I will never use Jackson Hewitt again and I will be sure to spread the word about the terrible services I received. The only reason I went there was because bills were calling and I do not make much at a total of $18,000 annually. I am helping to support my sister and a 3-year-old nephew while she is going to college for Human Services. Jackson Hewitt is taking advantage of those who are in poverty and need help. Therefore, they offer them a $1500 RAL, charge over $400, and then do not hold up to their end of the deal. I think this should be illegal.
I decided to use Jackson Hewitt, because I was given discount coupons, as well as being told that I could get a $50.00 deduction from the fees, by switching to them. Boy, was I in for it. I wish I stuck with H and R block. First of all, I was given a specific date, and is currently still waiting on my return. On top of that, I couldn't use the discounts offered. Along with that, after I was told I wouldn't be given my return on the date given, I got the runaround answers, as to why I had yet to get it. Sad to say, every employee I have spoken with, has been unprofessional, and I feel as if they could care less, as to whether the customers are satisfied, or not. I must say, I will never use Jackson Hewitt again. They have hidden fees, higher fees, no customer support system at all.
A major deduction was missed. I asked for my return to be cancelled. They said they couldn't. I just want to be rid of Jackson Hewitt and re file.
I have used H&R Block every year in the past. This year I wanted to try a different tax place to do my taxes. So I went to Jackson Hewitt- biggest mistake in my life. This is the first year I used them and it will definitely be the last. I would not recommend them to anyone. Jackson Hewitt was supposed to be cheaper and be able to get the refund back faster. By the time Jackson Hewitt was done preparing my simple tax return married filing jointly with one kid, they charged me a total of $386.00 to prepare my federal and state. Which did not impress me at all because H & R Block prepared the same tax return and ended up being $120.00 cheaper. Then at Jackson Hewitt I filed rapid refund to get my refund back in 7 to 13 days. Wwong! Another disappointment! I am now on the 15th day that my refund has been accepted and I still have not received my refund yet, federal or state. I have called the Jackson Hewitt office several times to get an update when I would be receiving my tax refund and I have spoken with a different person almost everytime. Every person I have talked to has given me different information, different dates, some said my refund is there, some says I owe back taxes, which I knew was a lie. So I called the IRS to see if my refund was being held for back taxes that I didn't know about. IRS said no, that my refund had been accepted. So I called Jackson Hewitt back numerous times and everytime I'm still getting a different story. Then I found out that when my refund does come in, Jackson Hewitt deposits it in their account and cuts me a cashier's check minus their fees. Which is fine with me, but why should I be charged rapid refund fees when my refund was way over the amount of days that I paid to get my refund back. I mean my refund is already 7 days pass the 13th day I paid to have my refund by. So that's 20 days all together. When I asked Jackson Hewitt about their policy, all they told me is that they have a 5-day grace period. I said “Okay, that's understandable but you are 7 days over.” They told me it's not their fault the IRS had delays on some tax returns. I said, “Well, it's not my fault either”, and that I well over paid them to prepare my taxes. Besides their customer service over the phone when checking on the status, 80% of their representatives were very rude and very unprofessional. Today is February 4, 2012 and I have still not received neither my Federal or State tax refund yet and I am pissed! Every year I have used H&R Block I have never waited longer than 1 week and I would have both my Federal and State refund. H&R Block, I am sorry I left you all this year to try somewhere else but I have learned a valuable lesson and I will switch back to you next year. If you have used Jackson Hewitt and you have had good results and you are happy with there services, I'm proud for you. But, I'm not satisfied at all about the services Jackson Hewitt has provided for me and like I stated earlier, I would not recommend them to anyone and I will not be a returning customer.
I filed my taxes with Jackson Hewitt on January 24, 2012 and was told it would be 10 days. I called today about 3 or 4 times and was told not to call them, they would call me! Hmm, I am sure most people like me need their tax money. And that's why we call so much. I will never go back to Jackson Hewitt ever again. I have been going there for 6 years never again will I go there. Oh yeah and not to mention, I still don't have my money.
This happened in the Rib Mountain Wal-Mart. I had 181.00 dollars to have my taxes filed and I was told I have them on my smart card on 1/27/2012. My card was never good. I went back that Monday and sat from 9:30 am to 4:45 pm waiting on answers where my money was! Then I was told that they messed up my card and I would have to wait until Friday 2/3/2012 and they will cut me a check. Now, today I’m told they can't until whenever? I am very disappointed and I really think people should know how your workers have no clue what they are doing. I am letting you know that I am going to sit at your store at Rib Mountain, WI and tell people how messed up and I hope I cause you all a lot of business problems! I have contacted my own attorney and filing theft charges and fraud due to your workers keep blowing smoke up my **. Hope I get my point across because I’m sure I will in about a hour when I let people at Wal-Mart know what’s up with your people.
I filed my 2010 tax return with them for 150 bucks and nine months later, I'm finding out they never completed the return at all. They were supposed to e-file but since they didn't complete it when they purged the computers at the end of the season, it deleted my file all together so they have no scans at all to re e-file. I owed and sent in my money which was received and even with paperwork to boot. The protocol by federal and state with paperwork when notified of an e-file is to see the paperwork as invalid. So I'm not sure what they did with my paperwork. But apparently, I'm supposed to resupply it which I could have done with copies of the scans Jackson Hewitt was supposed to have, but deleted it. Jackson Hewitt took my money for a job that was never done and gave me a tax headache to clean up to boot as I have to spend half the day on the phone with both departments finding out if they will take a e-file from me or what copies I can provide that are not the ones they acccept originally and so on and so forth.
When I had my taxes prepared, they explained that my RAL would arrive on 02/03/11. Well, when I go to call the office this morning, the receptionist told me it will be after lunch and to try to call back then. I waited until 2:00 pm to call back. The receptionist then states that it will probably be around 8:00 pm like the night before. I called again to give them a phone number to reach me because I will not be home. The manager stated that she hadn't had time to go check the batch that had arrived but will later which was fine. I get a call 10 minutes later from a man that was working there that said my money was not in that batch. I explained to him that I talked with someone earlier and they said it will be around 8:00. He said, "Well, I'm telling you that it may not be until next week." I told him I will call later around 8:00. He said, "No, do not call back here today or night." I was shocked. I wasn't rude nor had I raised my voice but I hung the phone up and called his home office, reported it that it's really bad customer service. I've been with them for 21 years but next year, they will not see me nor will they see anyone from the company I work for. I told everyone how I was treated and that is bad customer service. It's my money. I will call back as many times necessary.
I filed my taxes on 1/21/2012. I went for the RAL so I could get my money back faster. I paid Jackson Hewitt almost $ 400.00 so that I would receive my money in 7 to 13 days. It is now 15 days and I was told so many dates now that I am so confused. Now it is going to be another 3 days. Jackson Hewitt's excuse is that it's the IRS delaying the checks. My issue is I signed a contract with Jackson Hewitt paying them a large amount of money and a service. I was to receive my money in the time line I was told. It has not been that time line. I want to know why do I not get a refund for the service fees? It's a breech of contract and they are making millions. How is this legal? I could have went through TurboTax and not have paid anything. I work hard and this isn't right.
The problem with Jackson Hewitt tax services is that they advertise a refund loan service that can not be provided. This service promises you a loan check in 7-14 business days when waiting for your refund check from the IRS also know as a RAL. Well, the problem with this service is the government sends the check to Jackson Hewitt when you sign over your check to them. The loan from Jackson is supposed to come before your government check but I looked up on the IRS website and Jackson Hewitt has already received my check from the government direct deposit but has not paid out my money that I charged over $400.00 for. It sounds and looks like they are taking my money from the IRS less the loan fees and pay back amount out of my check reallocating the money to me. This is a fraud and something will be done about it.
I filed my taxes on Jan 12th, 2012 and they said that I would have my refund back in 7-13 days. I'm on my 14th day, and still nothing. When I called to ask them, they always have attitude with you about it, like it is their money. Why is that? I got my state taxes on the 26th of Jan, and they said the rest of your refund will be here tomorrow. It's been a week, since last time they told me that, and it's still not here either. When I called them yesterday, they said anybody who had filed their taxes before the 26th of January, that they will have their refunds on the 3rd of Feb. Now, when I called, they told me the 8th, so which one is it next year? I will not go back to them. They are nothing but liars. There are people out here who need their money for bills and transportation, and other things too, and all they do is put you on a runaround.
I came into the office for the first time, thinking that I would have a nice experience, and get a faster service, then H&R Block, and this was so not true. After hearing that I will receive my taxes back faster, and they will get me more money. I called the IRS, and they stating that my refund was rejected, and I was not notified. I am very frustrated.
I filed my taxes on January 26, 2012. I was called on Feb. 3rd, and was told to come back into the office, because some information was wrong. On Feb. 3rd, I was told the information did not match. When I called the office, the manager had keyed my daughter's name in wrong. Every time I ask what the problem is, he gives me some ** about people trying to cheat them. I think they are trying to cheat me. I have been going to H&R Block for over 20 years, and I will be returning next year.
On 1/26/12, I filed a RAL with Jackson Hewitt. They told me I would have my check direct deposited into my checking account. I went to the bank and the money was not there. I went back to the office where I filed and they said the check was at my bank. I told them I just came from there and it wasn't there. I was quite angry at this point and the lady said to me, "well what are you going to do about it?" She proceeded to call the police and have me escorted out. After 2 days of calling and complaining, the manager returned my call and said my money was deposited the next day. She asked me my routing number to my account and I gave it to her. She said that wasn't the one they had on my return. The idiot preparer used an old account from last year. She never even typed in the new one I gave her. They said the money was deposited into someone else's account and it would be at least a week before they could figure it out. I told them I wanted a refund for the tax prep fees and they would only give me half back and that would be at least 2-4 weeks before I see that. The people were not only rude but incompetent. Last time I will ever go there and will definitely report them to the BBB.
Basically, this is the same thing that everyone else is stating. It’s just shocking to me that this could even be legal! They are stealing money. I filed my taxes at Jackson Hewitt and was told that I would have my check within 24 hrs. Then I received a call saying that the computer kicked me out the system for the RAL and that I had to wait 7-10 days to receive my check. What I do not understand is why do I still have to pay $350 if I am not getting rapid refund? So angry because people work hard for the little money they do make for someone to take it away from you and nothing can be done about it.
The reason i went to Jackson Hewitt this year (2012) is that I was in a hardship. I filled out my own income tax papers every year. i needed to get my money rapidly. I even explained this to the guy helping, their service was okay, even though I spent two hours there. He should have explain to me that it would take more then 7 days. I should have filed them myself online, and not pay $250, which was supposed to make processing faster. Never will I go back, and I sure will let everybody, who gets in my way, know. Do not stop there. I will even do your taxes for free, or will show you how to get them done free, and get direct deposit within 7 days. Jackson Hewitt is stealing our money.
Oh, this people are terrible. First the staff is not prepared whatsoever. I did my taxes, it took 4 hours because the girl helping me did not know at all what she was doing. She had to make 20 phone calls to ask questions. I paid $320.00 to get my taxes back in 8-15 days. Well my state refund was screwed up, it was supposed to be deposited into my account. Well it never did, they ended up getting the check instead and didn't even bothered calling me to let me know it was sitting there for 3 days. Now, my federal?! Another issue, apparently it was deposited into my account yesterday, they say. I checked my card balance and it says zero. I called them but they said it's in there. I called the bank, they said that my refund was rejected from my card which I'm not sure why if i got charged $20 to get Jackson Hewitt's smart card. So the lady I spoke to from the bank said to go to where I did them and they should have a printout check for me. I went there today and another lady helped me (another non-prepared tax person). She has no idea what to tell me, doesn't know where my money is, and has no guidance whatsoever. All I have to say is that I still haven't gotten my money. This is ridiculous, terrible system- non-professional at all. Right now, I'm just hoping someone will call tomorrow and tell me where my money is. I will never do my taxes with Jackson Hewitt ever again and will never recommend them to anyone!
My 24-year old son went there, and, boy, did they take advantage of him. They didn’t even give him a price first (unfortunately he assumed it would be comparable). They sat him down, entered his $20 interest from the bank, and ONE W-2 and 10 minutes later charged him $200. No kids, No house, No deductions, single—$200! What do you think? My accountant used to charge him $50. At least go to H&R Block. My other teenagers went there for less than $50. My kids are learning there are a lot of crooks out there.
I went in on Saturday 1/28/12 to file my taxes. I was told they would contact me within 24/48 hrs to receive my RAL. Well Monday came along with no call, Tuesday no call. I finally went to the office and they told me I was approved for the RAL and I would have to contact the IRS to see when I would receive my refund. ** I could have done this all myself and I wouldn't have cost me almost $400 in fees just to file. Jackson Hewitt is just a big rip off.
In the past, I have not had any gripes with Jackson & Hewitt. Last year, I used Turbo tax and I really wish I would have done the same this year. I filed with Jackson & Hewitt on 1/18/12 and it takes 7-10 business days. I have called 3 times to check the status of my refund and I keep getting a different story. First, I am told IRS computer system crashed so I am looking at Monday or Tuesday. I called Tuesday. I am told Wednesday or Thursday. Today is Wednesday now I am told Friday. I finally decided to check my refund status at irs.gov. The site tells me 2/7/12. I really wish I would stop getting all these different answers regarding my return. What was the point of me paying all this money to get my return quicker? I could have spent less doing Turbo and probably would have gotten my refund a lot quicker.
Wow. So years down the line I see that someone was ripped off by Jackson Hewitt just like I was. I think it was in 2007 or 2008 but the JH that was in the Wal-Mart in Alexandria, VA did the same exact thing: I was told I would get a call in a few hours to pick up my check, got no call. Then I called and was told to call back because they didn’t have a status yet. Long story short I didn’t get my refund for days, maybe even two weeks, they still deducted the $400 for the same day refund and when I finally got someone to tell me my check was ready they said, Your check has been here since the day you came in. I don’t know why someone told you it wasn’t here. It’s even dated for the same day you came in. Talk about pissed. And the manager kept saying, I know my staff messed up but there’s nothing I can do about it. Never again, have I or will I use JH. And I’ve let all of my friends and family know how they blatantly ripped me off. You don’t neglect to tell someone at 5 times that their check is ready unless you were doing it on purpose.
I had a very simple tax return. I thought anyway. So I took my total of two W-2 forms and my bank statement showing my interest on my savings account .Where I made my mistake was thinking since Jack-Hew was located in the local Wally World store that it would be cheap or at least reasonably priced. After the person was through preparing them I was told about the charge of $125.00. I almost ** myself. I will never let this happen again. Nothing is cheap anymore. Advice to others: don’t go to Jackson Hewitt to get your taxes done.
The only reason I went to Jackson Hewitt was because my boyfriend went there in the past and he has never had problems, up until this encounter. I have never been so irritated in my life! I waited a good hour and a half waiting. There were only 2 tax people there. They only had 2 people each (in front of me). When I finally got a chance to sit down with someone, she immediately sat me, answered her cell phone and walked in the back of the office. I was so upset already. She was interrupted again, answering her cell phone in the middle of preparing my taxes, typing with one hand. I'm surprised if my information was entered correctly. This whole process took no more than 10 minutes to enter all my information. If this is the case, why did I have to wait more than an hour and a half waiting?! I will never return to Jackson Hewitt. They have such low scale staff. You should see what some of the employees were wearing and how they acted. Who answers their cell phone in the middle of preparing taxes?! How rude!
I called Jackson Hewitt on 1/29/12 and was told that my fed refund will be there on 1/30/12 and sure enough it wasn’t there. I called back today since it is 1/31/12 and they said I won’t be getting my fed refund until 01/8/12. I questioned the lady there and she wasn’t sure why someone told me that date because in their system its saying 1/8/12 and if I’m not happy about it, I need to call Republic Bank because they are the one printing the checks. Never go to JH, they are a bunch of **. So much of paying $404.00 when you can’t even get your refund within 7-13 days like what they say and oh yeah, they won’t refund or lower your fees to you too.
I went to file my taxes and clearly the young girl had not been properly trained. I wanted to file for the AR and the RAL, she couldn’t get the RAL go through and she said I didn’t qualify. My return went through, it wouldn’t send either. So she called the other lady, who she said was on her way back from Wal-Mart, and we waited until she got there. She said it had to be sent from the main computer. So my return went through, I think, not being filed the way I wanted it. The only explanation was "sorry, these things are stupid." I assume she meant the computers. I'll go back to H&R Block next year.
I called on 1/30/2012. I was told my check would be released on 1/31/2012. I checked on the status of my refund on the 31st and was told it would be released on 2/7/2012. As much money as I’m paying to have it filed electronically, it is ridiculous if I was going to have to wait this long on my tax refund. I could have saved money and done it myself. My family and I will never use Jackson Hewitt again. If I can’t be made somewhat of a happy customer when you are told one thing one day and something else the very next day really makes you wonder who is really at fault getting the run around. I don’t like it.
Jackson Hewitt did my taxes for the year of 2009. I went into the office with 3 w2s the employee told me there was no need to file the last one because I didn’t make enough money. So, I, believing her, went along with it so now 2012, I ended up owing IRS $600 and state $400 and I tell one of the "Head" people about this and she’s in denial stating they teach all their employees to file all w2s. I mean seriously, the girl that prepared my taxes skipped that part of class. I was a faithful customer for about 10yrs but after this Jackson Hewitt and their well taught employees can kiss my ***. Thanks Jackson Hewitt, you lead me to a real "professional" who knows what she’s doing.
I have been a customer with Jackson Hewitt for several years, until this year. I have not had any issues with them, I will say after my experience, I will never go back and will never refer anyone to them. I was told that my AR tax prep was a "loan" from Orchard Bank. I have has almost $300 in fees taken out of my refund check, all to find out that I will not get my money until the IRS deposits the refund into Orchard Bank. My question is what did I pay for? I could have done this for free online! And good luck getting someone to call you back and answer your questions, every person in the office I have talked to is full of ***! I have informed the IRS about this issue as I consider it fraud and false advertising. I have also called the corporate office that also did no good. Please be aware, do not file your taxes with Jackson Hewitt, it is a waste of your hard earned money!
Rude, unprofessional office manager by the name Ms. Price. Interrupting, loud and rude to fellow employees. She also stated "the IRS is not always right". I have never been treated so poorly as if I was an ignorant peon. I will not return.
When I went to Jackson Hewitt, I went with my last check stub. I had called another Jackson Hewitt office and I asked her if they would be able to download my W-2 off of the internet. She checked and said "yes, it was ready". When I went in there, I told them what I wanted to do and the receptionist acted like I was crazy. She called the head tax preparer or supervisor or whatever she was and told her what I wanted to do. The lady began going on for about 20 minutes on whether it was a possibility they could be ready and they may not be. I told her it was an ADP check stub and more than likely it was ready. After this long unneeded debate, she sent me to the desk of an inexperienced tax preparer who was in the process of training. We went through the whole process and what do you know? My W-2 was ready to be downloaded. During the process, they passed up on a state tax credit that boosted my stated refund by 436 dollars. Had I not caught what she was doing, I would not have gotten it. So after everything was said and done a week later, they called me and told me that IRS had sent a letter stating that they were keeping my entire refund for back owed taxes and now they would not get their fees and I had better come in there and make arrangements to pay them. I called IRS and this was not the case. I owed $949 and my refund amount was $5600. I had over 4300 dollars coming back. I went in to the office and told them what IRS said and she said, "well, I have seen this before and it will be six months before you receive your refund". Once again, I called the treasury department and they told me that is absolutely not true and my money would be ready during normal processing time. These are the most unprofessional people ever and I will not ever deal with them again.
Well, the preparer got help over and over yet didn't get my taxes right. After having them rechecked and returning to show the big difference they did nada. I was told different things by several people. I still have many questions. I have called to see if check was in and whoever didn’t. I’m disgusted.
I have been dealing with Jackson Hewitt in Houma, LA for 15 years. Each time going in, I request the same person. I have never had a bad experience. Sometimes I have to wait because the requested person is helping someone else but I sit and wait for my turn. I don't believe it is the company itself that makes the visit but the person you get and how much they know.
We have been to Jackson Hewitt at Charlotte, NC. We had a long wait and she prepared the taxes and we did not like the amount she quoted as she did not do it properly. We had to pay $25 for not filing with them and she made me to wait for 60 min to take the money. Overall, I wasted three hours time and 25 bucks with these people and had to bear their rudeness. They never wrote it in their office about it and a small sticker was there on the desk and she told about the fee in the middle of conversation. We could not go from there as we are nice people and it is ridiculous to charge a fee when we are not filing a return.
I am a father of 5, my wife stays at home and cares for our children. I work full-time. I was expecting 3 W2's, I got them all on the 26th of January 2012. We have rent due on the 1st so I thought perhaps we should go for the RAL loan. I usually do my taxes using Turbo Tax and pay a $70.00 fee but being we needed our money so badly I thought I would ask the preparer in Walmart about the loan. She lured me in stating she has never seen anyone get turned down for the RAL saying "it's rare" and that even if we didn't get it, we would get our taxes back within 3-5 days. Well so I thought I could live with 3-5 days, so we used Jackson Hewitt service. Well not only did we not qualify for the RAL, the preparer input my social wrong so there was a day's delay. On top of that, we were told it will take 10-17 days to get the money! Wow, I could have saved myself $380.00 and did them myself and got the same refund time using e-file with TurboTax! What a racket Jackson Hewitt is bad! Do not use Jackson Hewitt, stay away from them, far away!
I had my taxes prepared, and I paid extra money to get my tax returns back early. The contract I agreed on, was tax returns, was supposed to be loaded onto my Hewitt Jackson prepaid debit card. I made several attempts by phone. Finally, on my final attempt, I did some impersonation to find out where my tax returns would be available. To my disbelief, I was told by the management it would be after the signed, agreed. The contract date also told it's not their problem. I'll get my refund, when it comes totally disregarding prior to the contract being signed. It is a scam, so Jackson Hewitt can make money off of people. I signed a contract that I would receive my tax returns 7-13 days after my taxes was filed that day. I did not receive what was agreed on under contract, but was told it was not their problem. They got paid extra for this service. I'm plodding out not only from not receiving what I paid extra for. I'm losing the extra money for a service not done.
Well, maybe we should start fighting back with brute force. If we can be fair and just to Uncle Sam and the middleman can ** us through Uncle Sam, maybe we should cut out the middle man. I love my Uncle Sam but if the tax preparer can cause such heartache maybe we should really consider 86ing.
I called yesterday, 01/25/12, and spoke with Sharon who advised that if I made an appointment that I would not have to wait in line the next day. After working all day and picking my 1 yr old up from daycare, we headed over to get our taxes done. To no surprise I walked in and of course there were already folks being helped at both cubicles they have set up. I walk over to their check-in stand, told the guy that I had an appointment. He confirmed that he saw me down for 4 pm, asked that I fill out some paperwork and sit down by the Walmart bathrooms. I filled my paperwork out, turned it in, was told that one of the tax reps was almost done and I would be seen in 5 minutes. My daughter and I went back and had a seat, looking at the watch (as my child began to get a little bored). 5 minutes turned to 10, 10 to 20 then 35 minutes passed. I thought, well, maybe I should go ahead and do some quick shopping and that will help pass the time. Nope. I came back and the two people that were there getting their taxes done were the same two people that were there when I first got there. I called the main office, asking for another location that wasn't as busy and was advised to head over to the Mesa Ridge location. I said sure. I asked the check-in person for my paper work back at which he replied, "Ma'am, please don't leave; our tax rep is almost done; she needs to scan one more document and that's it." I said, "I really don't have any more time to waste; my daughter is getting antsy and I have already an hour so far." I was told again, "She is almost done, ma'am; please just give us one more minute." So once again, I was standing around, with my child who is climbing the walls at this point. Finally the couple that I had been waiting to get done, gets up and walks out the doors of the store. I then took my daughter out of the cart, sat my purse in the opposite chair to pull out my paper work so I could make sure the tax rep had all my stuff she would need, at which point the tax rep leans over and tells me "Ma'am I need you to get up. I'm not done with the other customer yet, you can't sit there". I was livid! I have never been treated this way in my entire life(!) and when I asked that I get my paperwork back that had all my personal information on it, I was told that I could not have it back as that was now their company property. As I stormed away, the manager comes and asked was there anything he could do, a little to late for me. I will never ever use this tax service again and how they treat people I would not recommend them to anyone. They don't value the customer, period. And as much money as I paid to them through the years, you think I would be treated at least with some kind of respect.
My company is a sign manufacturing company and we were contacted by an employee of Jackson-Hewitt by the name Christy ** from Vienna Illinois office. We were hired to fabricate a sign for the office of Jackson Hewitt located in Hopkinsville, KY, as approved by Cheryl **. Sign was made an installed on Jan. 6th of 2011, we were told payment would be sent in 2 days, today is now Jan. 26 2011 a payment has not been remitted. I have tried numerous times to contact the employee from Jackson-Hewitt that gave the orders for sign to be made for the Hopkinsville office but no response has been returned, voice mail has been all that has been allowed, if this is how Jackson Hewitt employees are allowed to behave, I’m sure not going to let anyone from that company do business with myself or give any references to others for this is the worse professionalism from one of the most prestigious company. If this letter gets to anyone that can assist to resolve this matter it would greatly appreciated otherwise other actions must be taken.
I filed my taxes with Jackson Hewitt on January 9, 2011. I went for the refund anticipation loan that you are to receive in 1 to 5 days. Apparently, it didn't work out that way for me. I have yet to receive my money, and it is January 26 now, yet Jackson Hewitt still charged me $405.00 for a service they didn't give me, and the tax preparer made a mistake on form as far as my 401k is concerned, and that is why my refund is being held up, but when I tried to get answers, but nobody wanted to talk about it, to me or with me. Their commercial is so right, "this how we do it". Yes, we rip the public off, and we don't give a ** about your situation. Jackson Hewitt needs to be shut down. They are very unprofessional, and don't have a clue about and don't even care about the working class people in America. They know we are vulnerable now, with the economy, the way it is, and they took advantage. What a heartless business! Enjoy the low life while you can, Jackson Hewitt. One thing I do know is God does not like dishonesty, especially when you do it with a smile.
I went to pick up my tax refund. Angel told me there was someone to cash my check for me inside of Jackson Hewitt. He took $510.00 out of my check and she set it up. There is more.
I went to Jackson Hewitt located on Devon Ave in Lincolnwood, IL last year. Peter prepared my taxes. He was very rude to me. After doing my taxes at H & R block this year, I found out that Peter made several mistakes. I am very disappointed and will never return to Jackson Hewitt. I now owe the state of IL money due to Peter's mistake. Jackson Hewitt will never get my business again and it is a shame that I paid them to be so rude to me. It is a shame that some people in this world have no respect for others and the people at the Jackson Hewitt office on Devon Ave in Lincolnwood IL make me really wonder what our world is coming to.
The woman at the table had lured me in by lying to me in stages about the fees I would pay for the service. It was a simple 1 job W2 and bank interest. The price started at $58, went to $148, $159 and after signing at the end, I was reading I owed $228 and she told me also my wife's taxes were covered in the beginning and at the end changed her tune. I feel I was scammed out of 130 plus dollars. I will not use their service or recommend them to anyone. I would consider myself lucky if I actually get my return in the mail. Why did I go ? Because it was easy in middle of Walmart. It's over now but this woman lies like a rug.
I went to Jackson Hewitt thinking that it was going to be a great experience for me. But instead, it was hell. When I went to file my taxes, the first guy put all of my information in the computer for a quote. The second visit, a lady put in the additional information from my W-2 in. She was on her cellular phone while completing my paperwork, talking to her boyfriend that she loves so much. She had to call some company to get a referral number, during that, the person asked for my name. She had my drivers license in front of her and still spelled my name wrong. I had to correct her on that. When she finally got off of the phone, I asked her if I could apply for the Instant Loan that they had. I got approved but my name was spelled wrong. I didn't find out that my name was spelled wrong until another lady called me from the office about the check. She told me that they were going to correct it. When my father made it up there to pick up my check, it was ready. I called the office the next day and the check still wasn't ready. Now, this was suppose to be a "get your check within 48 hours". I kept calling and calling but they still claim that they don't know what's going on. The lady from the front office called me and said that they needed a copy of my drivers license, in which they should had gotten when I first filed my returns. So I couldn't fax it because they don't have a fax machine. Another lie, the guy told me; your check will be ready in four hours. When I gave them a copy of my license, I ask them are you sure that it will be only be four hours. They complied, yes.... My check was still not ready. I asked for a customer service number and they gave me a number that is just an automated system. I called them back and the lady at the front desk stated "well that's the number that we have been using." I told her that it wasn't so, she said that they have a person that they go through and still until this day, I don't have that number. It has been 2 weeks and I still haven't received my funding. The lady that was on the phone was very unprofessional. Gave me my tax return papers without an envelop, sent my taxes to the IRS without asking me if I wanted my check to come to there office or through direct deposit. So I have to pay $91.00 for bank fee, plus there fee for them to give me my check, and the $61.00 because I wanted to get the instant loan in which, I still haven't got. So no, I wouldn't advise anyone to go to Jackson Hewitt.
I was calling to ask questions on what would be the best way to file for me and my so called husband that we’re separated but not divorced and still have same the address but don't live together. I did call a few times asking different questions on what we could do or can't do to get the best way. The lady there, I guess the lady in charge, told me that she was going to tell me to use someone else, because I was acting like I was dishonest and was going to do bad! Atkins is a small town for her to work here in your office to be saying and implying something not good about someone. I took offense to this and her tone and words. I wasn't so nice I did call the Russellville office. A person is supposed to call me but this hasn't happened! I went from filing at H&R block to you guys on a request from a friend that uses you all. But if that's the way you all run business, then I can go back to H&R block or do them myself on line at Turbo to save money and get great results. If there isn't nothing done about this woman, I will process legal actions against her and your company for the way I was treated by just asking questions to figure out what to do and what's legal in filing taxes. I do have a big mouth and know lots of people. And I will let them know how I was treated by her. I'm sorry but that was wrong of her to do that. And I was wrong for yelling at her but she made me that way.
I would like to know who I need to talk to about my disappointment with Jackson Hewitt's tax preparer. I had my taxes prepared in a Walmart kiosk and the preparer was not only late for my appointment, she had some of her friends stop by to deliver some diet pills and "chat". She stopped three times while doing my taxes! And now I am getting a letter from the IRS stating that I owe money due to an error in my tax return. She checked a box on my State Retirement that was not supposed to be checked and I owe almost $1,000 because of her error. After checking with my local 12-month office, I found out that she also did not take the Jackson-Hewitt guarantee for my refund. I did not realize that until they explained it, but I do remember your tax preparer telling me something about not needing a guarantee since it already contained a guarantee. She did make a copy of the IRS letter and generated a check for $26 for the "interest" they charged. Their preparer's mistake cost me almost $1,000. And the preparer told me that I wouldn't need the guarantee because my taxes were simple with no major deductions.
I filed with Jackson Hewitt for 2 years and I thought I was in good hands but I wasn’t. The year 2010, Jackson sold my son’s social security number to somebody who needed a child to put on their taxes so they can get some money back. And I didn’t know they sold him until January 30, the day I went to do my income tax. They told me that their system showed that he was already filed for and I said that’s not possible because I’m doing my tax now and they said that I couldn’t put him on my tax because someone already did. And I thought it was their dad but it wasn’t him because he doesn’t work so he doesn’t get taxes. Jackson Hewitt said to me that it was some one here because it’s already in the system. Then she tried to tell me that they fired everyone that used to work there and it is under new management. I want to get them shut down because that should have never happened.
Now I owe the IRS because JH falsified my information. I have been going to Jackson Hewitt since 2008. A friend referred me to them and said that she received $6000 in a tax refund. I never had a regular full time job that paid half way decent, so I never filed taxes. When I went to Jackson Hewitt my first refund was almost $1200, but on top of that they took almost $400 for fees. This year I received a letter from the IRS stating that I owed them money from tax year 2009. I called the IRS and stated that I filed my taxes for that year and I handed in all my W2 forms. I then contacted JH and of course I did not get an answer. I began to look through my tax returns for that year and not only did I discover that they didn’t file all of my tax information for the only W2 they decided to file but they reported the numbers from that W2 incorrectly. They falsified my numbers and now I owe the IRS. I have someone looking over my tax return for that year, but what I think I may do is just understand how to do taxes by hand so that I can get all of my money and not have to worry about mistakes.
I had used JH when I lived in Maryland so I used it in Marion, NC (at a Wal-Mart location here). It took the man a long time to complete. When it was all finished, he charged $210, more than I had ever paid. I told him about the move. He didn't mention I could get money because of the move. I waited some time for the refund and it didn't come. I finally called IRS and they had no record of a filing! I called JH and was told to go to Morganton (20 miles away). The woman at that tax office gave me a disc with my info and told me to take it someplace else. I was fed up and took it to another tax preparer who understood my problem with JH and filed it free. I was able to claim the move and it turned out better.
I understand your complaint. I do not work for JH. I do manage another company and if you email me at **@gmail.com, I am in the Dallas area and could look over your return for free. I am just curious with that amount of refund; it tells me you had a very complex return. So a JH at Wal-Mart wasn’t the best place to a return of that magnitude done. Though I have worked for the major tax refund prep companies in past years, a few things have always bothered me—training of employees and also mis-education of clients. True, most offer classes a few months before tax season. But as a trainer of those classes, most students turned employees couldn’t do a tax return without software aiding them. Ask them to do it on paper and you’re **. It’s data entry to most people and that’s it. Companies like JH take advantage of the mis-education of clients because if you know how to properly prepare your taxes, why would you pay a company like JH the money they charge? A CPA would charge way less, by the way. Most tax companies are like cockroaches; come December they all come out and feed. I was available to the point where my clients have my personal cell and home number in case a mistake was made or a check came in after season which always happens. With RALs being harder to access due to debt indicators being taken away from banks, it’s getting riskier for banks to approve these loans, which means a higher bank fee forwarded to consumer. I don’t offer them because I, as a preparer, can not always give the client a straight forward answer as to denial in most cases and that is not acceptable in any office I am at. If you made under 50000, you do have the option of getting it done for free online or through your local workforce commission; your preparer is obligated to tell you this as well. You can also do it over the phone. It takes time but almost worth it.
I filed my taxes, the preparer had to make 4 phone calls to ask questions about what he was doing. I was told the price would be $68. When he was done and filed everything, it went to $210. He called and they discounted to about $140. I watched him bring out a bunch of papers and put them in an envelope as I watch my previous preparer do every year. I was given a code to enter into their website to check on my taxes. I never thought anything of it till going back to school. Now I checked my envelope, it's nothing but frigging coupons. I tried to enter my code to bring a copy for school, the code is incorrect. I called the office,I need to go clear across town to get my copies, The office is open from 1pm to 6pm they say. I have an appointment with the school at 2pm. I stopped at their office at 1:15pm. It was closed, there were no lights on. By now I'm fuming. I called and left a message. I stopped back after my meeting at 3pm, it was still closed and lights were out. I called the 1-800 number online for customer service. The lady explained that they franchise the offices and all she can do is file a complaint with that office's manager, who I already spoke with and will not return my calls. So I asked her if there's no someone that monitors how these offices perform? She said no. So to the guy that tried to defend Jackson Hewitt, you're wrong! If Jackson Hewitt cared about customer service, they would monitor these satellite offices for complaints. It's very obvious they don't care about customer service at all.
Jackson Hewitt is a scam and do not care about returning customers. Me and My wife did our taxes here for years. Now my wife is going for her bachelor's degree and she is having trouble with here financial aide because Jackson Hewitt did not put her work study W-2 in with our taxes. How do you have a guarantee that is not honored? The preparer was not accurate and now Jackson Hewitt wants to charge us $139 for something they screwed up. The preparer told us that since we are from New Jersey and didn't spend our money with them (Orlando, Florida Jackson Hewitt 2500 Kirkman Rd. ) we have to pay. What!! We are never going back again. Thanks for not helping us. I am also a United States Army Veteran, not just some trash on the street like that guy made us feel. Scam artists, not getting my $400 this year.
I am defending some franchises and the company. I have been reading over quite a few of these "complaints" and while I agree that some of you have been misinformed by the franchise you went to, you can't blame the company as a whole for this. I am sorry that you had a bad experience with the franchise but again, that doesn't mean that all franchises operate the same way. I have been an employee of a Jackson Hewitt Franchise for 15 years and we have to take classes every year due to all the tax law changes, etc. Unfortunately, some franchises don't train their preparers correctly. But some of you, with your "complaints," come on. Now, to quote a few: "I have been a customer with them from 2000-2010. I always thought that they were charging too much. They never want to itemize your expenses. I think your return could have been larger. They always want to get you out. The service is bad. I have four children. I think that I should have gotten more to take care of my children." Are you serious? They don't want to itemize, well, maybe your tax situation doesn't warrant itemizing. You "think" that the refund should be larger, well, if you think so, then why aren't you a tax preparer? And the funniest part of your quote was that you think that you should have been paid more to care for your children? Jackson Hewitt is supposed to be paying you to take care of your children? Hilarious. To quote another: "I filed my taxes as I did every year with two measly returns and three dependents. I expected the same treatment as always. Next day, direct deposit, simple form, no itemizing. Imagine my surprise when this year, I didn't qualify for a next day return! No reason other than they switched from one bank to another and this bank didn't consider me qualified." How is this Jackson Hewitt's fault? You even said it in your quote, "the bank didn't qualify you." It's not up to Jackson Hewitt or their employees who gets the loans from the bank--that's the bank's decision, another hilarious one. The next one is quite the large quote so I'm not going to re-post it. But her problem was (yet again with the bank, not JH personally) that her state refund came before her Federal and Jackson Hewitt took the money from her State refund resulting in overdraft fees, when she had written checks assuming her Federal would be deposited first. Well first of all, and you can ask plenty of people, you can't always count on the exact date of when you will receive your Federal refund. We give an estimate as we can't control the IRS either. So writing checks based on an estimated time of a deposit is not Jackson Hewitt's fault that you overdrafted your account. And it is quite possible for your State refund to come before your Fed (may even be reasons for you not to see your Fed refund). But to clarify, when you sign the paperwork to have your fees taken out of your refund, you are yet again signing with the bank ( that's why in most cases there is a fee; it's the bank's fee). So she claimed that Jackson Hewitt took her State refund to pay her fees back, well not them primarily, but the bank took whatever refund came in first to pay the necessary fees (tax prep and bank fee). But again, it is hilarious that you'd write checks and pay places before even having money in your account. Now the last one I'm going to quote has the same scenario: a franchise issue. She went to a different JH. Then, the franchise her brother went to was offering RAL's ( refund "anticipation" loans). You see? Even in our abbreviation, we only anticipate your refund coming and offer you a loan through the bank. If the money is owed elsewhere and IRS takes it, plain and simple, you owe the bank back and JH for doing your taxes since the IRS didn't send any refund to the bank to pay back the loan they gave you. Anyway, she went somewhere else and even was told upon walking in the door that the franchise she was in didn't offer the RAL, but she stayed and did the AR ( anticipated refund). Did you notice the wording? We again cannot predict--only estimate and anticipate when the IRS will send it. But again, she didn't receive it in the allotted 8-15 days and now is trashing JH for an IRS issue. Hilarious. For most of the rest of you (and as I have said, I am sorry for some that have had actual bad experiences causing you more money loss then expected, I wish you had went to a better franchise), look seriously at your complaints. You were upset with paying X amount of money and not receiving the RAL. Well, it seems that if you had received the RAL from the bank, you certainly wouldn't have minded it than to pay those fees you're complaining about (since you were told before hand what the fees are).
My 2007 tax return was found on the street along with hundreds of others done by Jackson Hewitt. Neither the local office nor headquarters cares in the least that my private information - name, address, social security, work info., bank account information was there for anyone to take. Jackson Hewitt is an identity thief's dream come true. Read the SF Chronicle article. You won't believe it
A girl filed our taxes for 2008 and she filled them out wrong and we had to pay back $2500.00 to Federal and $256 to state all for her mistake. We questioned her on it and she also said we didn't need the Gold guarantee because it was a straight forward tax form and she told us there were no problems with it. Then the next year, we got a paper from the IRS stating that we owed this money and I call Jackson Hewitt. They told me it was my problem and we had to pay the money back. They said they fired the girl that did it because we weren't the only one she had done like that. That big mistake that was made put me in a financial bind and they did not care at all; it wasn't money coming out of their pocket. I had to have them take it out of my check each week. That and all the other deductions coming out, you have nothing left to pay your other bills and this **. All because of a mistake from an incompetent person who didn't care that she was messing with other peoples' lives.
Jackson Hewitt made a mistake in preparing my taxes for '09. When she told me I was getting back almost $8,000, I questioned her and she told me it was right. She also told me it would be reviewed before submission, so no worries about mistakes. She was wrong. I now owe the IRS over $3500 for her mistake. When calling and trying to get to the bottom of it, I got the runaround. It was hard to get a return call from anyone. I was laid off this year and am having a hard time making ends meet. Jackson Hewitt caused a tremendous hardship for me and my family. I do owe the money and will pay it, plus penalties, because I own up to my mistakes and obligations. I just wish Jackson Hewitt worked on the same philosophy. When I got on this site and read all the complaints, a lot similar to mine, I was sickened.
They told me I owed $16,000 on my 2008 tax return. I talked to them about it and they said they were not responsible for the errors. I had to start paying the $16,000 plus interest and have been fighting with them ever since. Please help me!
The tax preparer made several errors on my taxes. Jackson Hewitt stated that they were not responsible for taking care of this matter with the IRS. I owe $9,434.77 to the IRS. I paid for the gold guarantee and they are refusing to pay my claim, and I really need to know why.
I had my taxes prepared in Sept 2011, four weeks ago in the Dublin, TX office. I moved to Burleson and made several phone calls to Jackson Hewitt to forward me via mail my tax return. After dozens of phones calls, finally I talked to a live person. I was told that the check was printed and sitting on a desk waiting to be mailed. Two weeks later, still no check. I have been calling every Jackson Hewitt Tax Office number I can find. I have talked to 4 different people who all said they would see where it was printed and would confirm and get back to me. So far, no one has ever called me back.
On February 6, 2009, I went to Jackson Hewitt Tax Service in a Walmart store to have my income taxes prepared. On February 16, I was called to pick up my tax refund check. The refund was very large, but I was told that my return had been checked by the main office and that everything was correct. However, in June of this year, I received a letter from the IRS indicating that my return was prepared with over 10 errors! As a result, I was responsible for paying back the IRS over $29,000! When I received the first letter from the IRS, I notified Jackson Hewitt (Peggy **, GM). She was extremely rude, disrespectful, degrading, and judgmental towards me. Blaming me for the errors on my return, as well as lying by stating she had contacted me several times about amending my return. After 4 months of meeting with Peggy **, GM, I finally was paid from the Gold Guarantee I had purchased at the time of my tax preparation. I received the full amount of $5,000. However, the $5,000 was for the errors Jackson Hewitt made on my return. But the Accuracy Guarantee, which covers the interest and penalties for the errors on my return was not paid in full. The interest & penalties at this time is $1,432.23. Peggy ** gave me a check for $241.60 and refuses to give me any more for the following reasons: She claims I did not submit form 1099R at the time of preparation. Also claims she did an amended return on February 19 and I didn't pick it up after repeated phone calls to me. Her claims are untrue! I have proof that I did submit form 1099R at the time of tax preparation. According to my phone records, I never at any time received any phone calls from Peggy ** or anyone at Jackson Hewitt notifying me of an amended return, nor was it ever mailed to me. The first time I got the amended return was at the first meeting I had with Peggy ** on June 30, 2011. Efforts to reach the owner, Linda Whittington (sent certified letter and called her office) have went unanswered. I accept full responsibility for cashing the check (I am working with the IRS to pay it back). However, I believe in all fairness the Accuracy Guarantee should be honored to the full amount based on the fact that Jackson Hewitt made many mistakes on my tax return. Also, if the Gold Guarantee did not find me at fault for the mistakes made on my return, the Accuracy Guarantee should also be honored to the fullest.
In 2009, I worked in WV and WV alone. My residence is in NC and I work as a construction worker. Jackson Hewitt prepared my taxes in 2009 and he didn't file state taxes for NC. In 2011, the State of NC sent me a letter showing that I owe NC over $2,000,00. I went to Jackson Hewitt and gave them the notice from NC state tax department. It's been three weeks now and NC put a freeze on a checking account which my dad and I have. I don't deposit any money in the account. My dad started the checking account and added me so that if something would happen to him the State couldn't take the money. I contacted Walter ** the manager of Jackson Hewitt tax service, who is handling my 2009 taxes. I told him what the deal was and all he has to do is fax the 2009 w-2 to NC so that they can see I had payed into WV state taxes and they can take the freeze off of my Dad's checking account. It's been three days now, Walter have yet to fax the w-2s to NC state tax. NC will take the money from my father's checking account. On the 19th of Aug if they don't receive my w-2s. I will never let Jackson Hewitt prepare my taxes again!
This has got to be one of the worst experiences ever! The environment was small and dirty, the preparers are not up to date on tax rules and changes. They made errors on my return which created a headache and major delay. They refused to take responsibility and they behaved unprofessionally. They mailed my return to the incorrect address and it was then returned back to them. They will not take my call or tell me the location of my return. I am not sure how these folks are even in business, I cannot be the only one they have done dirty. Oh, BTW, I filed the last week of January and charged for rapid return, and all-here it is May and I still have not seen my return and they are refusing any type of reimbursement for such poor services and inconvenience. You will be better off buying TurboTax and doing it yourself! I have used JHewitt for the past 10+ years and will never consider using any location ever again.
I filed my taxes through Jackson Hewitt on 28 Mar 11. I have not received my fund yet. I tried to contact them so many times but their office is closed. I called many a times on the number (305-227-4100) given to me with my file, but no one answers or replies to my voice mails. I called the Jackson Hewitt's main help line (1-800-234-1040). I was told that they cannot help because I filed taxes in Miami and they do not have access to my information. I was told to contact the office and I explained to them that I did so several times but no one replies and no one is there. They gave me a complaint number and told me that someone will call me back. But no one called and it has been around two weeks now. I paid $142.
I got my taxes done for 2009 and nobody notified me of my state tax return. When I went this year to get my taxes done, I asked them how much I owed because I thought the government took my taxes last year. They informed me that Jackson Hewitt had been paid last year. I had asked, "How?" That's when I was informed that a state return was at their office in Buffalo, NY since last year! Also, the person who prepared it didn't file the right innocent Spouse Form and therefore, the government took my 2009 Federal Tax return. To sum it up, I lost my apartment, and I am a single mother now living not the best of situation. They said that I will receive a check in 90 days. The tax preparer lied and said she overnighted it to Santa Barbara Bank in California. I called and they only got it on April 5th.
My wife and I went to Jackson Hewett to have our taxes done. Now, not being skilled in this area, we trust and paid a professional to do our taxes. In 2009, we received a refund of $8,000.00. Now, last week, we received a letter from the IRS saying we owe $11,400.00 dollars. I spoke with Eric in the main office here in Texas and come to find out because we purchased our house that same year and borrowed on a hardship from my wife's 401k, we were supposed to file a 1099. Now, that same year we received $8000.00 credit from the government. We had to take all that paperwork with us to file our taxes. I do believe as a business offering a service in taxes, we should have been informed of the fact that we needed a 1099r. Instead our taxes were done anyway and we were never alerted to the fact that we need this 1099r document. In speaking with Eric he in turn spoke to me as if I was a criminal! He says he wasn't there so he don't know what we said to her to get her to file our taxes without that 1099r. Now as we are depending on Jackson Hewett to do and get our taxes right and the profoundly advertise a guarantee or your money back. I really need a lawyer.
I called Jackson Hewitt and explained that I had W2"s, self employment, school, and an injured spouse that I wanted to file. Arriving at the office, Carol told me that I needed to do an Assisted Return and that I would receive my refund in 8 to 15 days. That was Feb 15 and it is now Mar 9. When I called today I was informed that it would probably be at least another month. I feel cheated that they lied to me and will never use them again. I will also urge anyone that I know to steer clear of Jackson Hewitt.
On January 14, we went to JH to get our taxes done. We asked the preparer in the beginning, "What do you charge to do taxes?" He said, "$80." Then, we got started. He got to the part with the loan offers. We asked for the prices of each along with time frames. We chose the RAL which he said would cost us $150. We repeated to him, "$150 RAL + $80 for taxes total?" He replied yes. He presented us with documents to sign, highlighting the spots for signature. We signed. A stack of stapled forms which included a cover sheet saying, "Thank you, you chose RAL. The following forms and schedules are part of you federal return 1040, tax benefits comparison, EIC, 8812, w-2; consent to use of tax return information (English and Spanish);consent to disclosure of tax return information (English and Spanish); Jackson Hewitt privacy policy (English and Spanish); suggestions for next years taxes and a federal and state return recap." He placed these in a folder and said to us, "Your refund amount for the federal is $2,950 and for the state is $477." He handed it as we prepared to pull out a form of payment confirming, once again, "$230, correct?" He said, "Yes, but you don't have to pay now. It will be deducted from your refund." He said that he would call when our loan check got there. We shook hands and walked out of there under the impression that we were paying $230 total to file our 2011 income tax return. We picked up both checks and we were never given actual copies of our return. On or about February 4, I received a letter from Republic Bank with an itemized breakdown of what we paid and got paid. On there it said that our refund amount was $3,513 and there was a charge of $451 tax prep fee. I immediately called JH and he said to bring in the papers. If there's a mistake, we would be issued a refund. I took the papers in and asked for a receipt and sure enough, the fee for tax services was $451. I asked him why we didn't get a receipt the same day we filed. He said that they don't give unless we ask. Then, I proceeded to ask, "why," after asking 3 different times, "did you not tell us that we would be paying more?" He said that the price doesn't come out on the screen even though he's been working there for at least a couple of years and knew very well that if we were using more forms, the price would be more than the standard $80. Still, he acted as though the bank was in error and offered to call them up and get back to me. I said that there is no error with the bank, the error is with them, assuring us that we were paying $80 and charging us $451. He then said, "Well, yours did require more forms." And once again, I said, "Then, why didn't you tell us? And why did we not get a receipt?" So I asked to see an itemized receipt because it just shows one lump fee. If I paid for more forms, there is a tax place that charges like $10-$30 per form. I then asked him if they conceal this information from all their customers and is it going to be necessary for me to stand outside the door and remind all their clients to ask for a receipt. He said, "Go ahead." So, I was like, "Okay. Let's be adult. Can you just show me what I paid for?" He then typed up a letter to corporate offices but I don't even think that he sent it anywhere. But I still said that the problem is not with corporate either. It is with them not telling us the truth about the price. I said, "Okay, let's see what corporate tells me. Maybe I can get an answer about being lied to from them." After a week, I still didn't hear from them so I called to speak with a manager. He was real busy so Herbert said that he would call me back on Monday. I went in five minutes later and there was one customer who was almost done. I felt lied to once again. I spoke to the manager and told him that I was quoted a price and left this office thinking that I would be paying that price. I then showed him the papers showing what I actually paid. And he asked me who helped me and that he would run it by his manager to get some kind of refund. I left and an hour later, my husband gets a call. It's Herbert saying that there will be no refunding because we paid everything as laid out in the receipt. My husband just said okay. I don't think that they should be able to get away with this because I know a tax place that charges $150. I could have gone there but I went JH because Herbert assured us that we were paying only $80.
I had my w-2z from my job and my unemployment for 2009. The lady that prepared my taxes last year, intentionally did not file my unemployment. Now, I'm getting a bill from the IRS saying that I owe $900. The manager at Jackson Hewitt says that they will pay the interest, but I still get stuck paying over $860. The manager also told me that it would be best to file jointly with my wife and to file an "injured spouse" so the IRS does not take her part of the taxes. He said they have the form that I needed to file that claim, and we'll do that when I come back in to file my taxes. This isn't right. I should not have to pay for something that some one else did.
I had a family emergency which forced me to apply for a RAL with the company. I went in with my returns already prepared with all supporting documentation to have them transmitted. I requested a next day refund of $1,500, the JH maximum, with the additional proceeds to be direct deposited. The preparer inadvertently checked the 8-15 day box and when I called on the next day, they looked for a check for me and discovered what had happened. I spoke with Pete, the local manager, and he told me that I should contact them again on the 8th day. Well, it has been 13 days, 3 calls to the corporate office, 4 to the local office, 6 promises, and no return calls later. I now have a Republic Bank estimation of the 25th. The IRS website is predicting 8 days later than the bank. I missed the funeral and ended up with a $384 deduction from my return to receive it early. This didn't happen and Jackson *** was the only winner. I found out that they should have only charged me a transmittal fee because my taxes were already done. I should have used TurboTax like I always do and waited the 8-15 days and saved $262 (the difference). I'm getting slower service than I would have gotten if I had waited. That is the worst!!! When I called to inquire, Lyndon *** was most rude, said he knew nothing and that I should call back the next day and talk to someone else and hung up the phone. First, I suffer from a JH employee's error then I have to deal with less than professional people. Maybe, the company should properly train or screen their seasonal help! Better yet, we should stop using them!
My husband and I both filed our taxes, separately with Jackson Hewitt. We were not told that by doing so we would not qualify for child or earned income credits. I received a return of more than $5000.00. When I filed my taxes, I told the preparer that I was married. He incorrectly filed me as head of household. My husbands taxes were all messed up. They got his social security number and address wrong. When he did not get his refund, we checked into the problem. We figured out that both our returns were done incorrectly. Had we not looked into this ourselves, we would have not been informed otherwise. We spent 10 hours at the Jackson Hewitt office over the course of 2 days trying to fix our problem. They amended my return to married filing jointly and combined my husband and my returns together as one. Since the company promises accuracy, I requested a refund since our returns were not filed correctly. I paid just short of $400.00 for my return and did not get the accuracy I was guaranteed. My husband paid $175.00 for his return, which was never filed because he ended up filing with me. After speaking with the manager, she admitted it was a mistake and promised us we would get our money refunded. Once we signed the amendment, we asked how we would get our money refunded. The manager then changed her story after getting our signatures and said we wouldn't get a refund and stated that we got what we paid for. I was also not disclosed the amount I would be charged for my taxes. I did not discover this until getting the paperwork after my signature was obtained electronically. They advertise a $38.00 refund and accuracy guaranty. These things are false. I feel we are entitled to a full refund of the cost of filing both of these returns for many reasons:1. We were verbally promised a refund. 2. Their mistakes cost us to have to repay an estimated $3000.00. 3. They wasted 10 hours of our time. 4. One of the returns we paid for was never filed. 5. We were misinformed by their so called professionals. 6. They made several errors on our taxes, not just one. 7. I don't feel I should have to pay for something that was done incorrectly. 8. They did not deliver what they promised us. 9. After running my husband's check through, they told us they voided it and needed a second check. Had we given them a second check, they would have charged us twice. 10. The mistakes they caused us have not only caused us time but a lot of stress. 11. We live an hour away from their office, so their mistake cost us a lot of drive-time and gas money among many other costs.12. Now, we have to come up with a large sum of money to pay back the IRS because of a mistake that the company made. Consumer's Desired Resolution: At the very least I expect a full refund of what we paid Jackson Hewitt to file our taxes. I also want a guarantee that all the mistakes they made on our taxes will be corrected. The manager told us because of their mistake that not only would we get a full refund but she would make sure that we had to pay little to nothing out of pocket. I would like them to make good on that promise and pay what we owe because of their mistake.
I went to get my taxes filed on February 2nd, being a new customer I realized it was going to take a little time. The preparer started putting the information in and half way through informed me that I was filing a long form they couldn't e-file my taxes due to a government screw up until after the 14th of February. That meant I would have to come back in a week to finish and sign my paperwork. My taxes were not complicated 1 to 2 weeks and some mortgage interest and property taxes. They did complete my state and local taxes that took all of about 5 minutes. A week later I went back to finish up my federal, an hour later I was finished, why an hour because my preparer was helping other preparers with their clients. My stuff should have taken no more than 10 minutes to complete. I was asked how I was going to pay and I replied cash, little did I know that my bill was going to be $189.00. In the 30 years of filing taxes I have never been charged that much. I could have understood the price if they did something but it wasn’t complicated and in doing some checking on tax deductions which they wouldn’t allow me any and something’s they never mentioned like medical expenses My work shoes and charity. My taxes are supposed to go through on the 14th we'll see.
I went to file taxes and the preparer told everybody my personal business even people from out of state. I feel that it was a very unprofessional thing to do. I'll never go to another Jackson Hewitt again.
I started a new job in February 2010. It had been a very rough year for me, so of course, I would be looking forward to receiving my income taxes all year long. In April 2010, I lost my daughter's father to sudden suicide. Then I found out I was pregnant in July 2010 with my 2nd child. In October 2010, I wrecked my car during the first rain, getting on the freeway and going home from work one night. Then in December 2010, I got let go from my job which was 2 days before Christmas. Yes, these are horrible events, but I was getting through them standing tall, because I just knew I had my income taxes to fall back on. After weeks of borrowing a car to take my daughter to school and my husband to work and paying a ride to drop both of them back off, I finally received my W2. I went to the Jackson Hewitt closest to my house. When I arrived, I'm greeted by a somewhat friendly staff. A man named David came up to me and introduced himself, shook my hand, and prompted me to follow him back to his desk. I complied. As we are sitting there, I overheard the supervisor introducing herself to another customer. Then I saw her grab her purse, keys, and cell phone and headed out the door. As David was sitting there inputting my info into the computer, I noticed he kept hitting bumps in the road. Each time he would hit a bump, he would look around for the supervisor Guadelupe who was nowhere to be found after she stepped out. I was starting to realize that David was inexperienced. After he was finished, he informed me I would be receiving $4700 federal and $37 state. I was fine with that. I wanted my funds directly deposited into my account. Another bump in the road, again he looked around for Guadelupe, but she was nowhere to be found. I had to show him how to set up the direct deposit on his screen. He nervously chuckled and informed me that he had never set up a direct deposit before, which made me further believe he really did not know the ropes yet. So I gave him the benefit of the doubt. (Wrong move!) I opted for option 2 to receive the funds in 8-15 days. After day 10 of nothing, I call the location to see what was going on. When the guy answered the phone, I did not even finish telling him what I needed before I was put on hold. Someone else picked up minutes later to tell me my check was not there. Um?... So I finally finished stating what I needed after all that confusion, only for him to give me some rehearsed line they probably give all their customers to keep them off their back. So a day or two more passed. I got a letter in the mail which said that the state was taking my taxes. So I called Jackson Hewitt immediately and asked to directly speak to the supervisor. Guadelupe got on the phone and assisted me. I told her what was going on, and she checked the status of my federal only to discover that all $4700 was sent out to a collection agency for an old student loan. I had previously set up payment arrangements with this agency, and they told me they would not touch my taxes. I completely understand that my situation with this loan has nothing to do with Jackson Hewitt. But in my opinion, the company should not let inexperienced people handle these types of affairs. I paid them hundreds of dollars for rushed service by an inexperienced employee. This was my first time filing with this company. All the other tax service company automatically checked to see if you owed and did the job their company is paid hundreds of dollars to do.
I filed my taxes on 20 Jan 11 at 12:15 AM and paid the extra fee because I was assured by the tax prep that I would receive my refund within 24 hours as advertised. I received $1,500 on 23 Jan 11 after paying fees worth $427. I was told later that an additional fee of $61 will be deducted too. I spoke with Samon **, who was rude about the entire situation, and after being misinformed, swept matters under the carpet. My complaint is that I have been misled and misinformed. Jackson Hewitt's staff doesn't want to acknowledge their error. For the past six years, the entire refund was issued within 24 hours. If matter has changed, Jackson Hewitt staff should have made it plainly. I would have taken other options instead of paying $482 for a service not rendered.
Jackson Hewitt claimed that they made a mistake on my tax return for 2007, by adding Yolanda's share of the 74.25400 that should have been divided into two after I told Ray ** that Yolanda and I were not together anymore. Ray told me that in such a case, they could not do one of our taxes, but instead he referred me to one of his staff Patricia ** who has not been seen, since I raised the issue concerning this matter. How can Ray tell us that it was a mistake, when in fact, he didn't do my tax for that year? The record shows that Yolanda's annual income was more than mine, and her tax was done on the 4th of April 2008. They did my tax on the 15th of April, eleven days after her tax was done. Why did he exempt her from the 37,12700, eleven days before my tax was done? Her returns netted over twelve thousand dollars, when I was told that I owe about eleven thousand dollars. In my opinion, it was done intentionally.
Not a complaint! RAL, this is a loan from the financing bank partnered with Jackson Hewitt. It is not a refund. (RAL, the L is for Loan) The loan is repaid to the bank via the IRS. It can take up to two weeks for the IRS to deposit the funds to the bank. People who are declined are not charge the RAL interest fees. The fees are added back. So complaining about Jackson Hewitt not giving you 'your refund' is insane. If you elect to have the fee deducted from your expected refund, you are actually receiving a loan. The bank will not release a check until the IRS has deposited your refund. If you owe the IRS back child support, past-due student loans, etc., the IRS will forward the difference if any to the bank. The bank will deduct Jackson Hewitt fees and bank fees from the deposited refund. The remaining amount if any, will be the amount the taxpayer received. The fees are deducted from the state or federal, whichever the bank receives first. If you want to avoid any additional fees, pay cash/check and file EFT and wait the 2 to 3 weeks for the IRS and state to mail or direct deposit. Jackson Hewitt provides excellent services. Taxpayers need to read what they are signing and understand if Jackson Hewitt deducts the fees for preparing the returns. It is a loan not a refund. If you don't feel comfortable with your preparer asked for another preparer.
I did my taxes with Jackson Hewitt in 2008. I took out a loan from my 401k and got my 1099 form to fill out so I wouldn't get penalized. They told me it wasn't necessary to fill the form and I told them that it was. And they didn't put the information on the tax form on top of the charged that I got. I paid for an insurance if I had any problems. What happened was I received a letter now two years later and now they can't solve anything and I have to pay $800 to the IRS, which I don't have money to pay because I'm on disability.
This lady prepared our income tax returns and really messed them up twice! It has cost us upwards of $4000. She told me I didn’t need the gold seal for an extra $30. Boy, was she wrong. And now they won’t back their work. I’m feeling as if I’ve been ripped off by the government. It cost me almost $4000 in back taxes that Jackson Hewitt didn’t put in as income.
I have had Jackson Hewitt do my taxes for me for the last 7 years. I have been a loyal customer and have directed family to them for business. In September 2010, I received a letter from the IRS stating there was a problem with my 2008 return. It seemed that a W2 had been left out. I proceeded to get my 2008 return papers that Jackson Hewitt had prepared for me and went over them. There was the W2 form that the IRS said was never filed. I contacted Jackson Hewitt and told them of the problem. They said they would look into it. After looking into this matter, they determined the lady that had prepared the tax return had the W2, she just hadn't added it to the return. Now, I have always bought the Gold Guarantee and upon looking into the file, she had also forgot to check that. After much arguing with the Appomattox office, I was directed to the branch owner. He proceeded to inform me that although they made the mistake and admitted it, they would only pay the $22.00 in interest. They refused to make good on their mistake and also will not refund my money I paid them to do the tax return in the beginning. If I had wanted to take a chance at them being wrong, I could have done them myself for free. Now, I am out what I paid them to have them done right not wrong and the $491.00 mistake they made that I had to pay the IRS. Never again will I or anyone in my family use them again. When they admittedly made a mistake and you have to still pay, who is being held responsible? This is poor business practice at best.
I have read much of the more than 50 pages of complaints against Jackson-Hewitt. I have some 20 years experience equally split between H&R Block and Jackson-Hewitt. Most of the complaints I have read relate to the bank products (RAL, AR (assisted refund) Money Now Loan, iPower Card, etc. In virtually every case, people are complaining that they are paying for service they aren't getting. In almost every case, it isn't true. The tax preparation applies regardless of a bank product and it isn't modified if a bank product is denied. People who do not receive the RAL are not charged the bank fee, but are usually charged a "service fee" (check writing and office administration) which is generally a flat rate in the range of $40, plus or minus $5 or $10. There is liability that attaches to tax preparation and preparers should be compensated for their services. So many complainers are trying to blame everything on the tax preparation despite the fact that the huge number of complaints provide no basis at all in demonstrating the tax preparer (office) is actually at fault. Many times, I have seen people come back with an IRS notice in their hands complaining that the tax preparer had made the mistake. In some cases, it will be true. All tax preparers are not equal in experience or ability. But it is too easy and convenient to blame a tax preparer for a mistake when it is because a W-2 or a 1099 or income on a Schedule C is understated by taxpayer. As I read these complaints, there is a glaring consistency: never accepting blame for anything on the part of the taxpayer. It simply doesn't work that way and I'm sure most people complaining know it. Nevertheless, people seek to blame tax preparers for everything that besets them: mortgage payments behind 3 months or more, foreclosures, electric cut off, and the list is endless. Most people hear only what they "want" to hear. Example: "The RAL is one or two days. If it isn't approved, it will 'revert to an AR' and you should have it in about two weeks (8-15 days)." Tax preparation fees are not affected by RAL's or any other bank product. The tax office has no control over bank products. Most of which the bank products would go away because they create most of the problems for us. The complexity of a tax return (number of forms, W-2's, 1099's, DIV, INT, OID, etc.) determines what the fee is. Most preparers have a discretionary amount they can discount on any particular tax return, but the fees are fixed by the company or the franchise operating the tax offices, usually around 5 to 10 percent. Look at the tax office itself: computers, shredders, faxes, telephones, cabinets, desks, etc., all equipment that is used during the first 3 months but has to be kept as if used 12 months. There is always an overhead. Every year, the tax laws become more and more complex with new credits and changes to the tax laws, credits the average taxpayers doesn't even know exists. Most offices get it right, but if you do taxes, you will make mistakes from time to time. We all do, each and every one of us, and if it is our mistake, we'll own up to it, but don't try and blame us for every bad thing that happens to you from the firstborn on down. I have seen my share of tax payers who believe that "we" prepared their return wrong because they don't get the bank product or refund they believe they're entitled to. Often, refunds will be reduced for non-payment of any type of government loan, delinquent child support, or any other such debts to such agencies. I have seen people state unequivocally they have no such debt or charges against them and knew they weren't being honest when they said it. In the days of computers and social security numbers (or TINs) it cannot be hidden; the agencies will catch up with a tax payer and a lien against a tax refund is the way they do it. Tax preparers are not responsible for these problems and it is grossly unfair to attribute matters that are beyond their control to them. Tax preparers aren't responsible if they haven't been given all the information needed (held out by the taxpayer at times). Oh, and if a tax office or a tax preparer has a taxpayer's "check" coming to them, it's a crime and is punishable in a court of law.
We had our 2008 taxes prepared who we thought was a qualified tax preparer, with Jackson Hewitt. He went through all the papers we provided, and noticed a RR Retired statement in which he was not familiar with. He made a phone call then finalized our taxes. We decided to pay extra for a Gold Guarantee in the event the taxes were prepared incorrectly in which they will guarantee up to $5000.00, which I am glad we did. It was late and at the last minute, but after all said and done, we received a refund for 2008 which would come in a few weeks. We paid a hefty amount to have the taxes prepared thinking he was a qualified and knew what he was doing. You know all you see is them clicking on the keyboard of the computer and we are just sitting and listening to him talk. When 2009 came around to do our taxes, we were told by another company that 2008 were done incorrectly. We were told that all the income from the RR retirement was not included anywhere on the tax forms anywhere. That is why we got the great refund. Of course, the only thing we heard during the whole 2008 process was refund, so we were happy to just get out of there and go home. Great, I wasn't working at the time and collecting unemployment and we could use the money so we put all our papers away and waited for the refund. We were told to go back and contact Jackson Hewitt and explained everything to them everything was done incorrectly. They found their copies of the taxes and confirmed that the income was not reported on the forms. They wanted to know if we took the paperwork in with all the other papers, which that would have been ludicrous not to, but we confirmed that we did bring all papers to the preparer and he did see the RR retirement statement. Well, since 2008 was wrong, it of course made 2009 wrong as well. It seems that no one knows exactly how to prepare taxes with RR retirement. Anyway, since we had the guarantee, we figured we were at least covered for the 5k and I guess we would have to make arrangements for fixing the next years taxes. Long story short, we owe lots of money for 2008 and also 2009 and when we had someone go over everything. They ended up amending them all, 2007, 2008 and 2009. So, Jackson Hewitt got us fixed up to submit the Gold Guarantee 5k money, which is all they will pay to help us, and we owe what is remaining which is a lot more than that. We faxed all the papers in April to the appropriate people to start the works of getting the money to pay down some of the owed tax money. Well, we are now in September and still no one has called us back, or emailed us except one time to fax more papers to the same company. I have tried calling everyone from the original tax preparer who tried to straighten things out, to her boss several times, to another tax preparer who tried desperately to help us, but we haven't heard from her in a while to now just the customer service number. They referred us to the Gold Guarantee Help line in which the phone just rings and rings. I called at the beginning May and in June and now August to the actual tax preparers, the boss of the preparers and now the help customer phone number and they referred me to another number which now they say the account was on hold and they couldn't tell us why because they didn't know. They gave us another number back east and that number just rings and rings. I called back the customer service no. and now they said the paperwork is ready for review? They could not tell me what that means review and how long or when will someone call us with an update. No one has answers no one knows anything. I guess. Four (4) months from now, we are going to have to find another tax preparer that knows what they are doing so we can get this straighten out, but in the meantime, we are just stuck, with a Gold Guarantee that is not producing anything and no one can give us any information. I am afraid they are waiting for a certain time frame and then they will say the Gold Guarantee has expired and we cannot use it any longer. We need advise and help real bad.
I wanted to get into the franchise business and was misguided by Jackson Hewitt Tax Service staff. I signed up for three locations. I was promised that JH would be standing behind with their marketing support. When I called the marketing division, I was told they do not have the money! I did not want to be a failure; so I liquidated all my savings and retirement funds which were used towards marketing and promotion. During the tax season, I found that there was no support from the head office. You are on your own and Jackson Hewitt is interested only in the royalty collection. They do not have any ethics. In order not to lose my name in the community as a tax specialist, I spent hours and hours working on individual tax returns. The proprietary tax software of Jackson Hewitt stinks. You are better off by buying Turbo Tax. To make my story short, I do not want to be part of the unethical behavior of Jackson Hewitt and their cheating pattern of the public; I decided to close down my Jackson Hewitt shops. This cost me all my life savings of more than $222,000. Now I am a poor man, but rich in heart. I’m happy that I haven't cheated but helped people. I lost $222,000 because of Jackson Hewitt's lying and cheating and I'm sure there are lots of others who are victims. I lost $222,000 for taking three franchises of Jackson Hewitt. Upon finding out that they are not trustworthy on the second year of operation, I decided to close them down, and lost all money. Jackson Hewitt does not even want to repay the royalty fee.
I went to a Jackson Hewitt store in Kingman AZ to have my 2008 taxes done. Dianne told us what we were getting back and sent off the taxes. About two weeks later we heard about this home buyers credit, but did not know if we qualify, so we called our tax lady. Dianne told us that we qualified and to come down to do the amendment. We got the $7500.00 dollars and used it to move. About two months ago we received a letter from the IRS asking for information about the home that we bought. With no worries we sent proof we bought the home, driver’s license and a utility bill. About a week ago we got another letter from the IRS saying that we owe them $7928.48, because we did not qualify for that credit. We had owned a home in Kingman, and Dianne new that we did because she claimed our home interest on the taxes she had originally filed. I instantly called the Jackson Hewitt franchise were I had my taxes done, and Colleen answered the phone and told me that Dianne did not work there during the off season. I told her my complaint and she told me that her franchise was only responsible for the penalties and interest that there was nothing else she could do. I had to set up payment plans with the IRS which will take years to pay back, not to mention I have now been red flagged and can be audited every year for the next ten years. I had to trade in my truck for a lot less of a vehicle to be able to make the payments to the IRS.
I was told by my incompetent tax preparer that I could claim head of household and my boyfriend's son as he lived with me for over 6 months. I received a letter from the IRS stating that I couldn't claim these allowances and thus owe $4,381.00. I had the gold guarantee from Jackson Hewitt (the preparer never even asked if I wanted it) and filed a claim with them. Needless to say, my claim #** was denied. I now owe the IRS $4,381 that I do not have. These crooks have to be stopped as they hire incompetent workers who obviously do not know the tax laws.
Let me explain on this Jackson Hewitt complaint trail. I started working for them in 1998; I worked from 1998 to 2006 in Kansas City KS for the Customers First! Franchisee. Then in 2007, I went to work for Himalaya Financial in Leavenworth. I can tell you most Jackson Hewitts are hiring inexperienced people with a three day fast track course; some do take the tax class. I had done taxes for 30 years prior and was with Block. I was office Manager in KCKS for one year but found it was too difficult to do that and work my full time job. So I gave up the position and worked as a preparer. Jackson Hewitt is in it for the money. They charge $300-$400 for a basic return. I got my return free. I don't recommend an RAL unless you are in dire straits. I also don't recommend the I Power Card as it is full of fees. If you have a bank account do it online at the IRS website. I was in the business just to make a commission. So the more I sold, the more I got. I got out after business declined so much I went from a $1300 bonus to $150. I can do from home and charge people $50 cash and make more. There are those of us knowledgeable preparers out there that can help you and charge less. When you go to a large corporation like Block or JH or Liberty you will pay more. Incidentally, Liberty is owned by the founder of Jackson Hewitt so you will get similar rates there.
I gave a copy of my State ID, W2 form and a signed self employment form to a client of mine, who in turn submitted these items to Norma **, an agent of Jackson Hewitt to process my tax forms. I was never contacted nor visited by my client Maria nor the agent Norma ** to review or sign papers. A month or so later, I received copies of what was filed to the IRS and State Treasurer. To my surprise, the forms where filed incorrectly with information regarding "dependents". I don't know how this information got added to my return but it was inaccurate. Additionally, my business expenses were never included in this tax form. I received a letter from the IRS requesting evidence of the proposed dependents (that "I" never claimed but were added to my return somehow). Of course, I could not provide any because I never gave that information to the tax preparer. This error has cause me a penalty of not being able to claim any "Earned Income Credit" for the next two years from my Federal Income tax and a debt to the State Treasurer in the amount of $1,567.20 plus all accruing interest. Jackson Hewitt Tax Services performed their service inadequately and fraudulently.
It been four days since I filled out my online complaint form with Jackson Hewitt. Still no phone call. Still no e-mail reply. Wow! That is the worst customer service I've seen in a long time. It's one thing when you get bad service at a restaurant, but with your taxes?!
They prepared my taxes, took my money and told me to call back if I had problems. I had problems. Now their local office is closed and the home office has denied every request I've made of them to help me. They simply say they'll investigate who I should talk to locally. Then they never call back. I've submitted at least 3 of their customer feedback forms on their website and haven't gotten even a courtesy canned e-mail saying they have received the forms.
Jackson Hewitt did my taxes. I had a problem, and now they won't return calls. Their office is shut down, and the home office keeps telling me they'll "investigate" and "escalate" their effort to get a person to talk to me but to no avail. Never, ever, ever again will I have them do my taxes. Tax payers, beware!
We have been going to Jackson Hewitt for two yrs. I told them that I have helped take care of my fiance's child before she was even born. I was there the day she was born and I help financially and emotionally raise her. I made it clear to them that she's not biologically mine but in my heart she is. We asked them if it was legal for me to claim her. They told me yes since I help to raise her financially and I pay almost all the cost. Today, I get a letter from the IRS stating they are auditing me since I'm not suppose to claim her, since she's not legally mine, and were not legal married, and that we have nothing through the courts. I feel that Jackson Hewitt should be responsible for the cost since we asked them over and over again if it was legal for me to claim her and they said yes.
On March 1, 2010, my wife and I went to Jackson Hewett to get our taxes done. Our tax preparer, named Elana, prepared our taxes. We had a $4,400.00 refund coming because I am on a disability fixed income. She told us that the check will come there to the office and that they would take out their fee of $300.00 and change. They mailed our returns, and she said it will be a few weeks. We said okay. Well, here it is, July. We contacted the Manning office, and a woman answered the phone. This was on June 16, and she took my information and said let me check. She was very rude. She put me on hold for 5 minutes or so and then she picked up the phone and hung up, so I called again. This time, I got a Tony, a district manager. I told him what happened. He said, "We don't hang up on people." I did not want a conflict, so I told him what I was trying to do. He then said that the manning office was closed for the season and all the files went to the Sumter office. He put me on hold for a bit and then he said our check was at the Sumter office. He told me the hours and said to ask for Robert. On the next day, June17, we drove 40 minutes to Sumter. We met Robert and told him why we were there. He knew nothing about it and he said the files from Manning weren't there and he could not print a check, so he called Mr. T, and told him what was going on. When he got off the phone, he said that he will get an authorization from Florence, SC to print a check, so we went home empty handed, and wasted gas. On the next day, Jjune18, Robert called and said he was working on it. Later that day, I was outside when a person named Heather called, and left a message that the check was mailed. I went to call her back, and a person named Laura answered. She was nasty and said, "Heather's not here," and hung up! So, I called Robert. He said the check was cut at 10 am on Friday, June18 and mailed that day from Republic Bank and that I should have it by Tuesday, June 22. On Tuesday, I checked my mail, and there was no check. So, I called Robert again, and he said, "Let me check it out." I called him later that day, and he told me that it was mailed from Kentucky and I should have it. I told him, "Look, I really need this money. I'm hurting." She said, "Yeah, I know how it is!" On Thursday, June 24, no check came, so I called Mr. T. and explained what was going on. He said that he was in Atlanta, GA for a tax seminar, but he would look into it, a few minutes. Later, Robert called and said that no check was mailed, that Republic Bank does not mail checks, that they have ua print checks, and that he was going to chew out a person named Lisa for this mess up! The next day, June 25, Robert called me at approximately 2:30pm and asked me to come into the Sumter office, and he said that he had to make a copy of my ID and he will print me a check, so I called my job (part time at auto zone), and told them that I was going to be a little late. I drove 40 minutes to Sumter. I went in and Robert took my driver's license, made a copy, and said, "Hopefully on Monday!" I was livid. I told him, "You said I would have a check!" He just walked away from me, I said to him calmly that I am sick of these lies and I want my money. This is nonsense and it is theft and fraud! I had to get to work, and on my way to work, my vehicle broke down. I was really late, and I got a bad point on my record! On Monday, June 28, I called, and there was no answer! On Tuesday, June 29, I called Robert. He said that the bank sent our check to the wrong address, and they had to do a stop payment, and a person named Marian was going to authorize it. He will cut the check and he will call me later that day! i did not hear from him! On Wednesday, June 30, I got nothing! On Thursday, July 1, I called Robert, and he said that he was still waiting on this person. I said, "Look, it does not take 3-4 days to do a stop payment and issue a check!" I then said calmly, "Enough! This has been going on for two weeks now! The IRS has mailed the check on April 16 and Jackson Hewett got it on April 22. Where is my money?" He then said, "I don't know what to tell you!" I then informed Robert that if I don't have it by close of business today, I was going seek legal help. He said, "Go ahead!" This is an outrage! Jackson Hewett are crooks and should go to jail! They say nothing but lies! Help!
I needed to amend a tax return from a previous year because I didn't understand that I needed to fill out the 1099-DIV in order to claim my capital gains losses. I needed to respond to an IRS amendment to said previous tax year that claimed I owed money on what were overall losses on the fiscal year. Since I was busy, I wanted to just throw the task at a professional and not try to do it myself for the first time. I contacted Theresa and explained my situation. I went down to her office with a copy of all the paperwork necessary for her to do the job. The first thing that made me suspicious was her request that the fee be paid in cash (and a rather high fee of $150). Again, I didn't want to deal with this and wanted a professional to handle it. Plus, I figured the refund from my overpaid taxes would probably pay for the service. The next day, I decided to call corporate and ask them if it was normal for one of their franchisees to conduct business on a cash only basis—that was a waste of time. I got some ESL student who was trying to communicate with me off a script and did not respond directly to my questions. I ended up hanging up on her. OK, so the following day I got a call from Theresa telling me that my taxes are done and ready. "Oh, and by the way, it's going to cost $200 now," she tells me. After inquiring why, I was told that a “supervisor" came in afterward and corrected the fee to the higher amount because $150 was only for people who electronically filed through Jackson Hewitt and it's $200 for people whose returns need to be entered in by hand and not retrieved "out of the system." After invoking the fact that we had a verbal agreement, I told her that she can't simply change the price after the fact without consulting me and I wouldn't pay it. She immediately relented without a fight and said she'd explain to her "supervisor" (her business card says "Store Manager") the situation and that $150 in cash would be fine. So I questioned her about the cash thing. She could give me no reasonable explanation as to why her business cannot conduct an electronic payment. She then proceeded to tell me that I actually didn't lose money from stock trading that previous tax year and that I had, in fact, made $500 and that I would owe $75 to the IRS. Right there, I knew that she was full of garbage and inquired as to how I could have possibly made money that year, which was a bad year for my fledgling stock trading activities. I initially said that I was coming down to her office, but I decided not to waste any more time and got out my trading records for that year. After spending a tedious hour or two adding up the numerous "day trade" style moves, I found out what I knew all along. I lost approximately $1200 on trading after you subtracted the roughly $500 in gains on the year. Yes, I made $500 all right, but it was actually about $463 when you subtracted the trading fees. So, I called Theresa back and told her that I was nulling our verbal agreement due to bad faith and incompetence. Personally, I don't think this woman was incompetent as much as she was trying to see how much money she could shake out of me. The first time I was at the office, she was dealing with a gentleman that spoke broken English and appeared to be a recent immigrant. I have to wonder what kind of little scams this woman has pulled in the past and will pull in the future. I have no idea why this woman actually thought I was this stupid. I thought it was clear that I was using her for convenience (because I actually thought I was going to be busier than I actually became) and not because I'm dumb as a post. It would have been interesting to run a sting operation on her and see exactly what she was going to try and pull with my tax return. Was she going to actually submit my taxes as erroneously making $500 in stock trading for that year? I personally wonder if there was going to be a bait and switch with me handing over $200 in cash for her "services" and an additional $75 for "money I owe the IRS" with said money simply ended up in her pocket –under the table, too. I should have known when she never filled out an invoice or had me sign anything and asked for cash. She's a total huckster and I can only imagine what she's done to people in the past. I'm sure she probably doesn't screw everyone but picks her targets. Fortunately, I only wasted my time and not any money. This incident motivated me to do the work myself. That's not what I wanted of course, but it just shows that you can't trust anyone.
When I filed my 2008 tax return the tax preparer told us that we qualified for a first time home buyer’s credit (even after looking at all of our mortgage paperwork). I received a letter from the IRS in 2010 stating that we didn’t qualify and had to pay it back with interest. $8000! We informed Jackson Hewitt of this to be told that if our gold guarantee that we paid for was approved they would only pay a maximum of $5000. The secondary tax preparer we spoke with found multiple problems with our 2008 return (missing signatures, wrong info, etc.). I didn’t think it was fair that because of their mistake, at best, I would still be out of pocket $3000 or more. We filed the appropriate information to try to get the $5000 to send to the IRS regardless. A few days later, the preparer said she needed more information. We went up there only to be told her printer was broken and we needed to make copies of the paperwork for her. Wasn't that her responsibility? After driving around to make copies, in the dead heat with an upset 2-year old, my wife finally made copies and brought them back. Upon giving them to the tax preparer we were told, "Oh I forgot to tell you, they have to be notarized.” The nerve of this lady. She then said right after I left she got my scanner/printer to work. Keep in mind she had our cell number and could have called us to let us know instead of having us run around for nothing. Finally everything was in order and she told us she had submitted it to the insurance and that we would have a reply in no later than 3 weeks. That was in April 2010. By the end of June 2010, I was wondering why we hadn't heard anything. I did some digging and obtained the phone number to the insurance company. I called them and found out that Jackson Hewitt never submitted all of the information. This really made me mad so I called Jackson Hewitt again, only to be told they would call me right back. Well, they never called me back. I don't know what to do. My debt with IRS is growing with interest and Jackson Hewitt doesn't care to take care of a problem that they caused in the first place. I owe IRS over $8000. Money that was needed to fix the roof on my house now has to be used to give to the IRS. I have wasted so much time trying to pursue collection in this matter. No one will help me. It’s unfair that this company is not being held responsible.
We have been trying to reach Mr. Richard ** for the past 3 days. I need a copy of 2009 1040 face sheet for my work. I requested he fax it. I never heard from him. The woman that answers this phone number claims he has gotten all of the messages, but no answer. When asked if she was the answering service, she said she was not allowed to say. What kind of nonsense is this? It’s totally irresponsible to their customers. This has also happened in the past with this particular location.
I went to JH in February 2010 to do my taxes this year, because my husband passed away and I wanted to make sure it was done right. I was told my taxes would take a while, because we just got a new house. So I didn't expect my refund for a while; I knew that part going into it. Now it's been 5 months, and still when I called the 800 number, it still says they are waiting for the IRS to accept it. So I went on the IRS site, and for the longest time, it gave me a date by which I should get my refund. Then when that day passed and still no money, I went back to JH and guess what? They were no longer there, so I had to find another JH store, and the man there treated me like a fool. He said he didn't have any way of knowing what was going on and that I needed to call the IRS myself and it wasn't their problem. So I did, and the IRS said that my tax returned was filled twice and is now being investigated. So thank you so much, JH, for making my life so much hard. I lost my home to a fire and my husband of 13 years, and now, I have no refund to help support my kids. I will never use them again.
Ok first of all, let me say that when you walk into a tax preparation service, you expect the preparer to know more about taxes than you. But after using Jackson Hewitt, that all changed. I walked into a local tax office of Jackson Hewitt on April 10th. I met a pleasant enough woman behind the desk. She made small talk as she completed my Federal tax return first. She told me I owed $586.00 and I told her there was a mistake somewhere in what she was doing. There was no way that was correct and I mentioned to her that she didn’t even ask me about my property taxes. Now, I am sitting on the other side of the desk telling a trained tax preparer how to do her job? I should’ve gone with my gut instinct and walked out, but I didn’t. She proceeded to do the return again and said I was getting a refund of $1,383.00. That sounded more reasonable and she started on the state return. She told me that I had to pay $40.00 to the state and after signing all the paperwork. I walked away thinking that my returns would be filed that day, which is what I paid for. Around the middle of May, I decided to check on my refund and went on the IRS website and entered all my information. A message came up that I would have to call the 800 number for the IRS during business hours, which I did. The IRS agent told me that the return had not been filed. They told me to take it up with Jackson Hewitt. Now, of course, the office that I had dealt with was a seasonal office so I called an office in Greenville RI. I left a message for someone to call me and of course no one returned my call. The next day I called several times and talked to a woman who told me that it looked like there had been an error and that they would file my returns that day. I had also asked for the manager's name and his name was Steven and she would tell him to call me and of course he never called. I was somewhat upset that no one returned my call and that I had no idea why the returns had not been filed. No one seemed to care at Jackson Hewitt. After making myself perfectly clear to the woman on the phone that I wanted those returns filed, I really didn’t expect what happened in the beginning of June. On June 8th of 2010, I again had not heard anything and went on the IRS website and went through the whole routine again, talking to a very nice IRS agent who looked into everything and said that he was confident the return still had not been filed. I admit at this point I was really angry. I went to work and found a customer service number for Jackson Hewitt. After repeating the spelling of my first and last names 5 or so times, he gave me a case/complaint number and said someone would be in contact with me in 5 days. On the third day, I received a call from Steven from the RI office (yes same guy that was supposed to call me back before). He told me that there was a problem with my state return and instead of owing $40.00 I owed an additional $1,000.00. I asked him why no one had contacted me in regards to this, he said he didn’t know. I asked him what gives him the right to hold my federal return with a $1,383.00 refund while all the accountants at Jackson Hewitt put their one pee sized brain together to figure out what they did on my state return. He didn’t have an answer and said it was a mistake. I understand that mistakes happen, but someone should have told me what was going on instead of having me looking and expecting a refund from the government for a return that was not even filed. Oh and they must have really did a number on my state return to go from a liability of $40.00 to $1,000.00. I can’t wait to get a copy of my return that they filed without me seeing it. Is this legal? Also, their data entry skills are just as bad; they entered my wrong city and state on both returns. Jackson Hewitt should spend a few more dollars on training their preparers and a ** of a lot more money on customer service. The best advertising is word of mouth and nothing but bad words will come out of mine in regards to this nightmare.
Ok first of all, let me say that when you walk into a tax preparation service, you expect the preparer to know more about taxes than you. But after using Jackson Hewitt, that all changed. I walked into a local tax office of Jackson Hewitt on April 10th. I met a pleasant enough woman behind the desk. She made small talk as she completed my Federal tax return first. She told me I owed $586.00 and I told her there was a mistake somewhere in what she was doing. There was no way that was correct and I mentioned to her that she didn’t even ask me about my property taxes. Now, I am sitting on the other side of the desk telling a trained tax preparer how to do her job? I should’ve gone with my gut instinct and walked out, but I didn’t. She proceeded to do the return again and said I was getting a refund of $1,383.00. That sounded more reasonable and she started on the state return. She told me that I had to pay $40.00 to the state and after signing all the paperwork. I walked away thinking that my returns would be filed that day, which is what I paid for. Around the middle of May, I decided to check on my refund and went on the IRS website and entered all my information.

After receiving a past due notice from the IRS for underpayment of $250 plus penalties and interest, I contacted JH who had prepared our taxes. They provided me with a hard copy of what they filed and it was $250 more than the letter we were given the day we filed. They blamed the IRS. We paid the money due the IRS and learned the Gold promise we purchased for an additional $30.00 in case they make a mistake is a scam. You can lose a business one customer at a time. They've lost this one.
I have tried to reach Steve on 4 different occasions, always leaving messages that were never returned. I left a file with him from 2008 for him to make a correction on my 2009 tax return, which he never did. He said he would look into it. He has never called or returned my file. I went to the office to retrieve my file, which is the original paperwork. Office closed. I have called as stated approx. 4 times and each time have spoken to a woman named Marilyn, who tells me all Richard does is call her for his messages. The last time I spoke to her I asked to her to tell him please mail back my file from Bank of America. The last time I saw it, he had put in on the cabinet behind his desk. I really could use some help in this matter since I can't get through to this guy and he won't contact me. This is a $500 error on his part which he says he doesn't know how to fix.
I am very upset that I had my 2009 tax returns done by this person who is not a CPA or Accountant. She was just "trained" by Jackson Hewitt. I paid $236 to have my tax returns prepared and she made an error on my Federal Return. After waiting 8 weeks for my refund, I received a letter from the IRS stating that a form 5405 was not attached to my tax return for my 1st time home buyer credit. Now I have to wait another 6 to 8 weeks for my refund to be mailed to me. I had my taxes done on Apr 1st. I took the letter to Jackson Hewitt in Mesa and the manager (Stephanie) faxed it to the IRS for me. She said it normally takes up to 12-16 weeks to receive a refund for the 1st time home buyer credit anyways. I understand that, but I should have received my Federal Income Tax refund portion by now and perhaps the 1st time home buyer credit later, but because of their mistake, I now have to wait another 6-8 weeks more for my refund. I am very upset and they did absolutely nothing to compensate me for their mistake. They obviously don't train their people well enough. I should have been refunded some of the $236 dollars for their error. I will never use Jackson Hewitt again. Filing income tax refunds is a very important necessity in our lives and to have someone incompetent to file them is totally unacceptable. I am single and recently unemployed right now and I desperately needed that refund to live on. They have totally put me in a very bad position right now.
My taxes for the year 2009 were prepared by Jackson Hewitt. When they were prepared, I purchased the Gold Guarantee with my package. This gold guarantee pack is for the purpose of having a Jackson Hewitt representative handle the audit for the person who purchases it. They speak directly to the IRS about taxes with the consent of the person getting audited. I in turn got audited. I called Jackson Hewitt Nampa, Idaho office and the general manager there (Kathy) advised me to take letter that I received from the IRS so that she could see what they were requesting from me. Upon arrival to the office, there was a note on the door stating that office was closed until further notice. I have called the corporate office numerous times and have been told that a representative from Jackson Hewitt would call me back within 5 business days and I have yet to receive a call from anyone. I was told that each and every time I called. I was not sure what I was to do at that point so I got online and went to a Jackson Hewitt website where questions can be asked and answered. So I asked my question only to find out there was a charge to get the answer. So again, I didn't get anywhere with their website either. I've had to turn to other alternatives for help and was not very happy with that at all. I paid for a service at Jackson Hewitt, I should have received it or at least answer my messages and return my calls. I did not get information requested to the IRS at that time since I was waiting for Jackson Hewitt's call for assistance and will be having to pay $1800.00 back to the IRS, instead of receiving a return. Like I was supposed to have gotten.
I paid for the Gold Guarantee coverage for $40. They did my 2007 taxes wrong and now I owe taxes of $2900 for 2007 and Gold Guarantee won't pay the claim. They have given me several stupid reasons and every time I get one resolved, they come up with another stupid reason. I owe $2,900 in taxes and interest and penalties that keep growing.
I was just randomly going through these consumer reports. I know I have no life. I did just want to make a quick statement about Jackson Hewitt. I have gotten my taxes done there for about the last 5 years or so. I had always gotten a RAL. This past year, I did go in to a center, and the lady who was working there stayed open late for me and also did advise me before we got too far into the process that they weren't doing the RAL this year due to the economy. I am very fortunate to have worked with such an honest lady, because taxes are expensive when you get them done at a center like this; and I feel horrible for everyone who was treated so badly. Just wanted to let you all know, there is at least one fantastic tax preparer.
I worked for Jackson Hewitt for two seasons, but this season started out bad from the beginning and I sensed that this would not go well right from the beginning. I was let go about one month or so before the season ended. They said they were cutting the hours at the Walmart stores, but that was clearly not the reason for my being let go. I am a strong, independent woman and I am not the kind of employee that *** up to the boss. I do my job well, if not better than some of the people I work with. I did more returns than anyone in my office, both last year and was on my way to doing the same this year but I was clearly marked by Jana ***. I had a bad fall and had to call in one Friday. I did, but my manager at the Walmart was out of town and after talking to her she wanted me to call Jana, the regional manager and not my immediate manager, so I felt that this was not my place to do that. I never had to call Jana before with the other manager we had, but this new manager could not handle the position. When I made clear about what was happening, shortly after I was let go. The thing that I am mad about is I called to get my bonus check and Jana lied and said that they were keeping my check because I didn't qualify for my bonus. When I asked her why, she replied I was stealing from the company, which is an outright lie. She said I was doing taxes outside and using Jackson Hewitt to do it. I did taxes at home as well as every other employee for Jackson Hewitt, but I never used Jackson Hewitt to do it. This is slander and I will not tolerate it from anyone. Please advise as to how I can get my bonus pay and stop Jackson Hewitt from their underhanded practices.
I filed a 2008 amendment. They gave us the wrong amount and the IRS corrected the problem. I contacted Jackson Hewitt of the mistake in hopes they would honor their guarantee for the mistake. It's been a month now and no one seems to be there when call. I leave messages with my number but they don't return the call
I took my taxes in on 4-15-10. The preparer took my info and entered into system. I had to return home for additional papers for unemployment benefits. Upon returning, the office was closed. Also, the following morning office was closed. I tried calling no answer. I went to their office located in Wal-Mart only to find their booth taken down. I inquired within the store. The clerk tried calling the phone was disconnected. I tried calling the good number several times no answer. I sent an e-mail to Jackson Hewitt explaining the situation. No response. Today is the 21st, still no response. I don't know if the preparer filed an extension or what. Please help.
Upon preparing my return, it was decided (through questioning from preparer) that I owed $508 to the IRS. I was informed that the service would cost me $175 from Jackson-Hewitt. I paid JH and then went about my way expecting to pay IRS. When the IRS payment was pulled from my checking account, it was a $760 debit. I called JH and was informed by Von that he was unable to "read my mind" when it came to the tax credit. I went through the proper complaint form procedure and got a Customer Service representative who claimed that until Mar 15th the government did not inform them of the tax credit. I asked why I was not informed that my tax payment had changed. The agent informed me that they had "called" me. She could not tell me if someone had called or left a message. This is, apparently, top secret information or a lie. I never received a call or a voice mail from this office. I asked for a refund on my $175 payment and was given back a mere $35. I was not prepared to pay the IRS $760. I was prepared to pay them $508. This is a substantial mix-up by a certified tax preparer and a substantial mix-up in my checking account. If I had not paid more attention to it. I could have bounced several checks causing more damage.
I made a purchase through Western Union and was told they could not verify who I was and the transaction would be cancelled. They would send a fax to my bank, IPower to have the funds released. Over the weekend (3/16-3/19), I have spent well over 10 hours on the phone trying to get my money back. WU faxes to the number provided by IPower and the bank is not receiving it. I talked to a rep and they told me they can't find the fax. I talked to another rep and they told me that it takes 24-48 hours to process and they won't see it until then. Here it is 3/19 and my money is still not back in my account. At the same time, I am being charged $2 for each call made to the bank which brought my balance down considerably. On the voice prompt, it says that I will be charged a fee of $0.00 to review my account and would I like to continue. I am out $242 and it appears that they are going to make me wait the 15 days which puts me in a financial bind.
On Feb. 20th, I went to Jackson Hewitt to get my taxes done. Since I had a K-1, I asked up front if they would be able to do it and they said yes. Several hours later, she said that it was ready and asked if I wanted it to be sent electronically and I said no, that I would review it and mail it. I was told that I would have to pay up front before she could print it out, so I paid $257.00. Upon receiving the forms, I found that it was incorrect due to the K-1. They were not able to provide me with the necessary forms to file. I was told I would receive a full refund of $257.00, which has not happened as of 4/15/10. When I called them, they told me that it was approved and went to the Corporate Office and that it was being processed. Two trips and several calls later, we are still waiting.
I went to have my taxes done last night (04/13/2010), I filed 1099. The preparer Ryan was incompetent! After 2 hours of referring to his instruction book and calling someone named Frank every 10 minutes for help, I finally asked him if he has ever done a 1099 before. He said yes, but not with deductions. I told him a 1099 is all about deductions. All in all, I spent 3 hours there and he asked me to come back today to have another preparer look at my return. Also, the cost was unbelievable. I paid $99.00 last year and this year, they charged $300. There is no way I will ever set foot in another J-H office. I am very disappointed because last year, they did such a good job and it seems like this year they have no one of any skill set working for them.
My encounter with Jackson Hewitt happened on 1/28/10. It had been recommended to me that I use a professional preparer this year since I had paid off a mobile home and was eligible for the home buyers credit. I opted to have a "pro" do my taxes rather than use turbo tax, so I could be sure no mistakes were made. In retrospect, I should have done it myself because my preparer, Jeff, was anything but professional. Jeff was very unorganized as he prepared my taxes and seemed nervous and agitated. He kept misplacing papers. He was up and down from his desk many times, would take papers with him, return to his desk without the papers and forgot where he put them. He checked his cell phone several times for personal messages while I sat there waiting for him to finish. It took about an hour. My total fee was $248.95. I did not have the money up front, so I was told it would be deducted from the check I received from the IRS. I was told it would take about 5-7 weeks to receive my check because of the house buying credit. I left feeling very worried that something was terribly wrong. I was right. On March 11th, I received a letter from the IRS stating that form 5405 was not filled out completely. I brought the letter back to the office. Jeff was not there. James took a look at it. I returned a couple of days later so Jeff could handle the problem. It turns out that the form in question was missing my full address after calling the IRS to inquire about what was wrong. I couldn't believe that he would overlook such an obvious part of this form. But remembering his agitated state at the time, he prepared my return, again, I knew something as going to be wrong. He told me that it would now be another 8-12 weeks before I would see my return! I was highly PO'd. It had already been 6 weeks and now, because of his stupid mistake, I would have to wait another 2-3 months! Well, I filed a complaint through the 800 number I was given and was contacted by the office manager Julianna. I explained the situation and thought that I deserved a full or even partial refund due to his costly mistake. I could have done a better more thorough job myself using turbo tax I explained. She said she would have to speak with her boss and that she would have him call me. Never got a call. Julianna, by the way, was very rude about the whole thing and very unprofessional in her handling of the situation. To make a long story short, I have subsequently called the 800 number 4 times to complain and speak to a district manager or store owner. They always say they can only e-mail that person and refuse to give me a name or phone # so I can call. They say I will be contacted within 3-5 business days and no call ever comes. I have been through this waiting period of 3-5 days now 4 times. I call the complaint line and its like starting over every time! They also get rude when you ask them for a phone number that you can call since no one ever calls back like they say they will. This last time, I said I was going to call the BBB and the girl just said Fine,do what you gotta do! What an outfit. I highly suggest to everyone out there...Do not use Jackson Hewitt as your tax preparer! So now it appears I will be paying these incompetents $248.95 for something I could have done myself for $30 or so. I would very much like to speak with an attorney about this. I feel there must certainly be a class action lawsuit possible after reading all the horror stories from others that have used JH sevices. I was planning on having my return money on time because I have recently become disabled from 2 major back surgeries and am unemployed as a result. It caused economic hardship and stressed me out tremendously at a time that I need to be convalescing.
My son bought a house right after the first of the year. I suggested that he use a tax service since he was filing for the First Time Home Buyers Credit. That was the first mistake. This was 12 weeks ago. He was told he would have his refund in about six weeks. He called after eight weeks and they told him that it could take up to 12 weeks. Well, today after about 12 weeks, they called on April 13th to say they have his tax papers and he needs to come and get them to sign them and mail them. When he called and ask the status of his refund, they never mentioned this. Today, I called and talked with a lady who identified herself as the owner, and she said that they called and left him a message the day he had them filled out to come and sign the papers, a message he never got. So my question was, "You make one attempt to call someone after you have charged them $300 and that is it?" No, she informed me that they go through their files once a week and contact people who need to come back in. So I asked if they had missed calling him every week for 12 weeks now, and she said she did not know what happened or if he even called and checked the status. I explained that as far as determining if he called was not a problem since he has a cell phone with detailed records we can get. He had to go to Fayetteville yesterday to work and the 15th is day after tomorrow. She said they intend to overnight him the papers. That is just fine, but she cannot get back the last 12 weeks they have set in her office. I mean seriously, in 12 weeks you could have at least sent a notice in the mail, right? I asked if she intended to refund any of his money and she stated he would get his refund and I said, "No, what I mean is do you intend to refund at least part of the $300 fee?" The answer, of course, was, "No. We are overnighting the papers." I am not sure what kind of action we can take but this type of doing business should not be allowed without consequences. You or I would not get by with being 12 weeks late by forgetting to mail our tax returns.
I filed my taxes on 1/25/10 and was told 15 days to get them back. I explain to the guy who prepared them, it was a paper form he informed ms 15 days! 16 days later, I called and was told 5-7 weeks since it was a paper form. Now keep in mind, I paid 249.95 to have them filed today is 4/11 and still no, takes 11 weeks later. I called the IRS, they say they don't have anything for me. I called Jackson Hewitt and they says the IRS has it and they haven't posted it yet. I have 2 friend who filed head of house hold and home tax credit same as I did and both have there taxes back, one filed 2/11 and she has had her taxes 2 weeks the other filed in March and got her return back last week. Why am I so different, I have to wait 11 weeks and counting.
I am a long time customer of Jackson Hewitt; they have prepared my taxes for the past 3 years, possibly 4 years. This year I am going through a divorce and my husband and I are filing joint for the taxes of 2009. My husband dropped off all of our paperwork and I contacted the person who was working on our taxes for which we owe, which I do not understand and when I asked, Ron kind of stumble through the explanation, then he stated that we had casino winnings that have taxes owed on them. I have not won any money at a casino. I asked for a copy of this paperwork to submit to my Attorney handling the divorce and Ron's comment was ,"Well, I cannot give you that information as your husband submitted it." I stated, "Well, it's being submitted with my taxes for 2009 and it's marital assets!" Ron was rude and he actually hung up on me. The damage is that Ron, who is preparing tax returns, and representing Jackson Hewitt is refusing to provide paperwork which I am entitled to as I am having to pay half the taxes on this amount of winnings my husband obtained in 2009 and I did not collect any proceeds. No tax preparer should ever act in this manner as I am a paying customer and will be charged about $280 for this office to prepare my taxes. Due to their bad business decisions, I should not pay Jackson Hewitt fee's for preparing my tax return for 2009. This is very poor customer service. Also, they refused to provide me with my legal information. I work two jobs and I am on my own and struggling. This type of treatment is unacceptable.
On 1/25/10 I went to the establishment listed above to get my taxes processed for the first time. At the time I spoke with a representative who filed all of my paperwork. No detailed information was stated at the beginning clarifying what the process fees were. After going through with the entire process, my taxes were done via e-file. I received a booklet with all of my information and was told the federal refund would return in approximately 7 business days. As stated my refund arrived on 2/2/10. I was supposed to receive $3,433, but instead I received $3,025.05. The fees I was charged were $407.95. A few days later I received my state return. I was supposed to receive $730, but instead I received $720. So $10 was deducted from it. This was my first experience filing with a tax service and I feel they were not honest with me from the beginning. Would someone please let me know if this is legal, and if not what rights do I have? As a result of this incident it has confused me more on what a reasonable fee is when getting my taxes done. It also cost me money which could have been used to assist me in getting out of debt.
I filed my taxes on February 12, 2010 and was promised to be refunded by RAL within 1-2 days. The very next morning at 10:00AM, Jackson Hewitt called and informed me that my refund was paid and funds were loaded on my ipower card. I checked my card online about 5:00 that evening and found that only $100 was on the card. When I called Jackson Hewitt back, they had no explanation and directed me to ipower customer service and Republic Bank. I got the runaround with Republic Bank and no help at all with ipower customer service and ipower supervisors. Republic Bank finally referred me to Meta Bank which stated I needed to call Jackson Hewitt. After going round and round in a circle for days and not being able to find anyone to take ownership of the situation, I found that the card was being credited and then debited several times, and ipower customer service stated they realized an error was there but could not give me any information. Republic Bank informed me that they can see the error and that Meta Bank had charged me twice for fees and I need to contact Meta Bank for correction. Meta stated that if there is an error it would iron itself out after the taxes are completely paid and that my card would be refunded. When I did not get a refund, I called Meta Bank and spoke with Crystal on March 23, 2010 who stated I would receive a call from them in 2 days. I also sent them an email requesting the refund of all fees, since RAL was not done in a timely manner and they still owe me money. When they loaded the card with some funds back on February 25, I decided to withdraw them before they took them back again. When ipower found that I had taken the funds off, they questioned why I did it. At that time I told them that I did not trust them and that they owed me more money. I told them that per Republic Bank, they had doubled my fees and I wanted the fees refunded which is about $492.00 plus they needed to refund all RAL fees, since it was not processed in a timely manner and still not correct. To this date, I have not received help from anyone. I informed Meta Bank that they are violating all Federal laws and need to find my money and refund me. I have not received any response from Meta Bank. By holding my money this way, they have caused me tremendous stress, pain, and suffering. I needed my money quickly, because I am not getting paid due to being on disability from an accident. These funds were needed to provide food and pay bills and maintain my household for me and my disabled daughter. These people are cold, have poor customer service, and offer no help at all.
I filed my taxes with this office for 2007 and 2008. I purchased the audit protection package from them. In 2007 without my knowledge, I was audited and was taken to collections by the IRS. They never did anything to back up there services which I payed for. In 2008, I filed my taxes with them again and was not told about the 2007 audit and they never submitted the tax forms after filing. I did not find out any of this until I filed in 2009. Lost over $4,000 dollars in tax refunds.
I had never used this company before but because they were recommended to me, I thought I'd give them a try. First of all, I had called ahead of time to make an appointment and get a rough idea of how much they would charge. When I got there, they were not aware of my appointment and when we had finished, they charged me $343.00 after I was estimated to be about $150.00. They filed my taxes electronically and the next day, I received a phone call to say that my grandson whom I claimed had been claimed by someone else. I asked them to file anyway and let the IRS determine who should claim him. We again had to go back and resign everything and this time file by paper. I had received my federal check minus their fee of $43.00 the week of March 22, 2010. This made me wonder what happened to my state check. I contacted the Division of Revenue to find that they had never received it. I contacted Jackson Hewitt and spoke with Anna, the tax preparer, to find out that her boss (Rob) told her to hold my return until they received their fee from my Federal Return. She explained to me that this was not a normal process and she didn't know why clients are not told this up front. I then contacted Rob and explained to him what happened and he said he didn't know why Anna was saying what she had said to me. This was very unprofessional and I will never use them again nor recommend them to anyone.
I brought Jackson Hewitt gold plan in 2008. They did not enter my SSA. I got a tax bill from IRS. Sheryl told me she could put in a claim but Jackson Hewitt would turn it down because I sign the tax form. I think they should be liable because I pay them over $300.00 to prepare my taxes right. Just because they do not put information in when you give it to them that should not be your fault. It is theirs. I am stressed and I owe $1,052.00 to IRS that I do not have and I am worried about this. I got loss of sleep.
I have always done my taxes myself but this year I decided to have Jackson Hewitt do them for me since I just didn't have the time to fuss with it because of a move and school. After paying $230 for them to do my taxes, I go retrieve the online 1040 form so I can fill out my FAFSA for school and I discover they had given me someone else's forms and information yet I didn't have mine. I called Jackson Hewitt immediately after seeing this, and drove there to turn in this other person's information and to find out where mine ended up. I was able to see this person's address, ssn, and about the 20 other some odd pages they make you fill out and sign when they do your taxes, and I was fumed because if I could see theirs, then they could see mine. I also called my bank and the credit bureau to put watches on my account since my SSN surely didn't end up with me. When I got the the Jackson Hewitt office, they were like "oops sorry" and couldn't tell me where my information ended up. And sorry after paying them $230 to handle my personal information, "oops, sorry" doesn't exactly cut it. So after dealing with corporate and what not, I got $75 dollars back and a coupon for $50 off my next tax fee. Like I will ever have anyone do my taxes again, let alone them. So I would like to sincerely thank Jackson Hewitt for losing my information and effectively ** with and interfering with my life.
My 2006 tax return was incorrect by the IRS. After I went to Jackson-Hewitt, they admitted the mistake and gave me a check on the spot for $5000.00 and advised me that was the extent of their liability. By the time the IRS contacted me, the penalties and interest was almost $45.000. I have paid the amount down, and I am paying $500.00 a month. At this rate, I will not live long enough to satisfy the balance.
They did my Fed and State wrong! The first person didn't understand the questions and answered without even asking me the questions. I'm not sure if he didn't understand English or how to work the software. The office receptionist had to help all the employees, because none of them know what they were doing. I was in there for over an hour, and he did it all wrong. Once I discovered that they did my taxes wrong--by going online and doing them myself--it took all day for them to track down the manager to get the code to fill the amendment free of charge. They fixed the Federal, however, not the State--the lady said that the Federal offset the state---which is incorrect! She didn't know what she was doing. She locked up the system, so the state of IL has to determine how much I am getting back! I paid for a service to get this down quickly, but what a pain this has been! I will never go back to them again in my life and would never recommend them, not even to my worst enemy! When I asked for my money because they added no value, she said that they couldn't because I used a coupon when I paid for the services. What? They did them wrong. Why should I have to pay for that? The owner seemed to have issues of his own and brought them into the store as well. The couple of times I was there, they were people waiting for payment from him for services other than taxes! They are horrible and should not even be allowed to be open and work on taxes at all! There was also someone else in there while I was waiting getting their taxes redone because they were done wrong! How can they be profitable if it is taking them 3 or 4 times to do something as simple as taxes? They needed no value. Just frustrated me to no end! I will never return and will continue to spread the word that they just hire anyone--doesn't matter if you cannot read or follow directions!
I paid to have taxes done on February 8, and I was to go direct deposit on or before February 26. Still, I have not received a federal refund. I called them, and they said it was going to be mailed. I asked why; my papers indicated direct deposit. She said my Bank of America must have been wrong. I said, "Not according to my copy of papers you gave me, or I would not have signed them." I've been banking there for years. Numbers are right. I have never had any trouble like this before. I just think you all should keep and eye on this firm. I am a senior citizen, and I don't like being pushed around. If I don't get my return, I will let you know or the local media. Thank you.
I have been a customer with them from 2000-2010. I always thought that they were charging too much. They never want to itemized your expenses. I think your return could have been larger. They always want to get you out. Their service is bad. I have four children. I think I should have got more to take care of my children.
I was looking under a search engine to find Jackson Hewitt contact number, so I can make an appointment to file my taxes. Me and my husband have used them for a couple of years, and we always apply for the RAL. I notice in the search engine complaints under Consumer Affairs about them still pushing RAL loans, but their banks are not honoring them, and Jackson Hewitt (H&R Block included in these claims) is still charging their customers for the service. I read all the complaints that were posted, and told my husband we should try to file ourselves, since banks are not doing the RAL loans (H&R Block included). I went to IRS.gov, and noticed that companies are promoting free online tax return, if you make under $57,000 for the year. I picked Turbo Tax Freedom Edition. It was so easy. Why have I never used this before, instead paying all the high fees from Jackson Hewitt. Because my family made less than $57,000, the fed tax was free, and my state filing was only $14.95! My total fees to file my husband and me, plus five kids was only $14.95! To top this off, we have gotten back more then we thought! Plus, Jackson Hewitt and H&R block have been telling people, since they did not qualify for the RAL, they should get a check in 8 to 17 days or something. Turbo Tax has an option for direct deposit, and you will get your tax return deposited in a week! We did this, and received our money in about four days! I thought I couldn't do this because I'm bad with math and stuff, but Turbo Tax walks you through each step, with very easy directions to follow, plus, I had my kids bugging me when I was filing our taxes, and still was able to do it! I can't get over the Jackson Hewitt and H&R Block price. Thank you to all the people who threw the red flag on them. I'm sorry they had to learn the hard way, but thank you for posting your comments. If you didn't, I would have never looked under other options to do my taxes. For people who are wanting RAL loans, or to do their taxes with them, please think again. Go under IRS.gov, and look for other ways to do your taxes. It's not hard. If I could do it with my kids bugging me, and being dumb with numbers, then you can!
I had taxes done two years. The first year, federal found a mistake they made. In 2008, I went back because they said they wanted to make it better. When she did the taxes, I was told we owed the state money. I told her I wanted it checked by a manager. The manager said it was done correct. Later that year, I got information from the state to find out all the taxes were done wrong. They said they would pay the tax interest and never did. They never called back.
I was charged a total of $268.00 to have my taxes prepared. They did let me use a coupon that they printed off line for $25.00 to bring it down to $243.00. I only had a W2 form and interest from a savings account to claim. I also claim 1 dependent and I was told I was eligible for earned income credit. When I was told at the end how much I owed, I was shocked! When I called the next day to find out if there could have been a mistake, I was told no and that the earned income credit form was expensive ($109.00). I feel I've been ripped off for something that I was eligible for and I should not have to pay such an outrageous amount to have taxes done that only took 30 minutes to do. I have gone to Jackson Hewitt for 8 years to have my taxes done. I will never go back and will let all my friends know.
I have had my taxes completed by JH for the last nine years. Last year, I received a notice from the IRS that some income was not reported. I returned with my package to Jackson Hewitt and they amended the return. It turns out that I was over paid my refund. So at that point, I owed the IRS almost $2000.00. This year, I received a notice from the IRS about the 2007 payable 2008 tax refund. Again,they showed unreported income and said I owed them 661.00 for that year also. I took my taxes for a second look at H&R Block and they identified several mistakes made the past two years. There was income added incorrectly, income counted as self employment that was not, retirement funds cashed out added incorrectly, income put under expenses and of course omissions of income. These w2s were in the packet, just not added into the return. As a result, I now owe the IRS thousands of dollars. I have been laid off and collecting unemployment on and off for the past two years. I have contacted many people at JH and do not receive call back. It appears they do not care about the problem and are making no moves to resolve the issue. I just left them another message telling them if they do not attempt to address and resolve the issues they have caused me, I am going to start picketing the local offices with my friends, with sign boards that read "Jackson Hewitt cost me thousands of dollars to the IRS." I feel that should at least refund my preparation fees, and pay the penalties and interest that they have caused. I will never never go to have taxes prepared by them again and I will tell everyone I can that they are risking their financial security by dealing with Jackson Hewitt.
Jackson Hewitt prepared my taxes at the cost of $122.00 (after the $25.00 coupon) and told me that the money would be available in 10 business days on an ACE Cash Visa card. I specifically asked if there would be charges to use the card and if I could take the whole amount at once. G L Martin, the tax preparer, said that I could and there shouldn't be any charges. Well, the card came and it only had $10.00 on it instead of the full amount of the tax return! The ACE Cash card company is of zero help! They stated that the money was returned to the original depositor and charged me 50 cents to look at my deposit! Then I called Jackson Hewitt and they could not help either! I was told by both places to call the IRS for help. I do not recommend using Jackson Hewitt or ACE Cash Card. They are both scam artist, in my opinion!
I filed my taxes as I did every year with two measly returns and three dependents. I expected the same treatment as always. Next day direct deposit, simple form, no itemizing. Imagine my surprise when this year, I didn't qualify for a next day return! No reason other than they switched from one bank to another and this bank didn't consider me qualified. How is that possible with a straight return? No itemizing! The easy form? I am positively furious and will never use this company again. Ever!
I normally have my taxes prepared at H&R Block and my normal fee for having them completed and filed is $150. I was induced to try out Jackson Hewitt's tax preparation services because they advertised that if you had your taxes prepared at H&R Block, they would prepared your taxes for $50 less. When I called to confirm the promotion they said it was correct as long as I had a receipt from my prior year’s tax preparation. There was also a $25 off tax preparation services from Jackson Hewitt in the paper and I asked if I could also use that coupon. They said it was not a conflict to take advantage of both promotions. Accordingly, I went to the Wal-Mart location in E Stroudsburg and submitted all of my paperwork and whereas I assumed my tax preparation bill would be $75 ($150 paid at H&R Block less the $50 promotion and less $25 for the coupon). I was told my bill was for $225 and they would then deduct the $75, making my bill $150. No less than I would have paid at H&R Block. They argued that their fees are higher than H&R Block’s and that they were not promising that consumers would pay less than they actually paid for the same services at H&R Block. The advertisements are blatantly misleading. They need to alert consumers that their fees may in fact be higher than those charged by H&R Block for the same services and that consumers may not actually pay $50 less when all is said and done. In this case my damages would have been $25 if I had not ben able to use the additional coupon. But since they allowed me to use the coupon, the resulting fees paid were the same as I would have paid at H&R Block. The issue is that I clearly was lead to believe I was going to save at least $50 from my taxes and I did not save any money by trying their services. There may be others who actually may end up paying more for their tax preparation as a result of the misleading advertisements.
I saw their ads on TV and thought I would try them. So I went to their office and they stated that I could have them back in three days. So I filed with them. They gave me a 1800 number to check but the number did not work. So I called and checked on them and was told they had to resubmit them, to call back and when I called, they told me they had to resubmit them again. So I asked if I could have them back but was told that I couldn't have them back. I feel that I was given the runaround. I told them that this would be the last time I would use them. I would say that the staff of the office that I used did try to help me but the company Jackson Hewitt did not try to solve the problem. I would not send anyone to file their taxes with them. I am still waiting for them to be released from the bank. They are using the bank they were using. They changed to other one. They also charge a very high charge. I did them there so I could get them back so that I could pay my electric bill and some other bills and to help other family members but was unable to.
We went in on the 27th of January to Jackson Hewitt tax service and filed our taxes. We were told that we would get them back by the 5th or the 12th of February. We were supposed to receive our refund on a card direct deposit by the 12th at the latest and it was released by the IRS on the 12th, yet it never showed up on our card so we started calling and checking to see what the problem is. We finally got in touch with the office where they prepared our taxes and we talked with the office manager there who told us he didn’t know where our refund was, and we asked him for the account number it was deposited to and he gave us the account number which was not our account number. So someone else has our refund and he told us he would call the bank and have them put a stop on it, and then he would be able to get us a check issued. Well, we waited 6 days and called him back and he told us he don’t know where the money is and that he will call the bank and have them stop it, but he had already told us that the week before now. He said it will be another 5 days we have to wait. We have been charged $450 and we did get the gold guarantee and he said we would not be refunded any of that, that it wasn’t their mistake. Well, we didn’t enter the wrong account number. One of their preparers entered the wrong account number and so we are the ones that lose and are being charged a large amount of money for their mistake, not ours. Their gold guarantee is bogus, I will never use their service again nor will I recommend them to anyone else. I will tell everyone I can how they lie! I will make sure everyone I know hears about my experience with them and I know there are plenty of others who have had the same thing happen to them in their dealings with Jackson Hewitt.
My husband and I filed our taxes this year with Jackson Hewitt on February 1st. We were told that JH was not doing the 24-48 RAL return this year. After going to JH for 16 years and always getting the RAL 24-48 hour return, we were told we would definitely get the return in 3-5 days. We were denied for no reason. It is now the 15th and still nothing! After calling JH numerous times and going to their office, we are still getting the runaround about what's what. The manager at our JH branch has been nothing but rude when we had asked for answers to our questions. No one knows anything , nor do they want to try and research it for their clients. At this point, my husband has just gotten off the phone with the bank, River City, that issues the loans this year for JH and spoke to the Supervisor and he said that they were not approving anyone for the loan except people that have a prior banking history with them. Last year's bank, Santa Barbara, that JH went with is now bankrupt for giving out the RAL's to people that owed money. My husband & I never owed money. And why wouldn't Jackson Hewitt tell us this beforehand about the 3-5 day denial without previous history with their new bank partners?. The Supervisor said that he is unsure of why the IRS is holding our money, since their computer system reports that there is no holds or problems with our return and that we should've received our return last Friday, the 12th. He added that we would definitely receive it this Friday, the 19th. I have to wonder if that's true.
I was an employee for this company. I took all three required courses. I was hired as an office manager from the beginning, was not paid for management wages, which was only .25 cents more than regular preparer wages. I was also told that I would be paid more on my next check which did not happen. I was also charged for uniform shirts that I never received. I did get that money back, only after I quit. While still working there, I asked for that money back, and did not receive it until I quit and said I was going to the labor board. I was not paid correctly; my check was missing a total of 22 hours, I did not receive that for another week. Some employees did not receive their paychecks until the following pay day which is bi-weekly. I also never received my overtime pay, which was used as regular pay. This company is notorious for the employees not being paid on time, or sometimes not at all, some even have been paid with checks that bounced. The customer complaints are unreal. Last year's bank they were using refused to do business with them due to NSF. They were telling customers and employers that the bank was going bankrupt. A customer came in one day and said she called the number on her paperwork, which mistakenly was the bank they claimed went bankrupt! It was clearly a lie. There are numerous employees working there that do tax fraud. They all still work there, he just moves them to different stores! The register drawer at this particular store was always open. It was broken, and again Richard ** was fully aware of this as I told him myself. He showed a lack of concern. The store manager Tawnya ** wanted to write people up for missing money, ranging from amounts of $20 to $5. The drawer was always open?! Hello! How do we know she didn't take the money? This Jackson Hewitt franchise is clearly unorganized, and ran by a family that is dishonest. Also this franchise is giving all JHs a bad reputation, and name. I had many customers come in and complain, and that they would never do their taxes with JH, and would tell all family and friends not to either. We were "supposed" to have employee contracts. They would not tell us our wages until we got the "contract". This was in January that we were hired; the contract was written up on January 4, 2010. We were to turn them in on or before January 15, 2010, or it would be considered not valid. I did not receive the contract until January 23, 2010. I did not sign this contract, as to me it was already null and void since I did not receive it as I was supposed to. We did not receive any training. I was put to work on January 4, 2010. I had no training at all, and worked for 10 hours with no OT paid out to me still to this date. We are to be paid on Saturdays at 7 pm, they claim, which is normal business hours. They close at 7, most of them close a few minutes earlier than 7 due to management meetings, so in reality most paychecks do not get handed out until Sundays. The pay checks go to the area in which you work, not at the store you work! You can work in Cheraw and live in Hartsville, not get your check because you are working until 7. So clearly, the pay day is a farce. There was too much dishonesty in this company with upper management and owners that I felt it necessary to leave my position. I also feel it is my duty to future employees and future customers to tell what is going on in this Jackson Hewitt franchise.
All of 2009 I have been on unemployment. I have a very easy tax return (i.e., single, no deductions, no other income, etc.) I went to Jackson Hewitt in Gresham, Oregon on 1/16/10 to get an estimate on how much my tax would cost to be prepared. Charles H. said $100.00. I said ok but the cost was actually $123.00. That did not make me happy but I paid it. About two weeks later, there was an advertisement on the television from Jackson Hewitt. The advertisement states that they would do your taxes for $50.00 less what a person paid last year from H&R Block, etc. So I called the manager at Jackson Hewitt (Shawna C.). I told her the situation and that I had my receipt from last year from H&R Block and I would like them to honor their advertisement. She kept telling me that she would check with the regional manager and would get back to me the same day. She never got back to me. I kept calling Shawna and finally she said that her regional manager was out of town but that she would leave him a message and e-mail but that he does not check his e-mail. What manager does not check their e-mails? Anyway, I have not heard from them at all. I am out about $24.00 because Jackson Hewitt is not honoring their advertisements. Ironically, if they would just pay me the $24.00, it would bring my balance to what the initial estimate was to begin with. Most companies (especially nowadays) would want to make their customers happy. I guess Jackson Hewitt is not concerned about their customers nor should they be considered to be a professional establishment.
We went to Mr. ** on January 28, 2010, to file our taxes. He told me that we missed the deadline for the "next day" check, but we could get an "assisted refund" for about $44.00, through Meta Bank. I agreed to this, but then he said it was denied. The next option was to get a check in his office on February 8, 2010, or get the refund directly from the IRS at no charge, by February 12, 2010. We chose the check on the 8th, which has still to get there. I have called his number each day, and it is an answering service, which says he will call back. I am still awaiting a call back on the 11th. Supposedly, we could have had the government direct deposit by tomorrow the 12th, for no fee. Meanwhile, he charged us $247.95. For what? We have been clients of Jackson Hewitt for several years now (starting with them about 5 or 6 years ago in Toms River without a problem). This year, Mr. ** seemed to have rushed me through the process, and we are left high and dry thus far. What is our recourse regarding these fees?
My husband and I went to Jackson Hewitt Tax Service on 1-30-10 to have my taxes prepared. The preparer completed all of the paperwork and stated that our state/federal taxes will be directly deposited in our bank account as we have requested. We were told that the tax service fees would be deducted from our federal return before it goes into our account. This is the agreement that we had with Jackson Hewitt. Upon waiting for our funds to be deposited into our account, we found out that Jackson Hewitt did not take the refund from our federal return, to which we had agreed. They took it from our state taxes, to which we had not discussed with them. After checking my Iowa revenue website and seeing that my refund had been deposited into my account, I purchased gas and other items, only to find, after an overdraft on my account, that Jackson Hewitt had taken my state refund. I am very angry and will never file taxes with Jackson Hewitt ever again. I will not recommend this tax service to anyone. This company has some very shady practices that need to be stopped. When I contacted Jackson Hewitt, the office manager stated that I had signed a paper stating that I wanted my fees taken from my state refund. I explained to her that this is not what was discussed with the preparer. This has caused my account to be overdrawn and I have been charged several overdraft fees.
I went in January 25th to do my taxes, I ask for the 1 to 5 day return she said ok, Dawn called me the next day saying I was declined, I said why I been going to Jackson Hewitt for 11 years, she said problem because you got the previous loan on January 4th, she said a lot of people called an was complaining and that Jackson Hewitt has a new bank (republican) all of my years going there I haven't had a problem. I don't see that if it’s a loan and you paying extra money why doesn't the bank give you the money. She told me I have to wait for the irs to release my money in order to get my money. Ok so what’s the use of going thru Jackson Hewitt if I have to wait for the irs. I am so mad because I had important things to do. She told me I should receive my money by February 5th. It’s now February 11th charging me all this money for nothing. One of my friends did her taxes after me with Jackson Hewitt and she got her money on the 5th. How that happen. I don’t know.
My wife and I contacted our local Jackson Hewitt and H&R Block. Jackson Hewitt stated that with our taxes (children, mortgage, property taxes, etc.), we would expect to pay $39 up to $200 max if it's really complicated, and they guarantee the largest refund through some special software. So, we went with Jackson Hewitt and after the first person messed up and did everything in the wrong screen, forgot to enter our property tax, and something else. Another person redid our taxes with a higher return then after three and a half hours, they hit us with a $365 bill! After telling them what to do then, coupons appeared out of nowhere for $100 total off. They gave us a guilt trip for walking out like we wasted their time. We went home and went on H&R Block.com and did our taxes for $15.00 and got $100 more back.
My husband and I went to get our taxes done with one W-2 and one investment paper with no write offs. They charged us over $500 to do our taxes. They don't tell you this until they are done. It's not like I was getting a lot of money back so they took half of my tax money. What a rip off.
I went to file my taxes on Jan. 30, 2010 and I was supposed to get my refund in one to five days. I got ripped off. I paid $264 for tax preparation fee, $10 for office check fee to Jackson Hewitt, and $20 for data and document storage fee which equal to $294 without including bank fees. Bank fees are $90.34 for an RAL check. I haven't gotten my refund yet that's why I am upset. I spoke to the manager named Tere. I complained to her that as soon as the preparer started doing my interview, she was making mistake after mistake, and it took her more than one hour to finish. I didn't like the way she was doing her job. She took forever, was lost along the way, and she had to be calling her co-worker for help which wasn't too much of a help. I told the preparer that I wasn't satisfied with her work. After going through the stress of her making mistake after mistake, she said, "You have to sign at least 10 times." I had to tell her to explain to me what the was doing because she didn't explain nothing whatsoever. I said to her again, "I wasn't satisfied!" I called on Monday to see if my refund was approved and they gave me another number to call the corporate office. So I called and they told me that they didn't have anything on file. I called back to the tax office and there was nothing. So I called Tuesday to the tax office and asked about my refund. They told me it was on hold because there was a discrepancy and they were going to send it again. So I called again to the corporate office and they told me again that it hasn't been filed. Whats going on? So on Wednesday, I called again and they told me that they had made a mistake to add another note to my taxes. My taxes were filed until Thursday, instead of Saturday. My "RAL" refund wasn't approved by the bank "Republic Bank" because of the preparer who made mistake after mistake. Hence, my refund is taking longer than I expected--four days more. I had to call the district manager which he told me that I was only upset because my refund wasn't issued on one business day. I told him that I expected my refund within one to five days! I wasn't satisfied at all with the work they had done. He told me that I was only getting a refund from the bank $40.34 since the RAL wasn't approved. Now, I have to wait after the 12th through the 18th to receive my refund. They ripped me off. I could have gone to H&R Block cost less and would have gotten my refund sooner. I was going to pay my bills my truck payment. This has delayed all my payments. They are not explaining correctly. The district manager wasn't too much of a help. He told me that I would get a discount for next year's income. But I'm not going there next year. This is the first and last time I go there. The only reason I went there because I was supposed to get my RAL in one to five business days! Don't go to Jackson Hewitt!
It's only been my second year working with Jackson Hewitt. I was referred by a friend and did not have any problems when I filed for 2009. On Jan 30th, again at the same time I filed last year, I brought everything I needed, completed my return, and signed the electronic keypad. The tax preparer printed out my papers as to say I didn't receive all the same papers as I did last year not knowing if I was supposed to or not. He did not state that they were doing anything differently, so I didn't ask. I called last week on the 7th see if my check had came in. The preparer that filed my return stated, "It looks as if your RAL was declined and it would be another week or two." Then he said, "Let me see when your disbursement date is," which he said would be Friday, the 12th. I replied, "I didn't apply for the RAL, I applied for the AR." This is what I applied for, that same thing last year and I got my refund in five days. The check was at the office waiting on the 5th of February. I asked him if I would get charged for RAL that I didn't apply for and he said, "No, but my papers state that if you apply for it and are declined, you still will be charged the fifty something dollars." Here it is, February 9th and still there's no check. I've called the teletax number through Jackson Hewitt and the IRS and I can't get any info about my money because it says the social security number has not yet reached their system, so I guess I'm waiting it out until Friday, February 12th. I know one thing for sure. I don't recommend them to anyone and this will be my last year filing with them.
How is this? I have been working for this company for three years, When it comes to payroll, they're doing the same thing, taking peoples' money with no answer. I work 40 hours for $8.00 an hour. They told my boss that this year they are taking an hour or half an hour off even if I don't take a break. They are ripping everyone off. I am going to find a lawyer to help me. They are not right. I am a single mother of four children, one in college. I need every penny I earn. I don't work for free. This is America.
More of the same. I had Jackson Hewitt prepare my taxes this year on February 4th. Unlike most of you, I was told upon arrival that this branch was doing RAL for 2010. At first, my preparer told me that no Jackson Hewitt was doing RALs. However, my brother had just gone to a Syracuse branch three days before this and had in fact gotten an RAL and had his money in 15 hours. The branch I visited said that they wouldn't do RAL so I accepted the 8-15 day refund and she prepared my taxes. My refund amount was a nice surprise and I figured on having it by the following week. I have had a trip to New Orleans planned for several months now, including two job interviews the week of the 15th. As of yesterday, the IRS hadn't even heard of me this tax year, which was already day 5 of my 8-15 day refund wait. This morning, I checked the IRS website again and they at least heard of me now. They are estimating my return by the 23rd! The 23rd? I did my taxes on the fourth! My entire trip is ruined and my job interviews will need to be cancelled. That's 19 days and from the sounds of what you're all saying here, I probably won't even see it by the 23rd! Then, to make matters worse, I asked to have it put on iPower card. It looks like that was another mistake. I thought it might speed up the process but if they don't even have a bank, then how will they even deposit it on my card? Let's get rid of the loan shark franchises!
We saw the commercial from Wall-mart to have your taxes done and cash your check there. So we went there and we spoke with someone. She was new so she had to have someone help and they said we didn't qualify for the child credit and we have 3 children and then we went for the RAL, so we could have our taxes back the next day. We were told that we would have our money at 9am the next day. Well, we called them and we were declined. They didn't know why, so we said we need our taxes back so we can go somewhere else to file. they said oh no we can't do that cause they already sent them in. When we found out that no, we could have gotten it back. It has been two weeks now and we are still waiting for our taxes. After being lied to, they kept saying oh it will be here the next day. It will be here the next day and it still has not come. We're promised again that it will be here this coming Friday. All we can do is hope. We need our money! Cause of this, we were promised our money a certain day so I used our rent money to pay bills cause we were promised it by a certain day. By now we're out of money and I have a 4-month old baby who needed diapers. We needed gas. We're down to one car cause my husbands motor blew. So my husband went down to Jackson Hewitt to get our money. He told them they would have to call the cops to get him to leave. Then they said oh if you write us a post dated check, we'll write you a check for some of your money. So he came to get me. I asked them why do I have to give a post dated check for my money that you owe us? And she said oh you don't have to. Finally we got half of our money and then my husband went down to the local IRS office and found that we do qualify for the child credit and we took it to H&R Block to have them fix their mess. We found out we have way more money coming back to us. Don't ever go through Jackson Hewitt. We tell everyone we cannot go there. We even stopped a lady at Wall-mart who was trying to go there and she threw the stuff away from them. I hope people will read this before they go, so this won't happen to them.
Just like every other complaint, I went in on January 31, 2009 to have my Tax Return done by Jackson-Hewitt. I expressed to the lady prior to coming in that I needed the refund quickly due to financial reasons. I have had Jackson Hewitt prepare my taxes for the last 6 years and have never had a problem getting my refund quickly. I set an appointment with the lady. When we completed my tax return, I stressed to her that I (as always) wanted the RAL return. The next morning, I received a call stating that I had been declined by their bank, and that it would be 8-15 business days before I could expect it. Not sure why, since my credit is better than it has been in the past. Now I have spent $394.00 to have J-H prepare my taxes for nothing. My tax return was simple and I could have saved the $394.00 by doing them myself. I believe there will come a day when we see Jackson Hewitt get caught with their hand in the cookie jar. This is not the way any business wants to treat their customers (loyal customers). I will not be allowing them to make my hard earned money ever again. They will make a load of money this year on all of their customers. God have mercy on Jackson-Hewitt.
I have been with Jackson Hewitt for 10 years getting my money the next day on ipower card. Well, this year it did not happen IRS approve me, the bank denied me. Why they know I could not do 24 hours? Why they didn't tell me I filed January 28th? Now, I have to wait 8-15 days, never had to do that before my question if IRS approved me. Why the bank hold the money they are going to get? Their money, well, all I have to say, it was a lot of disappointed people this year. I will not use them next year. I can do mine on line and get the 8-15 days with tax act and save all those bank fees I advised anyone that deal with them do the same.
I have read numerous complaints on this website about Jackson Hewitt supposedly defrauding people when it comes to RALs. Frankly, I think that many of these complaints are ridiculous. I don't understand how a person could not understand that when you apply for a RAL, you are applying for a loan that may or may not be approved based on whatever arbitrary criteria the bank decides. Also the bank is an entity that operates completely independently from Jackson Hewitt, so you can't blame Jackson Hewitt for your RAL being declined. They are using a new bank this year that obviously is using different criteria than the old bank. So this is why some people who have been approved in the past but are being declined this year. Banks are also becoming more strict with loans because of the economy. They cannot afford to lose money, especially now. And everyone should know, I would think, that 8-15 days means business days, as in Monday through Friday. I think all of these things are just basic common sense and these complaints are indicative of an epidemic in which many, if not most, consumers exhibit enormous ignorance. Do not be afraid to ask questions and do not ever leave any business interaction without fully understanding what is transpiring. It is your money, it is your responsibility to make sure you are fully informed of what is going on with it. One last thing, a lot of people seem to think they are still going to get charged for the RAL fee if it is declined. I was told by my Jackson Hewitt preparer that this amount would not be deducted from my return if the RAL was declined (which it was). When I receive my return, I will make sure that I was not charged that fee.
I filed my taxes at Jackson Hewitt as I have for many years with the thought that I would get my ral like I always have. I filed head of household and earned income for myself and 2 younger kids like every year. No extensive filing needed. After many frustrating calls with everyone saying "I don't know" and being put through to a bank that they use for credit cards that has absolutely nothing to do with the taxes. I called back and of course magically got disconnected. Still to this day have not received my taxes from them. Today being the 11th day, I called and the girl who did my taxes and is in charge of that store got offended because I am taking it out on Jackson Hewitt. She gave me a number that I actually got to talk to a human as where I have been asking all week and got their number that you couldn't talk to a human. Sounds pretty fishy to me. I told her and the guy I talked to that I have read the consumer complaints and she said this is the first she's heard of that.. Yeah I am just so sure. She claims that it's everywhere and this is the worst tax year. That's [a lie] because I work in a restaurant and talk to a lot of people and no one else has gone through this except for me and why; because I am the only one who used Jackson Hewitt. The guy gave me a line that I must owe someone money and that's why I haven't gotten it and i will get a letter in 8 to 15 days. Love that line 8 to 15 days! I contacted the IRS website and no problems there and I don't owe any money to anyone so how bout another story. I am fuming right now and getting ready to contact consumer lawyer. Anyone know any good ones please pass it on. Oh and my advise...Do not use them. They are a scam. Never again next year I will e-file like I should have. But like all of us, I really needed it. Good thing my son who by the way used Liberty Tax got his the next day, loaned me the money to pay my bills and rent.
I decided to have my taxes filed by Jackson Hewitt, because I had bought a house, gotten a divorce, and had a lot of paperwork for the year. After being sent from one office to another, I thought all was well. I was told I would have a check the next day. The phone call the next day said my RAL (next day check) was not approved, but that they could not tell me why. So I was told it would be another 8 days. Those 8 days have come and gone, so I called again, and now it is going to be another 13 days from what they say. So much for helping me with my taxes. If I had filed them myself, I would have received my money quicker.
I have been a returning customer with Jackson Hewitt Tax Services since 2007. I was new to the city and I wanted to file my taxes with a company I could trust. I have had the most fair experience with Jackson Hewitt in regards to the price for the services and dependability. I will never use Jackson Hewitt again! This year is the absolute worst experience I have ever had! The price for preparation is too expensive and when I questioned the reason for the exaggerated cost, I received no explanation. The only reason I decided to use a tax service was for the convenience of receiving a Refund Anticipation Loan without waiting for the IRS. The price for convenience seemed fair enough, therefore, was worth it. This year, I feel cheated and overcharged for a service that I did not receive. I was told that I was declined for the RAL and now I will have to wait 8-14 days (definitely 14 days). I did not need Jackson Hewitt to prepare my taxes. I have a bank account. I could have completed an e-file form online for $30, tops. I will never use Jackson Hewitt again!
I filed my taxes with Jackson Hewitt.I signed a contract for a loan for 8- 15 days, I did not receive my check with the time frame. There not phone number to contact the tax preparer because the phone number that is listed is disconnected 718-402 3686. I need to know if I am being charged the fee for the 8-15 day loan, being that I did not receive my check within that time and I called 1 -877 580-1040 and Kevin was not able to answer any questions that I have.
My refund was placed on an iPower card, which I had asked Keono to destroy 3 weeks prior. I got a loan placed on the iPower card, and I cannot get rid (cancel) the damn thing! iPower card Customer Service can be accessed through 1(866) 518-4722. And I have money on a card account that was not explained to be a binding means of receiving any monies from my refund. The offices are offering these services with no real idea that you would not be able to get direct deposit or check. I have no idea of the relationship; his advertisement reads like Jack-Hew is all part of this, but they quickly distance themselves at a sign of trouble. I need this card cancelled!
My wife and I were trying to decide whether or not to file our taxes online this year or if we should file with Jackson Hewitt like we did last year. We decided to do as we did last year and we went to Jackson Hewitt. We filled out the paperwork and selected the RAL just as we had before. After inputting all of our tax data, the lady quoted our refund to us. Then she informed us that "Obama won't let them provide the refund in the form of a RAL anymore". She also informed us that the quickest way to get our refund available was to get the assisted refund "AR" and have it direct deposited. And that my fees were going to come to around $400. They actually were a lot closer to $500. Little did I know that I was being charged for a service that is identical to the free IRS direct that comes with the basic filing and gives you your refund in the same amount of time. Also, I would have qualified to eFile for free online due to my income level for last year. So basically, Jackson Hewitt has stolen $500 from my family and I am quite pissed. I will never use their service again and will make sure that my friends, family and anyone who will listen never does either.
I went into Jackson Hewitt as I have done for the past ten (10) years to file my taxes. As I proceed to tell Ms. Ruby about how I wanted to file, she told me there's no 1-day loans. So I said OK and asked what the other options are there. She told me about the RAL! She prepared my taxes, and she even gave me a specific date, the fourth of February, to receive my refund! I got all papers signed and left. I started calling the 866 number that I had to check the status of my refund. But it is not accurate or updated regularly, because I went online and found out about the refund. I called the office of Jackson Hewitt to express my concerns over my refund and was told that I would just have to wait for their supervisor to say when the money is in and that the banks are doing credit checks since the economy in a recession! I'm like "What does the recession have to do with my money!" I have bills pending, food is needed in my home, the roof is leaking, and I thought I would have been able to handle some of this by now. I am seriously thinking of using another tax service next year! To me, I feel like Jackson Hewitt doesn't much value its loyal customers and the fact that we put our trust in them to provide a service which is not free or cheap!
For the previous two years before now, I used TurboTax online to do my tax return, and it has always been a great experience. However, this year, I purchased a new car and my first home. So, I was a little nervous about doing my own taxes and I wanted to make sure I received my first-time home buyer’s tax credit. So, I decided to go to Jackson Hewitt (which I thought would be completely professional) to have my taxes done. That was a big mistake. The gentleman that prepared our taxes for us went through the usual routine asking various questions and entering information on his computer for about an hour. Then, he said, "Well, I guess that's about it,” or something to that effect. During that whole time, he never asked about my home or mentioned anything about the home buyer's tax credit. So, I said, "What about the first-time home buyer's tax credit?” He then said, "Oh. Oh yeah." He then proceeded to ask another employee there how they do the first time home buyer tax credit. The lady he asked came over to us and stated that they don't have the proper form to do that yet. My wife asked her if none of the tax preparation offices have it, or it's just them. The employee of Jackson Hewitt then said, "No, it's like that for everyone.” The personnel there said we should go ahead and file, and we could do an amended tax return later free of charge. And, it would be no problem. Later that day, we looked on the IRS website at home and found the new form for the first-time home buyer program for 2009. We called Jackson Hewitt and informed them that we found the form and asked if we could come back and have our return fixed. They said, "No, it's our software. We have to get the update from our corporate office. You know how it is working for a corporation." And then the lady on the line gave a slight chuckle. I did not find this amusing. I feel like we were lied to because if we would have known the truth, we could have gone elsewhere and received our entire return by now. I feel the employees there said what they had to say to keep us in that office and get their fees for preparing our taxes. Now, I have to wait at least until February 15th to file my amended return, and it cannot be e-filed. Needless to say, I will never be using Jackson Hewitt again as long as I live.
I have been a customer with Jackson Hewitt for 19 years and like all of you I go there to receive the instant refund. And like all of you, I have always received it within 24 hours. I found out, I was denied as well as the rest of you. I could not believe it and when I call to find out what is going on. The lady told me that a lot of people were mad this year because they did get it. I filed a complaint to their state Franchise office, their Corporate office and to Steven **, the General counsel with Jackson Hewitt. I also sent him a long letter, including this link of all the letter and which I am sure my complaint wasn't the first, now that I found this site. I have gotten on my Facebook, I am getting on Twitter, and I am going to create a YouTube of my experience, and until they fix this problem. We can not allow for big business, and banks to continue to take advantage of us. Everyone that is on the complaint blog. Get the word out on your Facebook and to everyone on your Facebook and ask them to spread your experience in Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and I am contacting CNN. Contact CNN. Contact your local news. No more being taken advantage off. It is over. We are tired. You are tired of being on the losing end. If we wanted to wait 8 to 14 days, we would have did Turbo Tax or did it through the IRS ourselves.
Victoria, a tax preparer for Jackson Hewitt failed to disclose relevant information about our RALs this year. River City Bank which is handling Jackson Hewitt's RALs this year in several states sent memos out around January 8, stating that anyone claiming dependents, which were not of birth, such as grandchildren, nieces, nephews, foster children, etc would not be accepted for an RAL and would only be able to qualify for the up to 2 week wait. We are senior grandparents who are raising 2 grandchildren and have not had a problem with RALs in over 5 years until this year. Now, we are waiting 14 days, and were forced to pay $365 for a service that is offered for free by the IRS, and $50-$75 by other preparers in the state. We called the IRS and they said nothing is wrong with the tax and it is going fine but it was filed with them as a RAL. What's wrong with this picture? River City Bank together with Hewitt Jackson knew from the very beginning they were not going to give many RALs this year and were very discriminating who they would give them to. They both failed to disclose this information to their customers, in hopes of collecting the higher rates which is going to profit them in the millions of dollars this year. This is a very sad situation of malicious intent for profit directed at American's poor, senior, and disabled population. At the very least, this should warrant a class action suit and should also include imprisonment in the states which laws have been broken and provides such remedies for the poor, senior and disabled. Do a Yahoo Search "River City bank Rals in 4 states scary situation" you will note that various stock and banks are also aware of this situation and just sitting back and watching.

After waiting an hour to get my taxes prepared, I went to the desk of where Andy was working. He was at Wal-Mart in Spring Hill, FL. After I waited my turn, this one guy butted in front of me and started asking Andy questions. Instead of telling him he needed to wait his turn like I had, Andy just ignored me and answered his questions. Next, there was another couple there who tried to butt in. This lady said she had an appointment. Andy did tell her that they don't make appointments so she couldn't have. She then said, "Well I need to make some copies of this because I don't think I can stay." She felt very comfortable coming behind the desk and how to operate the copier, so I got the impression they knew each other. After Andy finally gave me his attention, he asked how he could help. I told him I was afraid it was going to be a little complicated because I had 4 different states. He immediately stated finding excuses and told me I should go to another store. I said, "You've got to be kidding me. I've been waiting for 45 minutes and now you're telling me you don't want to do my taxes?" He said he could do them but didn't think he could do as good a job as another store. If he can't do complicated taxes, he shouldn't be there. The friend of the lady whom he was doing taxes before me was from New York, so she had 2 states. After I got up and walked away, I went back to get his name and sure enough, the couple that I think he knew was sitting there. I honestly feel he blew me off to help them. Or, he actually isn't qualified to do a decent job.
First of all, I am single mother of three. I work in Real Estate/Property Management. I have used Jackson Hewitt to file my taxes for 5/6 years. 2006 was a very high stress year for me. I filed my 2006 return with JH and needed the money ASAP. I was able to pay my back mortgage for a few months and get out of the weeds, only to go back down in a hole. In late 2007, I lost my home and my children and I became homeless. As I went by my old home to check my mail, I had received a letter from the IRS saying there was a mistake in the amount of $1800.00 on my 2006 return. I immediately contacted the IRS and explained to them that I had JH prepare my return and I was lost! I went back to JH and they asked me if I bought the gold guarantee. I assumed, as most individuals, that if I pay for a service and they make a mistake, that they would be responsible to fix it! Wrong! The story gets better. I went back to them in 2008 for an electronic filing of my current return and an amended 2006 return (which I had to pay for, yes, I had to write them a check for $128.00, check no. ** to fix their mistake) to amend the 2006 return and electronically file the current year. (I bought the gold guarantee) I only went back to them because they were familiar with this mess. I have spoken to a guy named Ambrose. He assured me throughout 2007, he was aware of my situation and was going to fix it! He was mumbling form letters and numbers that had to be filed with the IRS. Apparently, this never happened. Hence, the amended return I had to pay for and they were to send in, and it could not be filed electronically. So I paid, wrote that check, their mistake they promised to fix. And guess what happened? They forgot to send in the amended return! I am thinking it got filed and someone screwed me again. I have called and called and made a case number with the corporate office. I have had one call in 3 weeks from guess who? Ambrose, the boss of the North Point Branch who has told me more stories than the Bible, and now he is having his staff lie to me when I call. How hard can this be? Seriously, how hard can this be? So as I of now, I am assuming I owe the IRS $1800.00 + interest for 3 years all because of a mistake this company made and that I have paid for many times over. I need help! I am working in this terrible economy and I am terrified my rent check will bounce because of the IRS seizing my money. How can they do this to customers and not even give me the respect of a call back or an update. I am sorry, a truthful update. Has anyone else experience this?
I stopped at Walmart on my way from work to buy groceries. I walk into the store and see the Jackson Hewitt booth and decided to stop and have them prepare my tax return since I had my tax information with me because I was going to do my own taxes at work but just did not have time. I walked to the booth; there is a woman on the phone (I come to find out a personal call). She looked at me and said, "I am talking to my niece." I kind of whispered at her, "I need to do my taxes." She looked at me, never hung up the phone, and handed me a sheet of paper and told me, "Fill this out," which I did (she was still on the phone). Finally, she hung up and told me again, "Oh, that was my niece." First thing she told me, "You know, your husband needs to be here to sign." I said, “Can we do the paperwork and he can come by tomorrow to sign, or can I take it to him to sign?” She then said very aggressively, "No, I said he needs to be here." At that point, hearing her tone of voice, I knew that this would be a bad experience. I said, “Okay, thank you,” and told her that I would prepare the taxes myself, or go to H&R Block, which I have had good experience with them. She then handed me the sheet of paper with all my personal information back. I stood up and asked her for her name. She gave me her first name then she said, “And what is your name?" Again, she was very aggressive. I said, “You do not need my name.” At this point, she stood up, grabbed the sheet of paper from my hands, and tore it three different pieces including the top, which had my name on it. I tried to grab the paper back from her, but by looking at her behavior, I let go. She again very aggressively grabbed the phone and said, "Here, do you want to talk to my supervisor?" I said no and that I would call her tomorrow and left in tears and feeling threatened by her conduct. She absolutely had no customer service skills. She was very unprofessional and rude. On my way out, I spoke to the Walmart Manager and explained to him the situation. He gave me the business card for the main number to Jackson Hewitt to report the incident. Overall, again, I felt threatened by her behavior.
Last year, I went to Jackson Hewitt on (January 22nd) to file my taxes. I asked for the ral because me and my wife's first anniversary was on (Feb,14th) her birthday is (Feb. 23rd) and mine is March 20th. I didn't receive my tax refund until March 26, 2009. I thought it was held up because the IRS was reviewing it to verify my info, so I went back this year on Jan. 26, 2010. I asked for the ral, I was told that since I'm not a first time customer that it wouldn't be a problem. The next day comes and they keep acting like they are too busy to talk, but telling me that they have a pile of checks just haven't had the time to look at them yet and I should be receiving a call soon. Hours go by, so I call again, I wasn't approved for the ral, but I should have a check on the 5th or the 12th. I forgot to mention they couldn't print my paperwork, the computer wouldn't let me sign, so they tell me to leave I can. They charged me the exact same amount for the 8-15 day as they did for the ral. If that ain't hustling what do you call that. It is cool to hustle as long as you are not ripping people off. Give them what you offered before you received their money. Never again.
I filed my taxes on Monday, February 1, 2010. I was told that my taxes would have to actually be filed to get my fees. I was also told that I had the option to receive my money next day. I have yet to see my money. I also realized that my total fees ended up being 600+. Now call me crazy, but that should be tax gouging.
I also have filed with Jackson Hewitt for 3 (three) years, and all the while I’ve been with them, there are tax problems. Every year there's a different problem that always fall back on me. I carry the same dependents every year, but somehow I can't carry them because they have to be living with me at the end of the tax year, but they live with me at the beginning of the year. She’s disrespectful, she’s loud, and she talked my business open in front of everyone that was in the room. Before it was my turn, you couldn't here anything the other person was saying and that I have to go back to Jackson Hewitt because of the loan and fees.
I was told on the phone that to prepare my taxes, it would be around $60.00 because I only had two W2s and I am claiming the head of household with 4 dependents. It sounded easy, right? Well, when I got there and had her do a RAL because I needed the money right away, I was charged over $500.00 for her to prepare my "simple" return. The fees for Jackson Hewitt were around $423.00 with a $100.00 RAL bank fee. I did get my money within 48 hours. But now I am asking myself, was it worth it? These people play on the down and desperate and it really needs to stop. Next year, I am going to file my own ** return and wait the 8 days. It beats spending over $500.00 (a car payment) to JH. Scammers!
Here is how my Jackson Hewitt visit has been this year which I will share with every person I come in contact with. On January 28, I went to the location in Walmart. I waited 20 minutes for them to tell me that they are doing software updates and were out of ink. I went home and came back two hours later. I waited about 45 minutes. It was no problem. I expected that Dale completed my taxes and was very nice. This was on a Thursday. I did the RAL direct deposit. Dale put the wrong account number on for my bank so therefore it was rejected. Not only did they do this once but twice, then they tell me that it will bounce back and print a check. Well, tomorrow will be 6 days and I still don't have my refund and I paid over $400 to them to have this done! They keep telling me "let me get your number and give you a call back " and then they don't. I had one call back from a lady named Karen in the Greenville office. I will never use them again and I will tell every single person about my visit with Jackson Hewitt! Oh, also I called the 800 number to the corporate office and they told me that there was nothing they could do about it. And I am sure that typing this up will do me no good either but there you go.
I had my tax return done through Jackson Hewitt on 1/14/10. I was told they were not doing Rapid Refund this year. Not a big deal, wait the 2 weeks. The IRS "Where’s my refund" website said my tax refund was directly deposited on 1/29/10. However, no money was placed on the "power" card. I figure the deposit need time to clear, so I wait until Tuesday, 2/2/10, then I check again, nothing. I start flipping through the paperwork that Jackson Hewitt provided to me on the day I'd done the return and noticed a phone number for the bank Jackson Hewitt is currently using (Republic Bank). I call the 800 number provided, which is a tax return info line, as it turns out. I entered my info and the automated teller at the other end tells me, "We have received your refund, but are unable to process at this time. Contact your tax preparer for further details." Well, I did that, to little avail. Then I decided to try calling Republic Bank on my own. While I was waiting for Republic Bank to call back, I got through to someone there, who informed me that JH had never sent the application and that they had our tax refund, just nowhere to send it. I called JH to inform them of this problem and I hear, "Well, I've got to call corporate HQ, I’ll call you back." This was hours ago and I believe I'm going to be trying to fix this problem with very little support from JH. For an impatient person like myself, who pay some regular Joe $200-300 to do our taxes, maybe we can all learn from this and do our own taxes from now on. The consequences resulting from this our own doing, however, the tax service cost $300 and I could've gotten my taxes back faster by e-filing myself.
I was charged $250 and a $41 fee for a simple electronic file that could have been done for free or a very small charge elsewhere. I was told this was a refund "loan" but later found out that it was not paid to me until after the taxes were filed and refunded by the IRS. How is that a loan? This is a rip off!
I filed my taxes with Jackson Hewitt for the first time, mind you, on January 18. I was told at the end of the tax preparation, even though I clearly stated I would like a refund the next day, that they no longer offer the next-day loan but I will get a cashier's check within 8 to 15 days, which was acceptable to me. Once we were finished, I was told that my tax preparation fee was $488.00 plus bank fees extra; therefore, my fee to them would be over $500.00. I filed head of household, 2 children, and Earned Income Credit. Never, and I mean, never before have my taxes cost me over $100.00 to prepare. I went to Jackson Hewitt, because they were recommended to me for a quick refund. Anyway, after informing this lady that I am not paying over $500.00 to file my taxes, she got on the phone with "corporate," and they came down in their price to $175.00 plus bank fees totaling $236.00. Big difference! So, still thinking this was high, I agreed, because she wanted $50.00 if I decided not to finish, which I did not have. On January 22, I checked the IRS website and was notified that the funds are scheduled to be direct deposited on January 26. On January 27, I called Jackson Hewitt and told them that I have information from the IRS that the money was direct deposited into their account yesterday, January 26. I was told they haven't heard from the bank yet, but yes, a check should be ready to be picked up tomorrow. I never received a call back, so I called again on Friday. I gave them a whole day to get the check. I called on Friday, and I'm told that the "manager" has been working very hard onto getting my check and that it was supposed to be here this morning but it still did not come in. Now, to my knowledge, at that time, my refund has been sitting in their bank since Tuesday and no one seems to know why I haven't gotten a check. I was told that the manager will call me back before 2:00 pm. At 4:00 pm, I called back, and after giving all my information again, I was put on hold, and after about 10 minutes, she got back on the phone and told me that "he has been very busy but he is going to call me right back." At 7:00 pm, I received a phone call from the "manager." I would call him by his name, but I cannot pronounce it. He had a very thick accent that was hard to understand. At any rate, I am told by this person that there has been a huge "technical" mistake and my money was sent back to the IRS because they (Jackson Hewitt) had no record of it. Therefore, they sent the refund back to the IRS, and I should be getting a paper check by the IRS on February 5, which seems to be the blanket date they are giving everybody. I told him that it was not acceptable to me, and I want the check that was promised to me and I want it tomorrow. He told me there is no way he is going to cut me a check when they don't have the money to cover it. I told him in a very matter-of-fact tone that I want something done and I want it done tomorrow. It was their mistake and I want it corrected. He said, "I will call corporate and see if there is anything we can do. I will call you back in an hour." After not hearing from him the whole rest of the evening, I called back at 10:00 am (opening time) and was told he would not be in until noon. I called at 12:15 pm, asked for the manager, and was told he wasn't in. I said I would call in 30 minutes. I waited 2 hours and called back and got another person on the phone that I have to explain the whole situation again with all my information, just to be told that I would get a check that would be released from the IRS on February 5. After several attempts to try to get them to correct their mistake, I decided to wait until Monday, today, to call the IRS, since you have to wait 5 days after the direct deposit date to call. I got the IRS on the phone, after waiting 32 minutes, and I was told that the funds were actually deposited on January 19. The date that the IRS gives on their website is always about 8 days later, then it is actually deposited according to them. I said, "So Jackson Hewitt has had my refund since January 19, correct?" The reply was "Yes." I asked the very nice lady at the IRS (truly she was very helpful) if they have any record of Jackson Hewitt sending it back to them and that they (the IRS) is cutting me a check on February 5. She replied, "We have not received the money back, which is very uncommon. And even if we had, it will take up to 3 to 4 weeks for a paper check." She has absolutely no idea how Jackson Hewitt would know a date that they would be sending a check. Plus, my refund which Jackson Hewitt has had for almost 2 weeks now has not been returned. I call the JH branch back and told them all the information that was given to me by the IRS, and they just couldn't believe that the IRS told me they have "no record of cutting me a check on February 5, because that is what her notes say." I asked her who at the IRS told her that, and she had no idea and that it just says that in the "notes." I explained again, very nicely, that I will not wait any longer for my refund that clearly has been either sitting in their bank or spent by them. This is a $2000.00 refund that I was expecting on Friday, with which I had plans to leave for the weekend with my children, and with which I had promised to pay a debt off that day. Now, I have to tell my children we weren't going anywhere and look like a complete liar to the individual that I owe money for a loan. I was told by the lady at JH that she would look into what is going on with my refund and will get back to me. I, of course, told her that I have heard that over and over again. She said, "I can't make any promises, but I will look into it." I asked for a corporate number and was given the 1-800 number. I called them and asked for the direct number to corporate and was told that I have to have an extension in order to speak to someone at corporate. I asked for a list of extensions and I was told it was "classified." I cannot get a hold of anyone to give me my money that Jackson Hewitt clearly has and has had for several days. This is not a loan; it is my full refund, and they are sitting on it! I do not know where to go from here. I am afraid I will have to wait at least another 30 days to receive it, if I do at all! This service needs to be stopped immediately for conducting service. I have only started with the complaints. My next step is a lawyer, so now my refund is going to cost me an arm and a leg. Way to treat the general population that is just trying to get by with what we have, Jackson Hewitt. Very corporate of you!
I filed my taxes with Jackson Hewitt on 01/28/2010. I wanted a Refund Anticipation Loan. I was told there would be no problem and I would have the loan in 24 - 72 hours. Later that evening, a supervisor called verifying my information. I answered her questions. I have filed my taxes for over 20 years with no problem except for 2007 when I also used Jackson Hewitt. I called Jackson Hewitt on 02/01/2010 and was told via 1-888-299-1040 number that I did not qualify for the RAL. I'm okay with that but once they knew, I should have been called and offered other options, namely to take my taxes somewhere else. I could have filed online with the IRS and not have had any fees or I could have filed using Turbo Tax and gotten a direct deposit for less than 50%. Now I may get my refund 2/12 or 2/19 according to Jackson Hewitt. I have filed a complaint with my Secretary of State and will be filing a complaint with the IRS. I am experiencing some economic hardships this year which I have not had in past years and really was counting on this refund to get me over the hump.
Jackson Hewitt lied to me about getting taxes back in 1-3 days. Not to even think about how much they charged me. Thank God I have common sense to have a savings account to fall back on! JH will reap what they sow!
Now I feel a little better, yet pissed at the same time. So, what you all are saying is that they are outright stealing our money? Telling us we can get our money in 24 hours and then making us wait? While knowing all along that they are no longer processing RAL's and still charging the same amount as if we received it in 24 hours? What??? So, what can we do to stop them from taking advantage of people living in a recession. I mean really, obviously we need the money or we would just wait however long it takes to receive our refunds. This has to be illegal. Being a single mother that actually works and doesn't sit at home living of the government, I need the money to pay rent, power bill, and purchase a car so that I can continue to work. I was depending on my refund so that I can get my bills caught up and take care of my children.
I was getting my taxes prepared and the gentleman preparing my taxes told me they base the fees they charged on how much money I gross. I told him it should be based on the tax forms used not how much money I make. Then he made me sign a fee waiver so if I didn't like how much my fees were in the end, I would still have to pay Jackson Hewitt $69.00. I signed the form because I had no idea my fees would be $724.00. After seeing how much my fees were, I asked him why the fees were so high. I told him last year my fees were $524 for a simple 1040, how come the fees are always changing each year. That's when he told me that the fees are based on my gross income and some of the fees go to the tax preparer and the manager as commission. I told him that I wasn't going to pay him $724.00 or the $69.00. I told him this was a scam and I was going to seek legal counsel to get to the bottom of this. That's when another tax preparer came to his desk and asked me how much money would I feel comfortable paying. I told her she should be charging me a set price e.g. short form 1040, etc. The manager came over to the desk at that time and asked me if I wanted to leave and I said yes and she told him to give me my W2's and told me I could leave. I want to have Jackson Hewitt audit for the 10 years prior for each year they prepared my taxes because I think they're scamming their customers out of money. Their charging consumers based on how much money their gross income is instead of charging base on the tax forms used. My charges was $724.00 for a short 1040A . I refused to pay. I will go back to Jackson Hewitt on February 1, 2010 to get the name of the gentleman that worked with me.
I went into Jackson Hewitt to file my return. I had received a coupon that said "I qualify for the $2,000 credit line in which I could receive the next day.” So when I asked the preparer he told me yes, so he proceeded to prepare my taxes. He informed me of the amount that I am getting back and never asked me anything about the $2,000 credit line. So he said the computer did not give him any other options so he called a supervisor and they told him I didn't qualify, but he had never applied for the credit line for me in the first place. Then the supervisor told him to do a rinse on his system and try it again. Still no option, he apologized and told me the soonest I can get my taxes will be 8 to 15 days, and because of the economic situation they are not really offering the RAL and told me I should have my taxes by February 5 2010. Well, I went on the IRS website and was told I should receive it by February 9, 2010. I called Matthew and he pretty much laughed and said, "Well, everybody else has been getting their return in the 8 to 15 days and mine is well over that timeframe.” He said, “Maybe it's because you are getting such a large amount that they want to look at it more.” But my complaint is they need to be consistent. I've been with Jackson Hewitt for 7 years and never have I had a problem with them until now. He told me that he will refund me $44.00 if I don't get my taxes on February 5, 2010. That doesn't make everything okay.
A new girl, who never did taxes before, told me and my friend that we had to file married filing joint this year as we live in the same house. She said it was a new tax law. If you live together for 6 months, you had to file this way. I always get rapid refund next day. I was approved when we left the office but suddenly got a call the next day that I was declined by the bank. I would have check in 8 to 15 days but still being charged $386 for my taxes. They have my state refund but I still have no check from them. I think the government should investigate Jackson Hewitt for fraud because they are advertising a product they won't do and taking a large chunk of refund money from people who could have filed online for free to wait 8 to 15 days for a check. I am getting evicted because my rent is past due. I have three kids and nowhere to go. My car payment is past due and they are trying to repossess it. I think we should all file a class action suit against Jackson Hewitt and their new bank that are ripping people off and stealing money for a product they won't deliver.
Don't believe you will get money any faster than filling online for free! I too fell victim of the scam for such an extreme need to pay my bills and buy groceries for my family! I am out about $500 and was given $1150 on an ipower card 3 weeks ago through MetaBank. Now I did not meet The Republic Bank's underwriting loan criteria and will be waiting at least 14 days until the bank receives my money from the IRS, so I can be charged a finance fee before I even get my money. I would like to see how Jackson Hewitt can get away with doing this to so many people! I am 30 days behind in some bill. I am one of six people working in my home. I made payment arrangement with these places to keep my lights on, my cable on and my phone on; and I have no money to feed my family! I would have been better off filing for free online!
I shopped at Wal-Mart this day and Vivian stopped me and said had I filed my taxes yet. I replied no and she said she was highly qualified to get me the highest tax return by the next day. I returned two hours later she said all I needed was all dependent’s SS number and my ID. She said that after she’s done with my taxes I will have my check by the next day no later than 10 or 11 a.m. No questions asked. I ask her if I could have direct deposit into my checking account for my federal, she replied no only my state and that will only take 3-5 business days. I told her I’ve never had any problems with my taxes and I always got my refund by direct deposit or the next day. She said we will not have any issues. She first quoted me a low return and she realized she forgot to add my dependents. After placing all the correct information into her system, she said she lost my whole file. She had to call a supervisor from another store to help locate my file. After he located my file, the problem is that she still was unable to print my file. She asked me if I wanted the Gold guarantee package and at that time I declined. After waiting an additional hour to clear her mistakes, I asked her is there anything else I needed or anything else she needed from me. She replied no and she apologized for the errors and she'll see me tomorrow and then she'll give me all printed copies and my refund. I reminded her of my $25.00 coupon. She said she has applied it already. The next day I called Vivian and she said I was declined. I said what? She said because of the recession most everyone, no matter who does their tax returns, is being declined. I replied you never disclosed to me that there was a chance I couldn’t get my return or I wouldn’t have taken a chance with you. She said I think the bank we go through does a credit check. I ask why didn’t you disclose this information. She said I should have my return by the following Friday. Oh, I was so upset. I told her that I have so many things due from my car note, a place to live (I applied for an apartment that is waiting for there deposit and first month rent), bills, my daughter has a busted ear drum that she need more medication, etc. I drove to Wal-Mart to get all my paper work (tax preparations) and asked if I can take my taxes to someone else and she said no or I will be audited. I asked for her to adjust my taxes for the bank fees for the loan and to add the Gold package because there has been too many things had gone wrong. She replied ok. She said I didn’t have to go over my paper work and I didn’t have to sign because the day before I signed there’s electronic key pad. The final straw: I receive a letter from the IRS stating that there is an error in my return of $233.00. She finally printed my documents that are failed and not readable said HR printer ink is not working right. I live in a motel with a friend because I couldn’t pay my share of the rent. I couldn’t move in to the apartment I qualified for because of this hardship. I had my auto loan company to a post date payment for 01/28/10 for my 2 months past due payment. I had to go to a local shelter for food for myself and my family. It has been a domino affect. One thing after another.
I filed my taxes with Jackson last Saturday. I have a simple tax filing, just my W2 information and claims to two children/child tax credit. I am in Las Vegas Nevada and I have used Jackson for 4 years with no issues and always got my loan the next day. I was told that Jackson is no longer using the iPower card this year (as I see a couple people who posted were not told this obviously) and they were not doing the one hour loan. I was told that they are still doing the RAL, which is the next day loan. I was charged $417 for the preparation fees which did not include bank fees. Sunday comes and goes and after a call and a walk-in, my check is not there. I asked what was going on. I was told by the tax preparer that it shows approved in the system but he does not know if that means approved by the bank for the loan or approved by the IRS. Okay, so I called on Monday. No check. By now, I am angry, telling him that I could have gone anywhere or done this myself for maybe like $30 if I was going to wait this long. I complained that I wanted some of my money refunded because the service was not delivered to me. He said to me "Jackson charges $417 whether you get a paper check in two weeks or you do a RAL". I argued, this is not true. If that was true, everyone would get the next day service. He continued to say "yes, this is true". I called the corporate office to make a complaint twice and got disconnected twice! Then I called another office to verify the fees. I was told no, the preparer was incorrect. We should not be charged if we do not receive the RAL. So she said my fees were not down to $386 and that I would get a separate check for the difference to correct the problem. In the morning, I had called the bank that Jackson uses, which is a bank in Kentucky called River City Bank. This is a new bank they started using this year. They told me that my return came over electronic and as a paper check to be delivered in two weeks! I called the IRS and they also confirmed. When I called the preparer later in the afternoon, after he spoke with the bank, he flat lied to me and told me that my RAL was declined when in fact it never came over as an RAL but a paper check. Supposedly because of all my phone calls and complaints all over the place, I will be refunded some of the prep fees (about $140), which I am still trying to either get that money or get something in writing. After all this, I will never use Jackson again. Next year, I will file my own taxes on the IRS website and just do direct deposit. Please continue to complain to every source you have and make sure you get a refund for some of your fees for not receiving your RAL. I, too, was anticipating the loan the next day because of the economic situation and the desperate need. This has had a high impact on my situation and not to mention, the stress of all the phone calls I have had to make.
I put my taxes on my ipower card last year with no problem. This year, I did the same, and I was told the next day that it would be 8 to 15 days before the money would be on my card. When I got my taxes out from last year, I realized I was getting charged the same amount from last year to get them overnight. But now, I have to wait almost two weeks. People are getting ripped off.
My husband and I used them last year. No problem, we waltz in there with all our papers in order and the guy acts like we are trying to fraud them because we take care of special needs for a family member and we have her information from social security. He sees this and says if we are actually taking care of her even though, we brought her with us as she is mentally disabled and has to be with us at all times. After this indignity, he does our taxes and tells us we are getting our RAL. Of course, we were denied. Then we go back the next day and confront them. They claim that they have a stack of checks, as if we are the only ones in Tampa not approved. We are scheduled to get our loan on Feb 5th or 9th. I could have filed myself for free. They charged us $400 out of a $2,400 repayment! We needed that money to catch up on bills. We were lied to and they knew full well Republic Bank is not approving loans. After further investigation, we learned last year they knew this year there would be no RALs. They say we will not be getting a refund for them and charging us for a RAL. Now, we have to wait on the IRS. I could have saved money and time by not using them. Why advertise a product that does not exist.
I went into this branch in Madison, TN, with my husband to file our tax return. We were greeted by an employee who seemed straight forward. We went through all the steps of filing the information needed. Once she told us what we would be getting, I asked if we could do a "same day" loan. She stated that Jackson Hewitt no longer gives same day loans. I said, "okay, what is the next step". She pointed on the chart to three different routes. I went with the RAL like I always have for six years. Now, need I say I was referred to Jackson Hewitt by a respectable friend. I was told I will receive the funds the next day. I called the 800 number I was given, but long before that, I looked at the papers the lady stapled for our records. The face sheet states, "thank you for choosing Jackson Hewitt Tax service. Your 2009 income tax return has been completed and filed electronically with the IRS in Philadelphia Processing Center, and if approved, you can expect your RAL in a little as one day". Now, this is after the taxes are filed. They are such liars. I will be at this branch protesting and stopping people from filing their taxes with this company. Something needs to be done about this. Like many others, I was told I have to wait 8-15 days with a $428 tag on the end of it. I hope this matter gets resolved. Further, I was trying to keep our lights from being turned off, tithing in church, and all sorts of things that I needing to pay for.
The purpose of going to a "professional" was due to buying home/renting old, Schedule C's, buying cars, etc. to make sure we were getting right refund, doing the taxes correctly. If it wasn't for the rental income, I would have done it online. We were quoted by the person answering the phone number online (which turned out not to be the local office like I asked) that it would be about $80. This was even after I told her of several forms we would be attaching. The gentleman was nice at first. When it came to the rentals that he did fairly quickly, he correctly asked the other owner about this but apparently did not get an answer right away as it wasn't until 1/2 hour later that she came in, unashamedly looking me dead in the eye and asking me if the IRS would believe that I had 3 legitimate Schedule C's! They are legit and she tried to make me look like dog ** in front of several other customers and employees in the office! They proceeded to tell me we could not use the rentals a rentals (explained well, but still with a note of "you are so **" whereas this is the part where my Master's Degree mind knows I should let her self-pride smack her in the face with someone else, but I am PO'd). This is where some comment was made about cost and I said "Wait a minute, what is this costing? Because if it is over a certain amount, I want to stop now". I was told not to worry, it won't be that much by the manager. Well, wrong! The $89 charge turned out to be $410! When my husband came in, we did take our things and leave, not paying them.
I have been using Jackson Hewitt for the last 7 years. I have always got my refund the next day but, of course this year, I did not. I called the bank that denied me. They stated that I would have to wait until the IRS deposit my return which they did last night. But, of course, I have not heard from Jackson Hewitt about my check that I am supposed to have but the IRS has funded the account. I will never use Jackson Hewitt next year.
Yes, I have been going to them for five years. I always thought that Jackson Hewitt was a good tax company. This year, they did get over on a lot of people just to put money in their pockets (they charge me $400.00 at first until I started complaining, then they took off a whole $50.00. I was told that it was a discount, but still I was charged $350.00. People do anything to make fast money We do need to put a stop to this. Next year, they would not get my money.
This concerns my experiences as a Jackson Hewitt customer on Tuesday, January 26th 2009. It was not a good experience. First, some explanation is in order. Like so many people right now, the phrase a rock & a hard place barely begins to describe the dire straits my family & I find ourselves in. An eviction notice was served on us resulting in being locked out of our home. I won't bore you with the rest of the details. Since Jackson Hewitt's heavily advertised next-day refund seemed to be our best way out of this predicament (a solution that I was highly reluctant to use for obvious reasons that we all know), we first went to the nearest location to our (used-to-be) home here in High Point NC. The young gentleman there (apparently a recent immigrant from somewhere, with an accent so heavy it was hard to understand) could hardly function without calling a supervisor first, wasting time over a question he should have already known the answer. Having no time to waste (locked out of our house, desperate, remember? ) we went to the next nearest Jackson Hewitt location. The office supervisor did a warm & competent job in preparing our taxes. We explained our emergency situation to her, & how important a next-day refund was to us due to our situation, as well as admitting that otherwise, I would've done the taxes myself. This is an important fact to bear in mind, & is at the core of my complaint with Jackson Hewitt's services. She was kind, patient, & knowledgeable in helping us navigate through what we needed to do. This makes what happened at the end of our transaction with Jackson Hewitt's services even more suspect. Remember, we had explained up front when we first sat down at the supervisor's desk how important & crucial a next day refund was to my entire now-homeless family. Moreover, this was explained to a woman with 30 years experience in tax preparation (by her own words) and undoubtedly several years experience within the Jackson Hewitt organization to have risen to the position of Office Supervisor. After the two hours of work to slog through our brief foray into retail business, then we find out that self-employment income disqualifies us for the one reason we were there in the first place. We were left feeling obligated since she had spent all this time with us. Meanwhile, she did or said nothing that would indicate our right to walk away since our chief goal (which we disclosed as soon as we sat down at her desk) was not met.This was inexcusable, & strikes me as a deceptive sales practice since our preparer knew what our situation was & through her vast tax-preparing experience with Jackson Hewitt, no doubt knew the next-day refund policy concerning self-employment income, but did not disclose it up front. This deception cost us $385.95 for a refund that we would've not gotten any sooner than if I had e-filed (via Turbo-Tax). That included charging us $49.95 to issue the check. In addition, I am forced to conclude that this is apparently company policy, not to disclose such important information first, since she was otherwise so extremely pleasant & helpful. In addition, blaming it on the bank that Jackson Hewitt runs these transactions through is not a valid excuse either, which was explained via previous paragraphs concerning the their experience. Due to these factors, I can only conclude that we were victims of deceptive sales policies set at Jackson-Hewitt's corporate level, that have much more in common with a shady used-car dealership than a nationwide tax-preparation firm. So, much like our experiences with Jackson Hewitt, here's what my policy will be concerning this matter: First & foremost, they have seen the first and last dime Jackson Hewitt will ever get from me or any member of my family. We were willing to put up with the exorbitant fees & interest of a next-day "refund" at rates that would make a loan shark salivate, as the price we had to pay to have a roof over our heads. We are not willing to do so under these fraudulent circumstances. Next, I will avail myself of every local media outlet with a consumer affairs division & send them a copy of this letter. I don't think I have to tell anyone that the fact that Jackson Hewitt advertises with these same media outlets will not shield them. Car dealerships tried that concerning disparaging articles about their sales practices that have appeared in newspapers & TV stations across the country, only to have that kind of finagling & advertiser "boycotting" struck down in several court cases concerning the rights of a free press. Next, we have the internet. I will be visiting as many consumer-protection sites as I possibly can to spread the word about how this all went down. Geometric progression will take care of the rest. I have written the company so they know that I'm dead serious about taking these steps, & they will not simply evaporate due to the struggles we're having.
I did my taxes on January 22nd, which was on a Friday, and I got an ipower card so I was told to check tomorrow. Well, I did and of course, the money was not on the card. I didn't check on it or even go back on Saturday. I waited until Sunday afternoon. I went to the office and asked if my name was on the list. The two ladies there said, "I don't know," and they checked and said that it was. When I had looked at the list, it was only one person on the list that was approved. The answer I got was, "I don't know, maybe check on Wednesday, that's when they drop checks." Of course, it was not there. My thing is that I have been with them for 10 years and have never been not approved. My credit is no different than before. It's not great, but usually, this time of the year is when I try to gets some things in order. They know people are going though difficult times, and a lot of people who are laid off, and are just barely making it. I have always trusted them even if I think that the charge is high, but you sometimes have to do what you have to do, to get by. I really believe that if they had a sign saying, "we are not giving out fast refunds," people would have filed some place else, or at least been given the option to go somewhere else. But instead, I guess a big company like that needed the money more than us. They should be ashamed. I did turbo tax for my son last year, and it was very easy, so I guess I'll try that for myself next year, and just wait. They are not getting my business again. I needed it for my bills, like everyone else, and I have a son who is in college who needs money for his books and other things. Also, I have two more children here, and another one who is going to attend college this year--and who should be sending out his application now. You know, at Christmas, you steal from Peter to pay Paul. But this year, I won't be able to pay Peter as I have in the past. He will have to wait a little more time. I just hope my stuff don't start getting cut off.
Like everyone else, I have the same complaint. I filed on the 1/22 and was told that my money would be on my card the following day. Which I believed, being I just had the holiday loan and didn't have any issues. The next day--no money. So, I called JH and was informed that I also was denied for the ral. How is that possible being I got one on 1/4. She had no answer. She stated that I would have it in 8-15 days. Now, I'm wondering is it 8-15 days after the IRS accepts. Because mines has been processing since Monday, when IRS states within 72 hours. What is really going on? I was told by another blogger that some have started filing complaints with BBB, in which I'm about to do. Because they knew that they was offering Ral's, but that was still advertising as if they were which is wrong. I'm an single mom and was looking forward to paying off bills. This has really set me back even further, being I made arrangement to pay off these bills when money was first expected.
Do not use Jackson Hewitt this year; it is a scam! There are no RAL loans, no one will be approved. The assisted refund will not get your money back faster. They are telling you eight to fifteen days, but that is actually when the IRS itself is posting it into your account. The assisted refund is actually a loan to cover the cost of paying your tax preparer and will make your basic file be over $300! Jackson Hewitt is actually not offering you a service that you can't do yourself, in the same amount of time, for no more than $30.00 tops. My fiancee filed on the 15th, same story as everyone else. He wanted the RAL but was told that he wasn't approved. They offered the assisted refund which he took, thinking that the IRS would take a month or longer. I explained to him that e-file this year would be really quick. He filed on the 15th and yes, the IRS has scheduled to release his direct deposit tomorrow, the 29th. So he paid $388.95 for a basic tax prep, which included 1 W2, the child tax credit paper work for three dependents, and a schedule M. His tax refund--which he would have gotten in the same amount of time, on the same day they said they would pay--will now go into their bank account, be deducted this outrageous fee, then deposited into his account. What exactly are we paying this for? I called the Jackson Hewitt rep tonight, and asked for a phone quote with exactly what he filed. I was told $99, his was $299 without the bank fees for the loan. Not two minutes later, this same preparer called him back about his complaint, and told him, "Well, I don't know who quoted her that, they were obviously mistaken." When I tried to call the number back, it wasn't even a Jackson Hewitt Office, it was the number to Western Container Transport and their message said that they were closed for the day. I don't know how they can legally do these practices. Nothing is explained up front until after you've completed the process. The fine print for the assisted loan says, "You can file your tax return electronically or by paper and obtain your refund directly from the IRS for free." The IRS can deposit your refund directly into your bank account in as little as 8 to 15 days from the time you file your tax return. The preparers are not telling you that if you paid your prep cost right away; it would be less than $100. I called H&R Block tonight also, and the girl was very clear that his taxes would not cost more than $60 for straight taxes without any RAL. This is ridiculous and needs to be addressed, what suckers are we not to read the fine print. Purposefully deceiving or not informing is the same as bold face lying to me. I hate you Jackson Hewitt, and I will definitely tell anyone and everyone not to use your service.
I been dealing with JH for about 11 years now, &and I always got RAL for $350.00. This year, they charged me $425.00, and told me I have to wait 8-15 days or longer. I do not feel it is right how they are treating people. I am taking care of my 3 grandchildren, and they are getting ready to shut my lights and gas off, because I planned on having my money to pay my bills. This will be the very last time I'll ever go to them again.
I have been using Jackson Hewitt for 12 yrs and this year I filed with them again. I was told that I qualify for the rapid refund that I always do, so I paid the $393 to file rapid. I have waited for 6 days now for that refund! In the mean time, I start finding out that Jackson Hewitt is working with a new bank this year and that bank is not approving anyone this year for instant or rapid refunds but they are still charging for these refunds! When I call to try to find out how long I will have to wait, I get the runaround and people have even been told the President is the one responsible for the refunds not coming in on time! How can this company get by with stealing money from customers they have had for so long? Is this the help we get from this country being in a recession? And what can I, and the rest of the consumers, do about this?
I went in on January 20, 2010 to have my taxes filed. I've been approved for the RAL for 3 years in a row. This year I applied for it and I got a call the next day that it had been declined. I asked why since I had been qualified in the past and of course the lady didn't have a clue why. She said I'd receive a letter in the mail stating why it was declined. It's been 1 week and 1 day but still no letter. She said it would take 8-15 days for my refund to be put on my iPower card. And you all know how high their fees are? Since the RAL was declined, the fee is only going down $30-$50. Are you kidding me? Their employees get paid hourly just like me so why in the world are the fees so expensive? Whose pocket is it going into? I've even tried going to the irs.gov website to check the status of my refund and keep getting the same message that they cannot give me any information on my refund. Even though the website says it takes up to 72 hours to get the information. So does that mean Jackson Hewitt still hasn't processed my taxes? I guarantee I won't be back next year!
Well, I have filed with Jackson Hewitt for several years and have always received my refund the next day. Well, not this year. 24 hours after filing my taxes, I still hadn't received any money so I called and they told me my RAL was denied. They couldn't tell me why. All they could do was give me their bank's number! All the bank could tell me was that they don't expect my refund until Feb. 5th! I filed my taxes on Jan. 25th expecting to get them back the next day like always so that I can catch up on my bills that I'm behind on, not to mention food or gas to get to work! I had to go to court to avoid being evicted from my home since I thought I was going to have my taxes to catch up the rent, but that didn't happen, did it? I stumbled on this website and was outraged to see that there were more stories of them ** people over. I thought it was just my bad luck. I will never use them again, ever!
Well, I guess I will tell the same old story here. I went to Jackson Hewitt here in Pittsburgh and got them something. I did my taxes on Tuesday night of 1/26/2010, the lady gave me a card, stated that I call that number at 9 am the following day to see if my check would be there. So, I called and I was declined. I then called her and asked her why and she stated that the bank will be sending me a letter in the mail. And then I came on here and started reading all the same horror stories. I proceeded to look into the bank that they use, Republic Bank. They have an 800 number for your tax information so I called. They asked for my SS number which I put in and my SS number was not on record with them. Well, how can that be if they declined my loan? So, then I called Michelle back up and advised her of this. She was flustered and she was like, “I have no comment.” What? No comment! Do you think you are talking to a reporter here? I am looking for my money. Well, she was like, “Give me your SS number.” And she was acting like she was putting it through the system and she was like, “Yeah, the IRS received your claim at such time and the bank rejected you on this time.” Oh really? Because when I called the number on the card at 8:00 am this morning, it stated that it was still being processed so how can you see that I was declined the night before. This is horrible. I tell you, I will never ever go to them again. I mean I can see if the bank is really rejecting you but I don't think the bank is even putting out claims through. We are all getting a standard recording telling us we are declined and we will be receiving a check in 8 to 15 days. Someone should really do something about this. They got us for all this money and I can't even take my business somewhere else. Now I am locked in. They should be closed down so this won't happen next year. I am in negative balance with my checking account and thought I would have that money to cover it but got scammed.
First, I went to have my taxes done and let Gregory file my taxes. At first, he explained to me that Jackson Hewitt would have to charge me $50.00 if he was to enter all the information. I decided not to let me do my taxes but they would still charge me that fee. That was okay. At the end of doing my taxes, I had asked to do a rapid refund and Gregory told me that President Obama had stopped rapid refunds for this year due to the banks and that I would not be able to rapid refund. I then called another tax place because all of my friends told me that they got rapid refunds and the other tax place told me that they are doing rapid refunds. I called another Jackson Hewitt company and they told me that Jackson Hewitt was the only one not doing this which they advertise on television that they do. So I called the administrative office in Mobile AL. When I first called, I told the person I talked to about my situation. She laughed and then hung up on me so I called back. She then put me on hold for 20 minutes. I hung up and I called back. She then put me on hold again. I hung up again, called back and I asked if she could leave my name and number and have a supervisor call me back but no one did. I called the office back and left a message for someone to call me back and they did not so I called back the next morning and left another message and no one called me back so then I called and spoke with another women and she said that she would leave the supervisor a message to call me but no one did. I feel that they should let everyone know that as they walk in the door, if they are doing rapid refunds, they need to go elsewhere, not lie and wait until the person finishes their taxes to tell them lie. I want something done about this situation because I would not have let Jackson Hewitt do my taxes if they would have been upfront. I feel that Jackson Hewitt should not only rapid refund my check but also not charge me anything to do so for all the inconvenience they have caused me I am a single mom and really could have used the money right away.
I filed my 2009 taxes with Jackson Hewitt on January 25, 2010 and I applied for the RAL and was told that I could pick up by check in 24 hours. Today is January 27, 2010 and when I called Jackson Hewitt to ask what is going on, they tell me that my RAL had been denied and that I would get the check in 8-15 days. So I ask the lady if anyone was going to call and tell me and she verified my telephone number and claimed that they should have called me and I continued to tell her that they didn't. That is bad customer service.
I am also a loyal customer of Jackson Hewitt for 19 years and like everyone else, I was deceived by them by not telling me about there is no more RAL loans until they told me my amount and said, oh, our fees have went down this year. And we still had to pay a loan fee. She said, “By the way, we don't do the one-day loan anymore. We can have the money deposited into your account, though.” Well, I was upset at that point. I feel that they should have told you as soon as you sat down with them, but no they don't. They wait till you say ok to your amount, and get all excited to have your money the next day. Then, wham--you have to wait for your money for 8-14 days. Wow, wow! Are you kidding me? Well, I am just like everyone else. I will not go back to Jackson Hewitt again. Oh, by the way, I was told the president of the United States made this change. This was told to me by the manager! Wow, really? Well, then how come HR BLOCK still does the same day, next day loan? They will never get any more of money ever! They lied straight to my face and if they do that, then I don't want them keeping my money! I will use TurboTax from now on--every year TurboTax will get my money! I’m upset by them lying to me and being so secretive in the whole situation. Even after I told her I needed to get money into the bank. I was so upset that my blood pressure went up and called my fiancé and told him what happened. He said calm down; just don't deal with them anymore.
I went to Jackson Hewitt on January 15th to file my taxes and was told they were not doing the RAL loan because Obama stopped it since it was too much money (Cape office). So I did the 8 to 15-day tax that cost me $320.00. I was then told I would receive it by the 27th on Wednesday; that is when the money goes on the ipower card. Today is my daughter’s 6th birthday and I am not happy. I still don't have my money and when I call nobody knows anything at all. I even had plans to take her to Disney World; now it’s all shot to hell. I could have gone directly to the IRS and had better outcome and saved $320.00. I want my money back from them because they are nothing but liars as I found out the banks that had dropped them since they went bankrupt. And they are looking for another bank, so everybody is suffering because of the deceit and lies. Now I get to tell my child that we can't go because the money I was waiting on isn’t going to come in and I still didn’t get an answer as to when either. I am about to contact my attorney and sue them. They could have been honest from the beginning but they weren't.
I went to the Jackson Hewitt in Cincinnati and was asked how long I wanted to wait. I asked if they do same day loan and he said no, but I can do the one day and the money would be on my card in one day. I left at 2:00 that afternoon, checked my card the next day, no refund. I called the Jackson Hewitt office. The guy that did my taxes answered the phone. I said, "Hi, I'm calling to talk to someone about my refund that was supposed to be on my i-power card." He said, "Is this Ms. **?". I was like yes how he knew it was me, I don't know. "Well, Ms. **, your RAL was denied", he stated. I said, "Why? I just was approved for the Christmas loan so how am I not approved for this?". He said he didn't know, that he would call me back with the bank number that denied me, which he never did. I called the bank and the automated system told me I wasn't approved because I didn't meet the criteria. I've been going through Jackson Hewitt for four years. I'm so disappointed and I don't recommend anyone to go there. They knew we weren't going to get our refunds in one day and instead of them being honest to their customers, they lied. I'm not happy at all. I was misled and feel they need to apologize to their customers. I called my local news and complained also. That's my money and I feel I work every year. I'm a tax payer, I don't delay them when I'm paying taxes to delay me when it's time for me to get mine.
We go in on the 23rd. We are the first person in the office. While we are filling out paperwork, others come in. So Kemper Sears looked at them, told us that she does not know how to file our claim and had to make a phone call, even though she is the owner and manager of this office. She's supposed to be responsible for training them. She only does part of the papers, had us wait to the side so that she can get to the others. She said that we are already approved for a Money Now and we should have our money in 1-4 hours. Four hours later, we have nothing so we go back in to tell her and she says it will be at least 12 hours before she can finish our paper work because “why should she be expected to file it so fast when it's tax season and she is obviously overworked." I asked her if that is keeping my rebate in hold and she says, "Of course not." At the end of the day, we still don't have it. She's called the bank, said it's on hold because of the IRS hasn't seen it yet. She told me it's the IRS's fault and that "her hands are tied." She does nothing else. I called the bank, iPower, Jackson Hewitt and the IRS and I learned that it's because she still hasn't transmitted the paperwork. I tell her this and it still takes her 3 days to complete the paperwork. She called us to come in and sign it and when we arrived, she isn't even there. So she can't transmit it. I go in after she arrived and confronted her about it and she went into histrionics saying I have expected too much from her because she is overworked and doesn't know what she is doing and had to make a phone call in Indiana, and how can I possibly expect her to actually do her job! I have been with Jackson Hewitt for over 15 years, my situation hasn't changed either. Yet she was trying to make out that my file was so unique, when all it was was that she was shuffling us to the side so that she could go to the next customer. I spent $504 just so that I could go through 5 days of ** with them. I still have not gotten my money, no one still knows anything, and I could have done this much myself. What a laugh? Is that at the end of this? One of the other employees gave me those crazy coupons and asked me to refer friends to them.
I believe all of our money is sitting in their bank, collecting interest and making more money off of us. All of us work very hard and at tax time we finally get to get caught up on our bills and treat ourselves to maybe a new outfit or I can buy that new TV. Well, this year my friends, it's gonna be a little longer. I did my taxes on the 15th and was supposed to get it on the 18th; then they tell me the 29th. Now it might be February 5--who knows when it will come? Just so mad. How can someone take advantage of people like this and sleep at night? Good luck everyone. I hope you all get your money before you get evicted or get your power and gas shut off.
I was told I could apply for loan and they knew they didn't have a bank. I had never been turned down for this loan before. I was depending on this money. It caused me to face a harder financial hardship. Based on a lie to get $400 in fees. This company should be put out of business or made to refund fee for misleading people.
Just like you all, I have been a loyal customer for seven years of Jackson Hewitt. I was told I was approved for the RAL. It wasn't deposited in my bank like I expected. I called and was told I was denied. I would have my money in 8-15 days. Still waiting. The fee was expensive. This is my last year as a loyal customer of Jackson Hewitt. They will eventually have to close down because people like us will not stand for fraud and dishonesty! I, like everyone else, has bills that are due. Bill collectors can only hold out for so long! Shame on Jackson Hewitt!
I filed my tax return on January 15, 2010 through my local Jackson Hewitt office as I have done for the past 10 years. I applied for a RAL loan which I have done for the past several years with Jackson Hewitt. I was promised that I could pick up my check on January 18 or 19. When I called to see if my check was ready, I was told that my loan had been denied and it would be 8 to 15 days before I would receive my refund. I have never been denied a RAL loan in the past and my credit score has improved since I was approved for my RAL loan last year. I believe Jackson Hewitt has been grossly negligent because of their "business as usual" treatment of this year's RAL loan customers. There is no way that my loan for this year should have been denied, given my improved credit score, unless a material change in the RAL loan program had occurred. I believe that Jackson Hewitt had a duty to inform their customers if material changes had been made to the RAL loan qualification requirements. Anybody up for a class action lawsuit? What really troubles me is the fact that my tax return is very simple and Jackson Hewitt told me that I still must pay the $272 tax return preparation fee. I have one form W-2 and earned income credit on my tax return. Even a moron like me could have electronically filed my return using TurboTax for less than $20. The date of receipt of my refund would have been identical to what Jackson Hewitt now is promising. The only reason I went to Jackson Hewitt was to get a one or two-day quick refund through their RAL loan program. Jackson Hewitt must not have done any due diligence when they changed their RAL bank lender or is intentionally failing to disclose the material changes in the RAL loan program to earn excessive fees from a multitude of loyal customers. I hope the executive management of Jackson Hewitt monitors websites like this one because they are in for a repeat of fines and/or judgments that occurred in 2007. Damages: The excess of $272 in fees over the amount required to electronically file my return using TurboTax.
On January 25th, I filed my taxes with Jackson Hewitt. I have filed either with Jackson Hewitt or H&R Block or Liberty every year. I have always been approved for RAL before. I was told by my tax preparer that it would be 1-2 days for my return and not to worry about being denied because 9 out of 10 people are approved and you will on be denied if you owe taxes, child support or student loans, which all three I do not owe or have ever owed. Well guess what? Just like all of you, I was denied and now I am being told it will be 8-10 days for my return. I wouldn't be so angry except I have never been turned down before and I was lied to directly by my tax preparer. Now I see how many other people are being ripped off and promised something they will not receive so Jackson Hewitt will still get your $400 to file your taxes knowing how many RALs are being denied and you will get your return no faster than if you eFiled with the IRS yourself for free. I will never go to Jackson Hewitt again and I hope everybody on here does the same.
I went to my Wal-Mart kiosk on Jan 8th and was told to come in on the 15th. They stated no one can prepare returns until then so 15th came and they had software issues. I came back everyday until the 18th, she took my w2 and didn't get it finished until the next day. I stated from day 1 that I just bought a car since mine was wrecked and needed that money for the down payment. I was use to having my taxes back by the 17th as past years with them. So I was told don't worry that it could be the next day that I get the money. Well, after 2 days of trying to call that office that has no phone, I was denied. Why? Bad credit it's a tax loan. That's why we pay so much. I was very mad. I told them if I couldn't be approved for the RAL, I needed to go somewhere else where I could get approved. Well, here it is the 26th, the dealer gave me until the 29th and as luck has it with this company, I'm sure they will take their time. Also, with my company discount, I get 25% off. They didn't give me that either. 3 years with them and because of this year's problems, I will never go back and hope my work doesn't allow them kiosk space anymore. They lie and lock you in. Once they file, they don't care. They just screwed us for $350. What a way to make money!
I originally went into the local office on Jan 15th to prepare my taxes. Once I got to the end, I was told to come back the next day to finish as they were having computer problems. I came back in Jan 16th and was told money now loans were not working but I could do RAL 1-3 days, so I agreed. Mind you, I've never been denied a RAL in the past. I was told my refund will be available Monday Jan 18th and they would call me when my check came in. Well, they never called me Monday and I called their 800 number to check my status and it stated I was denied a RAL and I would have my money in 8-15 days. Now, after doing research and knowing I wasn't the only one this happened to, I called Jackson Hewitt main office and was told that they are using a different bank this year and they are the ones who denied the loan. They also stated that the IRS isn't even depositing money to their bank until Jan 29th and I still may not even have my money then. I also mentioned the tax preparation fees and bank fees charged and the rep stated the bank will adjust the final amount but the Jackson Hewitt fees will stand and they will not refund anything. Now, this really set me off. How can a company promise something within a certain time and charge me for it in advance but not follow through and still charge me full price? I will never be going back to them ever again and will make sure everyone I know does the same.
I went in on January 15th to file my taxes and get a RAL. They told me 1-2 days. On Wednesday, I finally got a call saying my tax check was there. But it was for $2200 less than it was supposed to be. When they filed my tax return with the IRS, they deleted one of my daughters and only filed my return with one dependent. No one can/could explain to me how that happened or who did it even. I was told that they would file an amended return at no cost and I would have to mail it and receive the rest of my refund in 6-8 weeks! They then offered me 1/2 of my tax fees back, which I accepted (not received as of yet). The IRS was not accepting amended returns until today, Jan. 26th so my return isn't being completed until the end of the day. So it will be March before I get the rest of my refund. I have spoken with a district manager and told her I want all of my fees rebated and she is looking into the situation (she was never told anything about it, even though the office I use said she did). At this point, I am waiting to hear back from her. I will never use Jackson Hewitt again. They were entirely unprofessional and told out and out lies.
We had our taxes done yesterday at Jackson Hewitt, just as we have done for the past 7 years. We applied for a RAL, as we have always done. We were told that we would have our money most likely the next day and if for some off chance the RAL was not approved, it would be 5-7 days. So today, we got a phone call from Jackson Hewitt saying our RAL was denied. No reason other than our loan did not meet the bank underwriting criteria. Our situation hasn't changed much in the past 7 years and we have never had an issue getting our money within a day or two. So I called the bank. The bank gave me the runaround telling me they don't have any information as to why we were denied (obviously, someone had information or we wouldn't have been denied). Then she told me that they expect our refund to be available on Feb. 5th. What happened to 5-7 days? Now, we're on 8-15 days. So now they are charging me $320 for something I could have done myself for free. I want my money back. I am very unhappy and I will not be using Jackson Hewitt again. They just lost a very loyal customer.
I filed my taxes expecting a RAL. I was told my loan was approved. They called me a day later to say it was denied. I have been a customer for 10 years and never been denied. This is my last year filing with them. They charged me $423.00. If I knew I had to wait 8-15 days I would have did the e-file with IRS for free. They are a rip-off and should be made to refund all fees.
I too went there and they told me 1-3 days and then later on that day which was January the 20th, they called me and told me that my RAL was denied. I think that everybody that was told that lie should be paid back their fees. My bills are backed up because I too, like every one else that went there and got that big lie was depending on that money.
I went to Jackson Hewitt to have my taxes done, as I do every year. My choice to get the RAL was made due to my current circumstance. I was currently hurt on the job and taken out of work due to my injury. I first noticed that the fees were higher than last year for RAL. When I asked why, they told me it was because they are now dealing with another bank because Santa Barbara bank went bankrupt. I was also told I would have my taxes in one day. They did call me the next day to pick up my paperwork. I read through everything and noticed my check was not for the full amount of my refund. I immediately questioned it and was given excuse after excuse as to why it wasn't for the full amount. They ultimately told me that I only qualified for a certain amount through the bank and that I would have to wait two weeks for the rest of my money. I was very upset at that point, because they never once told me that this could happen. I would have went to the federal building in my area and had them done for free and waited to get it all back at once. I opted to do the RAL, so I could get my money back all at once and asap. Being out of work, my bills have been piling up and I was trying to catch up. They never gave me the opportunity to make the choice to go elsewhere. I asked them why I only received a portion of my refund. They explained that that's all I qualified for through the bank. When i spoke to a representative at the bank, they told me that i qualified for the full amount of my refund. I don't know what they did with the rest of my refund. But I am yet to hear from them. I payed almost $300 to have my refund back in one day. I have only received a portion. I don't feel I should have been charged all that money and still have to wait.
On Jan. 16, 2010, I went to Jackson Hewitt in Midway, GA and had the impression that I would be get my refund back the same day or on Monday the 18th. When they were done, they told me that I was denied for the RAL and was confused so I look into to it and they lied big time. It was because they did not have a bank until Jan. 5, 2010 and the bank did not meet federal guidelines. They charged me for a bank possessing fee and $200.00 for a fee to prepare my taxes, when it could have been for free to do them myself and wait just as long. This was [a lie]. The economy is so bad and people are depending on this to make ends meet. Jackson Hewitt needs to return the money for charging us to file our taxes and the bank fee needs to be refunded as well.
Jackson Hewitt had me thinking I would get my money within one day and now, they are saying 8-15 days. When I called in, it won't even give me any information. I couldn't pay bills and I got real behind in my bills.
I, too, applied for a RAL. I have never been denied the loan. I never was told they were not doing RAL this year. While I was waiting to get my taxes prepared, there was one lady that was sitting across from me with this very impatient look on her face. Once they called her name, she stated that she was there to pick up her check. A lady went to the back to check and told her it had not come in yet. The woman just stood there in silence for a moment and shook her head. She turned and walk out very upset. At the moment, it didn't click with me. But today, I understand and share that woman's frustration. I, too, called the 1-800 number given to get the same results as you all. I complained to the BBB because I hate feeling helpless and taken advantage of. This has to be against the law in some way. As some of you stated, I do the RAL because the money is much needed. I am a single parent who is getting ready to face eviction.
Jackson Hewitt are liars! I went in on Jan 13th to do my taxes and they said I would have to come back in on the 15th to sign my paper work. Then they told me I would have to wait 8-15 days to get my money on my Ipower card. I asked why because last year it was on my card within an hour. He told me everyone was doing this. My co-worker went to H&R Block on the 15th, got her money on her emerald card on Monday the 18th. So he boldly lied to me to my face. I will never go to them again. That's another customer lost. I will only use H&R Block. Oh yeah, it has now been 10 days and what a surprise, still no money. Why can't they be honest and tell their customers upfront that they had to get a new bank and that they didn't have a bank until Jan 5th.
Well on Jan. 15th, I went to Jackson Hewitt and had my taxes prepared. Upon leaving, I was told that I would be receiving my money in 1 to 5 business days having been approved for the RAL. On the 5th day, I received a call informing me I was denied for the RAL and would receive my money in 8 to 15 days. Now, it gets worse. The paperwork I received from Jackson Hewitt included a number to check the status of your refund, which is 1-800-829-4477. When I call the said number, the IRS informs me they haven't received my refund. I just checked again and it is Jan. 24th, same response. This made me call Jackson Hewitt back and now they told me they have no idea why the IRS is saying that because the IRS received, processed and released my refund to the bank and the bank will give it to me on Jan. 29th. So now I don't know what to believe, the IRS or Jackson Hewitt. But what I don't understand is if Jackson Hewitt bank received my money, then why must I still wait 6 more days for my money?
I will never go to Jackson Hewitt again. I have been going to them for the last 5 years. I think it was very wrong of them to lie to everybody about the RAL loans! Now, they have lost a lot of loyal customers and I think they deserve it! I have bills and rent to pay that will be late because I was expecting an RAL loan that they aren't even doing this year.
My husband never gets his W-2's until the last minute. I checked on Jackson Hewitt's website yesterday 1/22/10 and it said they would be able to pull my husbands W-2 up online. So myself and my husband went to our Jackson Hewitt and had our taxes done. We did want the 1-day check being that we have so many bills piling up from Christmas time. We left the office with a $400.00 bill for them doing our taxes. The man gave us a toll free number to call and check. I checked on our RAL this morning and it stated they submitted our return to the IRS and waiting on them to accept it. My husband then called Jackson Hewitt to ask about our RAL and they told him we were declined. Upon wondering why I located the Santa Barbara Trust Company, who our Jackson Hewitt uses for RALs, and the lady told my husband that they are declining everyone's this year because they are no longer doing the 1-day RAL anymore. She informed us it will be 8-15 days to get our return. I am sure that Jackson Hewitt knew this and I think it is ridiculous that they charged us $400.00 to do our taxes without informing us how long it would be to get our money and giving us the option to either go somewhere else or do them ourselves and save all that money.
I went and received the anticipation loan and was approved and so I went on Saturday 16th with my w'2 and was told that I was approved for the RAL loan. Well half way in the progress I was told at this time I wasn't approved! Do they even know what they are doing? So, before we left she told me 1-3 days. Well I guess that was better than waiting a week so I was like okay then. I was already lied to once so anyways it has been since last Saturday without money! And now they want to tell me it was going to be 1-4. Well they changed since then and now it's going to be the earliest as Jan 29th or Feb. 5th. That is past 8-15 days! so I called the republic bank in Louisville KY and the guy told me the 29th will be the earliest they will receive my money from the IRS.I also asked why I wasn't approved for the RAL and now he said well since you owed a debt last year they turned you down. Since I owed a small amount of child support last year and even though I am clear this year they turned me down. Let's just say this year will be the last year I deal with Jackson Hewitt and I will let everyone know what happened and I will post the complaint URL everywhere that I can. Don't think I won't stand in the parking lot and warn these innocent people of what they are scamming for cause I will. This is a very poor way of running a business and if you all can see my story and the rest on this page is the same. Identical. So don't go to Jackson Hewitt! They will rip you off and I did the same as everyone else on here. I made financial arrangements and I pray to god these bill people will work with me because guess what? That would be just another time for me to be able to tell someone else about how poor their service is and this done it for me. You can thank yourself Jackson Hewitt that you have lost several customers and some of these been there 6-10 years and longer.
I was informed that I was approved for the RAL. But after finishing my taxes, I was declined for the RAL. Then, I was informed it would be 8-15 days after this. I was informed it wouldn't be until Jan. 29th or the 1st of Feb. That is longer than 8-15 days. Now I just called to check the status of my refund and again was given a different day this time. They said it would be the 29th of Jan. or the 5th of Feb. Now I don't know but we are paying a lot of money to be lied to about what day the money is supposed to come. I strongly believe I will not be dealing with Jackson and Hewitt again even now I've been there for 8 years.
I was told that I would receive my refund in 3 to 5 days and have not heard from them. I have made financial arrangements based on what Jackson Hewitt told me about my return. I am now in default for some bills that were due.
I am so upset as well as all of you. I have been filing my taxes with Jackson Hewitt for 7 years now and have always been approved for the RAL loan. I am a single mother and depend on my money every year because Christmas is the month before and I buy on Christmas always knowing I can get my taxes done early and catch up on my bills by the middle of January. Well, this year like all others, I went in to file my taxes thinking I would get it back the same day. I even talked to the lady while filing it, telling her I always have my money on the card. By the time I walk out of there, I called the card and the funds are there. I told her I guess it's because I pay them over $300 every year so they make a lot of money off me, but I don't mind because I usually need my money for bills that need to be caught up from Christmas. She never once told me that the bank wasn't doing that this year. I would have gone to H&R block to get it back quicker or if I was gonna have to wait 8-15 days, I could have done it myself for free online. That is just outrageous to pay over $300 to have to wait. My taxes aren't hard to figure out. I don't have receipts or own any property. The only reason I have them filed is so I can receive it back the same day! I am so mad, I think they should reimburse me all my money and just let me file it myself!
I filed my taxes on Saturday, January 9th, because I was in need of cash to catch up on bills. I was told that they could not file it with IRS until the 15th, which was fine since I applied for the RAL (one to two-business day loan). On Wednesday, January 20th, I called the Jackson Hewitt's office to check on the status of the return and the loan. They told me that they were working on my return which meant that they had not filed it with the IRS yet even though it has already been four days after the date they said they would file it. They informed me that they would call me when the return had been accepted by the IRS. The call did not come until the 21st. He informed me that the return was accepted but I had been turned down for the RAL. I was in total shock because I have applied for the RAL for over 10 years and was always approved with no problem. But this time, I was turned down. I have read several complaints with the same problem. I think that this is some type of scam this year to have people pay for the RAL and turn them down but do not give any refunds for the RAL request. I would like to register a formal complaint against Jackson Hewitt and Republic Bank. I will not let Jackson Hewitt prepare my taxes ever again.
I went into the Jackson Hewitt office on January 15th and asked if they were doing the RAL loans and was told yes. I had them prepare my taxes and was told that I would be receiving my refund in 1 to 2 business days. This weekend fell over the MLK day weekend but they were still open. After two days had passed, the IRS kick back the return because on of the social security numbers was imputed into the computer was wrong! We called Jackson Hewitt and they called the IRS and fixed the problem! The IRS approved the return! When I contacted Jackson Hewitt, they told me that I wasn't approved for the RAL loan but did qualify for their AL loan and that we could expect a check to be ready to be picked up in 8 to 15 business days but they could come in earlier! I went into Jackson Hewitt yesterday to try to figure this all out and they told us that the check wouldn't be here until after the first of Febuary! But that their banks drop the checks to them on Thursdays and Fridays so here I am with no return, no check and a bunch of lies and screw ups on Jackson Hewitt's part! Their paperwork said 8 to 15 days. The IRS approved it. What is the hold up? They lie to their customers about the RAL loans, lie about the AL loans and they have no clue when your going to get your money. These people are crooks, taking advantage of tax payers and something needs to be done! Pretty much you pay them $250 plus bank fees for them to approve you for a loan that doesn't exist. That is stealing! Do not use them. They get your refund and pretty much tell you that, "You aren't going to get your money until we decide to call you and give it to you!" Because of the money that Jackson Hewitt was to return to me, I've had my phones disconnected because I was anticipating they money when they said they would give it to me. My family needs food and we have bills to pay! It seems that the banks they are using are getting the fees from people denying them their "loans" sitting on the IRS checks and collecting interest off the money that isn't theirs to have! This has to be illegal
I called Jackson to find out if I could get their RAL loan this year and was fed the same line as all of you. Do you know anyone who has received this loan? Then they finally told me no one would be giving RALs this year. I decided to find out on my own. HR block is doing RALs and Instant loans this year, and JH knew they did not have any funding before Jan. 2010 and lied to us all so we would still come there thinking we could get our money!
I was passing through a place I used to call home to visit some family. Since I was there, I decided to file my taxes while I had plenty of time. This had been my first time to use Jackson-Hewitt Tax Service, and the only reason I used them was because an H&R Block was not close by. I went to one of their locations in a super Walmart located in Sand Springs, OK. I had told the lady I was military and passing through. I had applied for the RAL and we finished up the paper work and I was to expect my return in five to six days, give or take. I called the 800 number that she provided to check the status of my tax return to only hear that my RAL had been denied. Not a good thing, for I had already left the state heading for my destination. Now, I cannot even get in touch with the exact person who prepared my taxes. I even attempted calling the Walmart there in Sand Springs, OK and spoke with a woman who worked there and asked her please get the lady from the Jackson Hewitt Tax Service up front if you can. I didn't have a direct number to her. I think it is very important for the customer to be able to reach the very person who prepared their taxes so when problems like this arise, it can be solved easier. In conclusion, she never even stated that I'd be denied a RAL, and I will remember not to use Jackson Hewitt next year or any year to come. So, almost ten days later, and no tax Return--a very unsatisfied customer!
I went on 1-15-10 to file my taxes and I was asked did I want to file RAL. I said yes because I promised to pay my rent and car note the next day, which was past due. I have been with 8 years and have never had a problem with getting my check the next day. She told it would be in Saturday or Monday. When I got the call I was excited only to be told I was denied. Never in 8 years have I been denied and I don’t owe the government. So what happened? She should have told me upfront so I could file where I could get the money back. Now I hope my landlord will wait. Now I am told it will be on the 29th. Consequence: I’m being evicted and might lose my car.
Went in to Jackson and Hewitt on Thursday Jan 14. I was told IRS would accept the returns on Friday Jan 15. So I paid for a RAL which supposed to get me my money in 1-2 days. So six days and $ 464 later, I still don't have my money and nothing but a bunch of excuses. The funny part is the woman that does my taxes talk to me about nothing but her personal life. I was only asked two questions related to my return. I think there should be a lot more requirements to be a tax preparer. I definitely will never go back. Three guarantees and not one can guarantee my money.
Krystal filed my taxes wrong then lied and told me it could be corrected in a number of days. When I called to schedule to have the mistake corrected, she told me it was too late. It was already being processed with the IRS so I would have to do an amendment at no cost. Today, I tried to schedule to do an amendment. She told me I would have to pay or do it myself. I asked for the number to corporate and she told me she didn't have the number. I got the number to corporate and all they did was apologize. So I paid $184.00 for? All she could tell me is she's new.
I filed my taxes with Jackson Hewitt (this is my first time using them). On January 15th, the first day the IRS was open to receive, I paid for the RAL but was told that I would get it at the latest on the 20th which was fine with me. I was contacted today, January 18th, to be informed that I was denied for the RAL. I have never had this problem before. H&R Block has been doing my taxes for the past 11 years straight but I thought that I would try somewhere new so I tried this place because I had a coupon. Never again! I contacted their bank that denied me and they couldn't tell me why--only that there wasn't a hold on the IRS side so they don't know what it could be.
Jackson Hewitt was setting up at our location Wal-mart where I work last week. I asked the lady if I bring my w-2 into her on Friday, January 8, if she could get my money that same day a week sooner than H&R block. She called her manager Erik and came back and said yes. So, I did my taxes with her on January 8, and then she proceeded to tell me that I would not have my money until the next day or possibly that Monday, January 11. I was bummed out but said to her "Oh okay. At least that is still faster than Friday, Jan. 15." Then on Sunday, January 10, she came over to where I work and said, "I am just the messenger. I just found out from my boss that you will not get your money until Jan. 15, 16, or Monday, 17." I was furious. This is terrible. I was totally lied to. Well, this is Saturday, January 16, and still, there's no money. I paid them $300 for a one-day service that has turned in to over a week so far. If anybody can help, please let me know. I made arrangements with my electric company to pay them and other bills. Now I look like a complete liar. Hopefully, they do not shut my electric off.
Jackson Hewitt Tax Service’s manager, Maurice ** stole my income tax check and had it deposited into his Jackson Hewitt Tax Service payroll account. I ended up having to fight Jackson Hewitt Tax Service for about three months to retrieve my stolen check. IRS Agents advised me that Jackson Hewitt Tax Service’s manager, Maurice ** made fraudulent errors on my income tax check. Maurice ** made those fraudulent errors without my knowledge. At the request of the IRS agents, I had my taxes re-done by another Jackson Hewitt Tax Service manager named Ron, who told me that I now owed IRS $3707. Ron told me to leave the paper work with him. I assumed because all of this was Jackson Hewitt Tax Service’s fault, not mine, as I was victimized by Jackson Hewitt Tax Service’s manager, that they would remedy the situation. I was wrong! When I filed my taxes the following year, I found out differently. I received a letter from the IRS the following February saying that I owed IRS $3707 plus penalties and fees, from April 15th the year prior, which included the time I was not even in control of my check because it was stolen. I now owed IRS over $4000, including $99.00 rapid refund service charge that Jackson Hewitt’s manager, Maurice ** added in to get my refund check deposited into his account. I had to miss two days from work to testify against Singleton who was prosecuted and sent to jail. There were three other people who also had their checks stolen by **, who also testified against him. There was a host of others that ** made the same and/or similar fraudulent errors on their tax returns, who had to get their taxes done over and also ended up owing the IRS thousands of dollars, just like me. This was no fault of ours. I/We came to Jackson Hewitt Tax Service to have our taxes done by a reputable company. While I believe Jackson Hewitt Tax Service should assume responsibility for all this mess, Jackson Hewitt Tax Service has not at the very least even offered me an apology, let alone pay the penalties and fees which is supposed to be their basic guarantee for any errors. Jackson Hewitt does not stand by their work.
I went to file my taxes today at Jackson Hewitt. Well, I was told that they did not do the RAL. Fine. I asked the preparer if any other tax place do the RAL. She told me no, that hers just came from a meeting and was told that no one would be doing the RAL anymore, that it was no longer available. I just got off the phone with H&R Block and was told that they do the RAL. I called Jackson Hewitt back and was told that they could not give me my stuff back and that they had already start filing my taxes. This is the first year that they have ever filed my taxes this quickly. I have been with this company for seven years and they have never filed my taxes this quick. This company is full of it and I will never use them again. I was told that the office manager would give me a call back so she could try to stop it. I waited for her to call back, no call. Thirty minutes later, I called her. Guess what? She was not busy at all transferred straight to her. I was told she could not stop it, of course not. You just waited 30 minutes so my paperwork could be put in. They did not want to lose the $200 for preparing my taxes. Well, they just lost a customer. I will never use this company ever again.
In November 2009 I applied for line of credit loan on my taxes. I was advised that in January 2, 2010 if I bring in last paystub of the year I could apply for another $600.00 line of credit which is a total of $1200.00 that the bank is offering. Even a couple days later I received a postcard from Jackson Hewitt stating that as of 1-2-10 I could apply for the $600.00 line of credit. Well January 2, 2010 I went to them and they were closed. I was mad I wasted gas when they were supposed to be open. So I went again Monday January 4, 2010 the sign on door said they opened at 10am I waited from 10am to 10:15am no one came. I called the main branch. I told him I and several other customers were waiting and no one came to open location he said they should be there and to wait few more minutes. I called him back 15 minutes later to tell him still no one came and a lot of customers left. He asked me if I was applying for line of credit. I said yes I got flyer to do so in my mail. He says the bank didn’t approve them doing it yet so all customers had to wait to see if bank decides to continue to do line of credit. He says he will take my name and number and call me when customers could apply. Well here it is January 9, 2010 and I haven’t heard from them. I called them several times during the past week. I called 3 locations they all the Jackson Hewitt locations say the same thing. But says they are waiting on the bank and they will write down names of customers so customers don’t have to keep calling to see if the bank gave them the okay. They said hopefully Monday the bank will approve Jackson to do the line of credit for customers which will be January 11, 2010. I am pretty sure when I call them Monday they will say the same thing which is the bank hasn’t allowed them to do it yet. I am furious this is false advertisement. They sent post cards out to customers stating January 2, 2010 customers could apply for the line of credit and they lied. I want to file complaint they are false advertising and they should be at the office at 10am like their sign says. If I would’ve known they weren’t going to do the line of credit I would’ve have went to [competitor]. I was depending on that line of credit. They shouldn’t advertise things that aren’t true. I was depending on that money for rent this month and now I can’t pay my rent and my account will have items bouncing and overdrawing
I received a flyer from this company in November stating that I could come in and get a loan on my taxes. I called to see if I needed to make an appointment, and the customer service agent told me no and that the office I wanted to go to was closing but to go ahead and go in the following morning when they first opened. The next morning, I was at the office waiting for them to open. I think that the office was supposed to open at 10:00 am. At 10:30 am, the office was still not open. I called the customer service line and was told that the previous night was the last night for the loan. Then loan had started 4 days prior to this day. But I did not receive the flyer before it started. The customer service agent told me to keep checking for them to start the loan again in January. So I started checking on the website beginning January 2. On 01/08/2010, I received another flyer in the mail stating that they had started the loan again. I didn't even pay attention to the date that this loan had started. I got all the paperwork together and headed to Jackson Hewitt. I was greeted by a rude tax preparer and an empty office. I asked if they were working by appointment only. The lady stated, "What do you want?" I pulled out the flyer, and she pointed to a date and stated that the loans were over. I looked at the flyer, and I stated that it said that these loans started on 01/04/2010. She stated, "Well, I'm sorry; it has ended." I have done business with this company for many years and paid lots of money to have my taxes prepared. Last year, I even did their iPower card and paid their fees for using my money. I feel that even though their fine prints state that they have the right to stop the loans at anytime, it is still false advertisement, because they fix it to where a lot of people get these flyers after the end date. But of course, it is a large corporation, and we are just the little people.
The people in Jackson, Tennessee were told they could get the second I-Power loan from Hewitt on January 4, 2010. I did and I was told that the bank had a crash in their system, but would definitely have the system up and going by the next morning, first thing that morning. Well, it is now 01/08/2010 and the system is still down, or so we are told, I just feel like everyone in Jackson, Tennessee is being scammed by Jackson Hewitt. Because of this delay I am $133.00 short in my checking account because I was relying on that money to cover bills that I had paid. I would have never relied on it if I would not have been told I would definitely get the loan the next morning. Because of this delay I am $133.00 short in my checking account because I was relying on that money to cover bills that I had paid. I would have never relied on it if I would not have been told I would definitely get the loan the next morning.
I received a postcard in the mail from Jackson Hewitt and MetaBank stating that they are starting the ipower loans as of January 2, 2009. Well, I went there on Saturday. They never opened. I went there on Monday andwas told, "We could file, but the bank hasn't issued the funds yet." Now here, it is November 9, and Jackson Hewitt is still saying the bank has not issued the funds to any Jackson Hewitt in the state of Maryland. What I find extremely funny is today, January 9, I received another postcard stating I could come in and do the loan. But when I called, they said it wasn't available. This is a horrible way to do business, so I then called MetaBank, and they said Jackson Hewitt basically doesn't know what they are doing. My point is I only go to Jackson Hewitt to get the loan. If they are not going to do it, I would urge anyone ** off to go to H&R Block and file, and then the following year, you can do the Emerald loan! I have been with Jackson Hewitt for 13 years, and I will never go back. I and my 4 sisters go there, and it is just really ridiculous! Don't send me a postcard, wasting paper, when you are sending me something that is a lie and you're not even offering it.
Customers who have been struck with these tough economic crisis are applying for a money now loan. The program starts around Christmas but decided to run the program for Christmas and again starting Jan 4, 2010. Today is the 4th of January and the offices in Daytona are backed up on top of system crashes. Walk-ins are allowed though appointments are honored first. I walked in at 10 am and sat until 12:45 pm. The Manager alerted us that the wait time was extensive and we should make appointments for later in the day. I made the 2:00 pm appointment only to find that 12:30 appointments weren't even called, let alone the 1:00pm or 1:300 pm appts. So I came in and sat down talking with people next to me to pass the time not about the company but about our lives. Everyone was panicking because we've spent pretty much a half of day in Jackson Hewitt. So after confirming the system crash, the manager, Mary ***, blurts at me, ill tempered, that I haven't been waiting until 10. Her words to me directly were, "And you haven't been waiting until 10 either!" I told her not with an appointment. I walked in which was allowed. Being that the place was crowded, I made an appointment for 2 pm. She's acting groggy like she's drilling me for being there waiting the way that I should. I asked her who is her manager and she said she is the big manager, So I asked for her corporate office number. She told me to find it in front of everyone waiting. I said there has to be someone over you at the top of the totem pole. She would give me no info so I asked her name. She gave me her name. I knew as a citizen of the US that I had the right to request someone's name operating a business. Maybe because so many people listened and witnessed it, she was forced to continue to give me the info I requested. Some of the people left because they did not like the fact that we all waited so long to put up with a district manager whose attitude was nasty and offensive and on top of it all, owned the store at the location we're trying to get help from. She has the type of attitude that drives you away not honoring your loyalty to the company or how many years you've filed with them. It's scary that people like that run a business.
Everyone received a paper in the mail stating that Jackson Hewitt on Merritt blvd. in Dundalk would be open Jan. 2nd 2010 for the new loan and there was also a yellow letter on their door stating they would be opening as well, well there were about 75 of us standing outside their office from 9-11 waiting for them to open, never opening, finally went back at 3 and some man came in took the notice off the door after 5-6 hours of everyone waiting to get in. He said they forgot to take the notice down. I just think it was really rude to advertise something even have a note on the door stating you are going to be open and then just not come in. Poor business, I and all those people have used Jackson Hewitt many years and I bet a lot of them including myself will not be back for their poor services.
I had my 2005 taxes prepared by Jennifer **. I always have all my paperwork and amounts listed for her. I moved from Maryland to Virginia in that tax year. She completed my taxes and I signed off on 3/9/06. She was paid $332 for the service. I found out months ago, by the Virginia tax assessment office, that I double paid my taxes for 2005. I was repeatedly told that the law states I cannot get that overpayment back. But, since I went through Jackson Hewitt, they are responsible. Due to your insurance and liability, I called Jennifer's office and left a message that I wanted my $905 back. I waited impatiently for a response. I did not get one. When I called again, her assistant, Patty, informed me that the paperwork had been shredded. I responded quite loudly, "That was an appropriate thing to do when you messed up." Again I stated that I want my money back, due to the fact that they were paid for the service. Needless to say, I no longer go to them due to their prices. To this day, they have not made 1 attempt to contact me, as I have caller ID, to correct their error. I have spoken with the Virginia Assessment Office on many occasions, in reference to the Maryland and Virginia receipt program. I was even laughed at when they were discussing my double payment, due to Jackson Hewitt. I can't imagine doing business and continuing to do business without being accountable for your errors.
I went into this particular Jack Hewitt and was seen by an individual named Hattie. I’m not sure what her last name is. I brought her a reminder letter from the IRS that stated that I owed certain monies for whatever reasons but at that time, I wasn't even sure what that letter meant. So I asked Hattie what she thought it meant and she said it was stating that I hadn't filed my taxes from 2006 and she also confirmed this with another lady by the name of Linda. Then Hattie proceeded to file the tax return and once it got to how much I owed Jack Hewitt, Hattie said I had to pay Jack Hewitt $217 to prepare the taxes and that my refund total would be one hundred something from the state and $323 fed tax. I postdated a check for the amount she said I owed Jack Hewitt and then left the store. I waited a month and didn’t get anything directly deposited into my account. So I went back up there today, 29 Dec. ‘09 and asked Hattie about my return. She gave me the IRS number and my refund amount. I called the customer care for the IRS and the woman told me that I had doubled filed for those particular taxes and the refund that I was waiting on that Hattie had told me about really was me owing the IRS. By this time, that particular check had already cleared so Jack Hewitt received my money and I still owe the IRS because Hattie interpreted that reminder letter the wrong way. So I spoke with the district manager, a guy by the name of Scott ** and he specifically told me that I would not receive my money back when it was his employee who was wrong. The way they said that would fix my issues are by trying to do whatever they can to fix the balance that I owe the IRS. I am not satisfied with this and I have done business with Jack Hewitt for years. I trust them more than any other tax prep companies. All I want is for the monies to be returned to me so I can afford to pay my IRS balance off but I had Gophers.
I got a settlement on the Jackson Hewitt lawsuit and when I got the second check, it bounced and Jackson Hewitt charged me $3.00 for it bouncing.
Back in 2006 I had my taxes prepaired by Jackson Hewitt and at the time I also brought the gold guratee this service is used when JH Makes a mistake with your taxes and they pay for it. 2009 I get a letter from the IRS Telling me that I own them money for my 2006 taxes because who ever done my taxes then did not add my 1092 and other documents.which i gave to them.

2006 and 2007 returns were done by Jackson Hewitt at 9th Avenue and 42nd St. David H. did the return. For a little extra money, I bought the Gold Gaurantee, which states that they will cover costs and taxes and interest up to 5K for any errors they did on their returns. While having my 2008 taxes done at another Jackson Hewitt on 14th Street by David R., he discovered that David H. had incorrectly filed my taxes, stating my gross income as much less than I had provided to him on a P and L that I supplied to him. I did not catch this error myself at the time of filing as I had the flu at the time. David R. noticed that the numbers on the previous year 2007 looked off and when he looked into it further told me they had to be redone. Upon further investigation, David H. had done 2006 wrong as well. David R. said he would amend them, however he closed shop just after the 20th of April and was not available to make the ammends. So upon calling Jackson Hewitt I was sent to another jackson hewitt in astoria, and John S. on Ditmars Blvd ammended the three years of taxes, however he said I would have to go back to the original jackson hewitts that did my returns the first time in order to claim my gold gaurantee because he did not offer that at his location. Those other offices were closed for the season, so I called Jackson Hewitt customer care and was given a case number and told someone would call me. a month later a call came and a man referred me to another office in Queens on Astoria Blvd to work with Kiki, so made an appointment, lugged all the returns and the ammended returns, she photocopied them reluctantly and told me she would forward them mto the proper people. That was in September of 2009. I called to check in on november 20th, 2009. Kiki only remembered who I was after I re-explained the situation. She was surprised I did not get any calls, and said she would check with her branch supervisor, and that I should call client care. in the meantime, I filed two of the three amended returns with the irs, and paid some of the now due money, which amounts to an additional 15 K approximately. I dont have that to pay at the moment, and was hoping to collect on my gold gaurantee. When I called Client Care I was routed to the Phillipeans, where I spoke to a girl with challenged english and intellegence. Eventually she refered me to her supervisor, who explained to mem that all she could do was forward my complaint the owner of the 9th Avenue location. I asked her where a lawyer should send them a letter and she did not have an address for that. Basically they keep passing the responsibility to the now closed branches, so nothing happens. Help me if you can. I am being put in an endless loop. They are not being cooperative in following through on their gaurantee, which has cost me 15 K in additional taxes owed due to their errors that should have been covered in the gold gaurantee. I also paid those franchiseses each about 300 dollars for each return, then another 300 for the ammendment of the three years of returns. This also affected my new york state returns and my self employment taxes negatively.
I used Jackson Hewitt for my tax service for the '07 tax year. I have 2 children but only get to claim 1. The preparer had a hard time with this and kept juggling the numbers back and forth, he didn't know which number to put in the spot for claiming the child or vs the number to put as claiming as just a dependant in the household. Needless to say he messed up. He ended up claiming my other child for the child tax credit. I have contacted the home office in New Jersey and the office in Elizabethtown Ky, that is over my district. No one is owning up to the mistake and they do not want to stand behind thier mistake. All they want to say is I should have purchased the Gold Plan. Which this preparer told me it was a waste to buy. That it only covered if you were audited they would go with you. So, when I filed my '08 taxes I was flagged. Now come taxes for '09 I'm the one that is going to get flagged that I owe money. I am very frustrated and angry. I cannot afford to pay this amount of money to the irs especially when it was not my error. Pls Help!! What can I do about this??
Went to Jackson Hewitt on February 22,2008 to file our 2007 taxes. Was charged $308.00. Two weeks ago I received a letter from the IRS saying I owed 30,595.22 plus interest and penalties. I also was not offered their Gold Guarantee at the time of service (Which I would have taken for peace of mind) I have been severely stressed, constantly crying and worried beyond belief.
I scheduled an appointment to meet with a tax preparer. I was told that the office I wanted to visit was by appt. only so I set up a time. They left me a voicemail a couple hours before my appointment stating that since I had not confirmed my appointment they had cancelled. I called and the lady I spoke with said that my appointment was still on the calendar so to keep traveling to the office. After 40 mins. in traffic she called me back and said the office was closed and she offered to reschedule. She was nice but stated that she didn't really know their practices since she was just filling in so I asked for a manager. I talked to both the manager and the general manager and they were unorganized, not accountable and basically stated that it was my fault because I failed to confirm. The solutions they offered served their needs and had no regard for the customer. Very disappointing response especially when the general manager said "good luck finding someone open to do your taxes during the off season". I wondered if there were others with customer feedback and found a lot here. I don't believe Jackson Hewitt or their franchise owners are reputable. I would strongly suggest that customers look elsewhere. There has to be a company with better customer service and able to perform quality work.
Jackson Hewitt prepared our taxes for 2007 on 3/8/08. The IRS sent us a letter requesting more info received 10/2/09. We have been trying to contact Jackson Hewitt offices ever since. I called SpringHill Avenue office in Mobile got recordings. The final recording was of a male obviously a foreigner and said office only opened on Thursday. Called Airport Blvd location in Mobile and number no good. Called Hillcrest location and number no good. Called Saraland, Alabama location and number no good. Called Cottage Hill office and spoke to Autumn. She says that we need to go to the office that we had taxes prepared. Explained our dilema. Only 30 days to respond to IRS. Explained that I cannot get anyone on the phone. Called Friday to Springhill office and still no response. Called again today. Keeping a complete log of calls made and contacts made otherwise. I have gone to website and placed complaint there too. Called Customer Service and got male who could hardly speak English. Turns out he's in the Phillipines? I asked for Corporate Office Number - he gave me 973-. Called this number in New Jersey and all I can get is recordings. We purchased the GOLD GUARANTEE for $35.00 and now can get no assistance, no return call and no personal contact. How can you honor GOLD GUARANTEE if there is no representative to contact? What did I pay for? I am documenting all calls made since Friday. I do intend to find out why I cannot get services that I paid for under this contract.
My husband and I went Jackson Hewitt to file our taxes. My husband had to file the last year because he didn't do it the first time. We gave them all of our information W2 and all. That was in 2008. To this day our taxes have never been filed. Not only that but the representative that prepared our taxes wen through her own personal tax company, so all of our private information is at her house... Way to run a business. So now we are still fighting with them to get all ouf our documents back so we can file our taxes. Now we have penalty fees and what ever the IRS is going to tack on. I feel that they should be responsible for all the fees and for paying for our taxes to be prepared by someone else.
I went in on Feb. 4th to have my taxes filled out. She entered the wrong information and didn't ask for a last look of approval. My taxes were sent to the wrong address, in the wrong city and was sent back to the IRS. Six months later, I am still struggling with trying to get my refund! I will never use Jackson Hewitt again and certainly not recommend them.
I went to Jackson Hewlett to have my taxes completed. Once completed by Tax Rep Angelia on Mar 17 there about, I received a letter from IRS stating we owed approx $1,300.00. As per Tax professional request, we bring in our signed the gold acceptance letter as well as complete folder of 2007 filing. I took required documentation to Angelia and she said all documentation was in order and Jackson Hewitt would take care of this since it was their filing mistake. She stated that's why it was so great we had the gold guarantee. Also, she stated that I shouldn’t worry and it will be taken care of. Angelia stated the process was someone from the home office would come to JFK location, take to corporate office and proceed getting this matter resolved. Now, it has been 3 months and now Mrs. ** stated she doesn't have the file any longer. Jackson Hewitt rep David will be going to JFK office and search through the packed up records. I’m currently awaiting call back from Mrs. ** on findings at JFK Location. JH has lost the record and now stated I must contact IRS and former employer to get a copy of my records. I will have to repay the $1,300.00 and the money I spent for the so called gold acceptance guarantee well as complete folder of 2007 filing. Plus, currently, our family is under a lot of stress financially and emotionally. This is uncalled for.
I had my taxes done for 2006 and they told me I owed it all on student loans. I found out on June 19, 2009 that the federal taxes were sent to an account and I was lied to. I feel scammed. I lost $638.
After preparing our 2007 taxes, it was found that my husband and I owe $3,358 including interest of $206.00 due to errors made by the Jackson Hewitt staff. Improper preparation of my husband's retirement pension and my social security, which was both reported to the tax preparer, resulted in an enormous payment owed to the IRS. We would like to have Jackson Hewitt be held responsible for not preparing taxes correctly which resulted in a large amount owed by us which is unreasonable. Jackson Hewitt fails to accept responsibility for this erroneous problem.
I went to Jackson Hewitt on 3/14/09. I was charged $250 after $30 coupon applied which I felt too expensive. Dan who was an accountant didn't give me copies of Tax returns or a mailing out envelop either so that I returned to the office at the following week. He passed me an envelop of some other office's. I belive that he tricked on me and ripped me off. I am afraid if my tax retunes are correct. Anyway, I strongly sugget anybody never go to Jackson Hewitt Tax Service.
I have been doing taxes with Jackson Hewitt for 13 years and this past year 2009 I have never been so humiliated. I was hung up on 5 times yelled at and disrespected. I will be going to another tax preperation place next year. I have not ever had a problem with jackson hewitt until this year. and to call a manager is like trying to walk around the world in 3 days. Jackson hewitt is very unorganized. I really hope they get their prioritys straight. I guess they forgot with out customers they have no buisness. its customers that makes a business. and with out customers is no business. I never thought that poeple could curse and disrespect there customers that way and hang up on them just because they want to know why they paid so much for there taxes to be done and returned in 2 days and it takes 2 weeks and you dont get a refund for waiting a additional week because they say that it is not there fault. but they put the information in the computer and they tell you when your check will be here and then you get a run around because it takes addition week to get your money. I will not return to jackson hewitt next year I will find another tax preperation.
On April 29, 2009, Franchise Owner Michael Oerth, CPA prepared my taxes. It took about 1/2 hour. I asked before the appt how much it would cost he told me $30-50.00. After preparation he told me $275.00. I was shocked. He told me I had to pay it. He also told me I could have my taxes by May 8th and charged $38.00 extra. May 19, 2009, to date I do not have my check even though per the IRS it was deposited into Jackson Hewitt's account on May 15, 2009. I had to file a complaint with the PA District Attorney office in hopes I will get my check for over $3,000.00. Jackson Hewitt Customer Service blamed it all on Mr. Oerth and said they have no control over the Franchise Owners. Beware of Jackson Hewitt and don't use the one in Chalfont, PA or the Montgomery Mall in North Wales, PA.
Jacksonhewitt deposited our refund check in their account on March 13, 2009. Now they are closed for business. They never called us to let us know anything. What a scam on their part. Please help.
This was my first complaint I wrote, but decided to put the complaint on hold thinking Jackson Hewitt would handle things professionally this is the result of what representative of Jackson Hewitt informed me to do: I have tried numerous times to get someone to help with an issue I have with my taxes that were done by Jackson Hewitt. I had my taxes prepared at JH, in 2007 for my 2006 tax return. Well last year, I was notified from the IRS that I owe money back not due to filing my taxes paying the government back, but a mistake by Jackson Hewitt, where they put in the wrong income earned than the form I gave the preparer. I have never in all my years of getting my taxes filed had any tax preparer make up numbers, change to get more back nothing, this was an error by Jackson Hewitt. I sent my information with my return back to the IRS disputing this over 4100 payment they claim I now owe, because Jackson Hewitt put an amount that was lower than my actual salary amount. I was counting on my income tax return in full that was filed for 2008, to save my home from foreclosure. I wrote and faxed over a third appeal due to hardship to the IRS, that while under dispute not to take my Federal Tax return because of that, while I am trying to get Jackson Hewitt to be held accountable for their mistake. It looks as though now that my return was taken and I am at a loss, my home will have to go for foreclosure, I am behind 3 months do to job loss, and now working as a temp making 55,000.00 less than what I made prior to my unemployment last year. I was not notified by mail from the IRS that they declined my 3rd request, I can not get no one from Jackson Hewitt to fix there mistake and be accountable for paying for there error, I am looking to be put out on the street by the end of this month because of this and I do not know what to do. After all this, this was my result when I did not hear from Sharon after first contact on the 11th of March(09): Sharon W sent requested information to look at my complaint, called once to ask me to fax over information, never heard from again, come to find out she no longer works for Jackson Hewitt on 05/01/09. Marietza called back, second time, first call person was a Lauren, it took them only 15 minutes to look over my 2006 tax return complaint to call me back and say, since I took money out against my 401K instead of an IRA for my home closing cost in 2005, that is the reason I owed back money, now it is my word against theirs. I had my form from Infidelity that I brought in with me to have my taxes done, I keep all my tax files like most of Americans in the folder from the place I had it done, and filed it, that is why it did not take me long when I first complained to send all my tax information for 2006 although we were in 09 now. So, her answer was, I must did not bring in the form because if I did it would have been added, nice to assume it was me that did not bring the form or a past employee who just did not enter all me information. I know they are not thorough that is why I stop going to Jackson Hewitt because they could not put my information on right, because I worked in NY, but lived in NJ, oh that confused them, were my return totaled out to one thing, then it was different after 5 minutes, until I had to say it does not sound right, come to find out the guy on 06 that was preparing my taxes forgot to check NY, so it is also possible that maybe he forgot to add my form in there also because the paperwork was there. It is amazing how companies do not have to own up to mistakes and quickly accuse the customer when they have no clue what happened. No, solution, no I am sorry to have made you wait over 2 months without anyone even knowing there was a complaint sitting on Sharons desk that never was looked at, or blaming me on not bringing in a form, because that is the only way they can say we were not wrong. Out of filing my taxes for over 8yrs, I have never not forgot to give my tax documents I receive, I take everything, and this is the first time my taxes was done by a place that screwed it up so bad, putting me in emotional distressed, the money that was taken by the IRS from my 09 tax return was the money to keep my home 4400, and all I get in 2 months, with no one looking at it, to 15 minutes of oh, you must did not give us this form when you came in, I am not trying to settle for that.
I filed my taxes on the last day of tax season (4/15/09) with Jackson Hewitt and now I have no way of picking up my check because all the offices in my area are closed. I called the IRS yesteday and I was told that my check will be available to jackson hewitt May 1st 2009. I called jackson hewitts customer service line and got no help not what so ever. I call the office and it goes to a full voicemail. I filed a complaint last week and someone was supposed to get back to me and I have never received a call. I walk past 2 jackson hewitts everyday and they are always closed. I was told by a cust. rep. that they are open on Wednesdays which is not true they were closed last wednesday and today I spoke to a guy that worked next door and he said they have been closed for some time now. I just want to be able to pick up my check friday when it will be released by the IRS.
I had my taxes done with them in January 2009. I believed that they were giving me every deduction available to me, as they state they do. Well in March of 2009 I received a call from an H&R Block represenative that they were giving away a free second look at taxes and wondered if I was interested in having them look at my taxes. I accepted the offer and made an appointment. They did the second look and explained to me that I would have to pay them an ammended fee if I were to get a return, and nothing if they couldn't get any more money. I accepted. They did the second look and found that I was to receive an additional 525.00. Before I decided to do the return I called Jackson Hewitt to see what they would say about this. The lady was extremely rude and said that they stand behind their preperation of my taxes, etc..... I explained what I was going to do and asked her if i could get my preperation fees back minus any interest. She said she could give me half. I declined the offer and after a few more minutes of backand forth I threatened to call my local Better Business Bureau- She said go ahead. She probably didn't think I would. But let me tell you that I did. This is my taxes for crying out loud. I have two children and I don't make enough money the wat it is. So I paid H&R 212.00. Just to get the 525.00. Yes I know it sounds a little silly, but it isn't when I deserve to have my full amount. And anything could help me at this time. So BBB has been trying to contact them,I have been doing my follow ups - with out any response until now and they responded with lies in a letter and said that I received more money due to being a student that I am not. And that they would give me a 75.00 credit towards next year. Do they really think that after all of that, that I would return to have them do my taxes. So I declined there offer they made to BBB. They told complete and utter lies in a letter to BBB. I received a copy of the letter and was extremely hurt over it. I have paid them to do my taxes for the last 4 years, and this is how they treat me. This really hurts that I pay them all this money for complete deception.
Recieved a call at 10:00AM in regard to tax. Did not give prime formulation (social security, employer identification(s) over the phone conversation with "Katherine" Should not recieve any marketing calls as I registered to the "do not call" of the federal government Self-proclaimed as timid and sensitive to sensory stimulation:no direct questioning should have been necessary to complete the tax that was requested to the company (Jackson Hewitt)?
I first had Jackson Hewitt prepare my personal and business taxes in 2008. The person doing my taxes made numerous mistakes on the return, including spelling my name incorrectly and listing the wrong amount of paid estimated taxes. However, the IRS in the end did send me the correct refund and I was happy. I decided I would give them another try, but at a different location and with a different preparer in 2009 since I was already in their system and the process should be quite simple. I had an appointment on March 24th, in which I brought in all of my paperwork. I was told that I would receive a call if there were any questions or when my taxes were finished. When I did not receive a call by the second week in April, I started getting nervous and called the location on April 9th. I was told they just had a little more to do and it would be done on Saturday April 11th, and they would call me to setup an appointment. I never got a call so I called again on April 13th. I was told that the person doing my taxes had been out sick and that he would call me in 20 minutes, after he talked to the owner to see the status of my taxes. I never got a call after 5 more hours, so I called and spoke with that person again and expressed my concern as the deadline was quickly approaching. He assured me that I would get a call on April 14th. By 4PM, I still had not heard anything. I called around 4:30PM and was told that someone was looking over my return and would give me a call. I got a call from a different location at 6:25PM. It was the woman who had prepared my return in 2008. She asked if my company was an LLC and when I said yes, she stated that Jackson Hewitt cannot prepare returns for an LLC because their software does not have that capability. I asked her, "If that is the case, then how did you prepare my return last year?" She responded that I never told her the company was an LLC and that is not how they have me in the computer. My company has LLC right in the name and I had told her numerous times during the interview that it was an LLC. I believe that she was lying in order to get rid of me because they did not have time to complete my return this close to the deadline and their particular location closes after April 15th. She said that the other office had sent over my paperwork and that it would be at her office on April 15th for me to pickup. So here I am after Jackson Hewitt had my paperwork for three weeks having to hurry up and file an extension and take my business elsewhere. This is possibly the most unprofessional company I have ever dealt with in my life.
I have done my taxes with Jackson Hewitt since ‘98 or ’99. I have done it at different locations here in our town and every time I did my taxes, they would say (tax preparer) that I owe on preparer fees from somewhere in the year of ‘98 through 2001. And I would explain every year that I do not owe this; they would say that they would check into it. My concern is that every year since this initial problem that every year that they are charging me for this, and how could I prove this and how much money have they taken from me and how could I get it back? With the economy in the shape, I find it to be theft by deception and that Jackson Hewitt should be audited to find out where this money is. What is really going on? I know now that they have lost my business! It’s devastating to wonder if companies are stealing from hard working people such as myself and many others. These people are sharks and are stealing from us, and it is depressing. I know down in my heart that they have charged me for many years for this so called fee every time I get my taxes done. But what can we do to recoup our money? I have children and we need our money.
This involves my 2007 taxes prepared by Jackson Hewitt. I retired this year so I took all my information and had them prepare taxes. On correspondence dated March 16, 2009, I received a notice from the Federal Government that I owed an additional $6,720, plus penalties of $1,344 and interest of $488, for a total of $8,512. Also, on my state taxes, I will owe another $840.00. All I have now is social security as I used funds last year to pay off my home and my auto. I immediately took a copy of the tax return in to Jackson Hewitt. They kept it for a few days, and then indicated that I had rolled over $20,000 and that was where the error was, and I was responsible for the $8,512. I told the gentleman, a Mr. James **, that I did not roll over any funds. Getting no satisfaction, I went to the Internal Revenue Office on April 15, 2009 to have them take a look and see where the error was. He found it immediately on my 1099R form box 7 - the Distribution Code is 7, which is normal distribution; they coded on my return a G, which is a direct rollover, causing the $20,000 difference in income and resulting in my having to pay $8,512. The IRS indicated that was an error on the part of Jackson Hewitt - just not looking at the materials supplied properly. I believe that they should satisfy this amount due, not me.
I filed my taxes on February 9, 2009. My income from last year was three thousand five hundred dollars. They charged me one hundred eighty seven dollars to file. On March 09, 2009, I received a letter regarding my stimulus check. I contacted the IRS; they informed me that I did not have enough income for last year and there was no reason for me to pay to have my taxes filed. They also informed me that I would receive a stimulus check in the amount of two hundred eighty two dollars and that I needed to contact Jackson Hewitt. The first time I contacted them, they told me I had to get my money from the IRS. I contacted the IRS a second time. They told me that Jackson Hewitt received a check from them and to contact them again regarding my check. So I contacted Jackson Hewitt a second time and they told me they can charge whatever they want to file my taxes. They also told me that they received my stimulus check in the amount of two hundred eighty two dollars, that they were going to charge me one hundred fifty seven dollars in fees so I would only receive one hundred and fifty dollars. Someone needs to do something to this company.
I had my taxes done. When it came time to pick up the refund check, Jackson Hewitt had moved out. And now I cannot get my refund check.
I worked for Jackson Hewitt this tax season. I was working 60-70 hour weeks for them, working between 4 different stores, and never had a problem. I just had my review, and it said how great I worked and how I should be a manager and everything. About 2 weeks after that, I was working at a store on a Saturday and took in some cash money. I called the manager to tell them the money was there and left a note to remind them. Come Monday afternoon, the manager calls me and tells me the money is missing. That Thursday, the area manager fires me, telling me no one else had a chance to take it. I asked her to give me a lie detector test, but she said no. They did not send me my last paycheck, plus because they fired me before April 15, they are not going to send me my bonus, which was going to be between one and two thousand dollars. They are telling all the other employees that I quit. They sent an email to all the managers telling them not to write me a referral letter or anything. I found out that area manager gets to keep all the bonus money from the people she fires. They never had a problem with me before, and yet the first thing that comes up, they fire me and keep my bonus money.
On 4-14-09, I went to Jackson Hewitt to amend my taxes and add 1099 to the 1040x. I was assisted by Nikia ** who was very unprofessional who loudly and embarrassingly began talking about the IRS going to penalize me for certain things. Then she claimed to need additional information to file my 1099 forms. When I got back with the addition information, she still claimed she could not file the forms. I told Nakia the forms had already been filed electronically. All I needed her to do was to add the info to the 1040x. She still acted as if she did not understand. This began to upset me because I had to set and waste valuable time dealing with someone who refuse to do their job. I talked with the owner, Amir **, who claimed he did not know of the situation and circumstances which I spoke with him about concerning Nakia. He then tried to sweep the whole matter under the rug. Then he tried to tell me what the law is but could not produce the law for me in black and white. I told him I will let a judge determine what the law is. I am a very unsatisfied customer who has been mistreated by this unprofessional company who is supposed to be in the business of filing taxes but refuse to file taxes. Something needs to be done about this kind of nonsense.
I feel like I was robbed. I was treated so horribly by this location. On April 8, they would have charged me $224 to do my taxes. I had them put it on hold (probably cancel) because I was only getting back $200. When I went back to the store today, 04/13, to cancel, all of a sudden the $224 they would have charged me vanished, and they were going to charge me $100. My boyfriend went ahead and filed his taxes when I put mine on hold. He paid them $257, which seemed way too high. Tracy tried to tell me that they were never going to charge me $224 and that never happened when it did. So I know they purposely overcharged my boyfriend and would have charged me the $224 if I went ahead and filed when he did. They were so rude to me and treated me like dirt. I will never again go through Jackson Hewitt. Tracy was the rudest woman I have ever met in my entire life. She is absolute scum of the earth who repeatedly lied to me. She kept saying I was making that up about the $224 charge so she could cover up the fact that they were overcharging. She was trying to cover up that she overcharged my boyfriend. So I ended up paying the $50 cancellation fee, so as they were giving me my W2 forms back, one of the four pieces was missing; they lost it! So it wasn't enough that they overcharged my boyfriend and were lying to me, but they lost my W2 form with my social security number on it! I feel like I have been robbed and there is nothing I can do.
On March 10, 2009, one of your employees, a Ms. Kendra **, prepared my 2008 taxes. We all know how bad things are especially with retirees like me. When my taxes were finished, Ms. ** told me that my bill was $ 450. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. Here I am, times are bad and your employee had the nerve to charge me $450 for what was a routine tax preparation. Up until I went to your company, my tax preparations cost me no more than $125-$175. I intend, in the next several days, to send my story to the newspapers, Consumers Affairs and the Better Business Bureau. You robbed me. However, I'm going to advise as many organizations as possible to what a scam operation Jackson Hewitt Tax Service, Inc. is running. Jackson Hewitt Inc. makes it impossible to contact them personally to discuss any problems with their sites. Customer service gives out one general number, 1-973-630-1040 option 3. However the catch is, their voice mail asks for the last four letters of the person you're trying to contact. How does one know who to contact? When JH offers no voice mail contents like any reputable company would have, the truth is that JH doesn't want customers to have any personal contact to resolve his/her tax problem that cannot be resolved at a satellite office.
OK, so this is the second complaint on this place I have entered. I'm still waiting on my federal refund. I called the IRS (4/06/09) to find out what the status is and they said it is still being reviewed. I asked if it had something to do with them leaving off my tips and wages. They said if that happens, I needed to do an amendment. So I went down to Jackson Hewitt (mind you, I haven't dealt with the one who prepared my taxes since the very first day), but Nancy has been helping me supposedly. I told her what the IRS said and she said, "Why do we have to do that when it doesn't affect how much you're getting back?" Anyways, so she did it, but after telling me that the person who did my taxes before had entered youngest son's last night wrong on the earn income credit. But not to worry, it was caught before sent into the IRS. Hmm, how come you told me before when you called the IRS that it was being audited because of dependents claimed? I'm so confused. Needless to say, I asked for my money back and she told me that she was unable to do that, but could give me a break next year. Ha ha! I told her there wouldn't be a next year and I was told that "at least you're getting the amendment free." Someone please help me.
My husband and I filed our taxes for 2008 in January 2009 with Jackson and Hewitt. They deducted 1000 dollars from our federal tax return and $300 from our state tax return. We were told that it was supposed to be paying back last year's stimulus check that we received which was $1200. Then Mike said that we were going to be reimbursed. We never got the money. He showed me where it was pending on his computer, but the IRS said they issued us a check for 6209 dollars. We only received $5200. Then with the state check, we were shorted by 300 dollars. What can we do to get our money back?
We filed our 2007 taxes with Jackson Hewitt last year. It was an agonizing experience to say the least. After the greetings, all my paperwork (W2, 1098, 1099, etc.) were presented to the tax preparer. Firstly, the tax preparer, Cathy, seemed confused about the return and kept referring to a tax manual for entry. After the information was entered into the computer, we discovered that I owed close to $8000 in Federal taxes. I have never, in my life, owed anything and always have had a refund. After having her recheck her entries, there was a mistake. Cathy had not included the real estate taxes for our house. Furthermore, she kept fidgeting with the computer because the computer program would not allow her to continue. Eventually, after the 1040 was complete, I owed Federal - $1000 and had gotten a refund from MD state. In my mind, even though I owed, that was relief from the original $8000. I signed the return and made the payments and all was well. In March 2009, I received a letter from the IRS claiming that the taxes were prepared wrong and as a result, I owed $2357. I was livid and called JH to show them the paperwork from the IRS. They checked their copies and made me bring mine in, only to find out that Cathy had not entered $7900 worth of savings interest in the 1040. The bank's 1099-int was attached with the rest of the paperwork. I spoke to the manager, who after investigating the claim, agreed that it was JH's fault but they would not cover the entire liability, just the interest/ penalties. This was because I did not have the Gold Guarantee. I explained to her that the choice was not even offered at the time of the preparation. The manager said that she could believe that because some tax preparers do not push the Gold Guarantee. I asked her where that left me with my situation and I was told that the General manager would decide whether he would pick up the liability. Predictably, I have not heard anything from them and my calls go unanswered. I am seeking legal options to make them understand that this situation arose because of their negligence and they should be responsible for their actions. A person goes to Jackson Hewitt with a belief and confidence that his or her taxes will be prepared correctly and the hired tax preparer would be diligent enough to avoid such mistakes. With no fault of my own were the taxes prepared erroneously and due diligence was not followed in this establishment.
December 2008 I receive a letter from the IRS stating that there was missing information that Jackson Hewitt fell to submit on my 2007 tax return. I call the offices several times to address this issue from the IRS. I spoke to a rep name Curtis, Matt, Jessica and April for several weeks. I explained to Curtis, Matt and April about the letter's date and he advised me to call the IRS to request and extension I went to the office with my 2007, 2008 paperwork, documentation and the letter from the IRS. One rep told me that she did not have access to my 2007 return and that I needed to talk to Curtis. I took off work early on 1-28-09 to catch Curtis. Matt amended my 2007 return. Matt explained to me the process of amending a return that it had to be in the same information that it was in 2007. Once everything is verified and completed they will make all need changes to the return to submit to the IRS. My return was put on hold until Jessica approves and processes the Gold Guarantee. Jessica was out sick. Every week since that day I heard all kinds of excuses. They finally process my Golden Guarantee on 03-01-09. Then the I power plus line of credit took all of my money out of my account because, Jackson Hewitt rep took 3 months to complete my 2007 to pay back a loan that I received in November 2008. I went to the office and April handwritten on all my returns [my name] and my new address. Jessica told me that my check was sent to the wrong address on 3-13-09. Then April relayed a message to me that on 3-23-09 the check was mail from the east coast to the right name and address. The post office stated to me on 3/31/09 that [my name] was not on the box and the mail was returned. The power plus is draining me dry all they had to do was fix their mistake, send the check in the correct name and address. I have the supporting documentation. Why are they forcing me take a name that is not legally mines anymore. I need that check today! Missed time from work due to meeting with them and not having gas to get to work. Unable to support and provide for my family because they are taking money out of my account every pay. Stressful
Mr. J rushed us thru our taxes , missing alot of our information and never gave us the right deductions. Charged us alot for having out taxes done. We took our taxes to H&R Block for a second look and found out that we are due back muck more then Mr. J had figured. Like 5 times as much coming back to us.
A little over a month ago I went to Jackson Hewitt on Flatbush Ave in brooklyn to get my taxes done. I spoke to a gentleman named Patrick. He later informed me there were a few things i was missing and I would go in later to fix it. A few weeks later I got a call from a manager at Jackson Hewitt named Roland who said that he was Patrick's manger and that Patrick had went out of town and that he needed some information that could be filled out over the phone. I advised him that I didnt want to do anything over the phone and I wanted to go back in and get it taken care of. The manager said ok and we hung up. After much thought and advise from a friend. I decided to go somewhere else because things were taking too long to get done so I went to Liberty, we went over everything and they subitted my taxes the same day. I was informed a day or two later that it was rejected because I had already filed. I was very upset so I called Jackson Hewett and they advised me that they had sent it in the day or two after i told them not to without me being there. The manager who I advised not to send in my forms had sent them in. I went in to the tax place and the manger told me he was sorry but he didnt know he thought it would be ok if he figured out the problem himself and fixed it. The amount I was getting back when done at Libert was more than what I was getting at Jackson Hewitt. The fee they were charging me was also less. I had to leave work early so that I could go back to the same Jackson Hewitt and try to find out why and how this could have happened. This made me lose hours at work and as an end result may not hit goal because of it. Causing me to possibly lose my bonus check. In the past I have had problems where I have had to be interviewed by the irs because someone stole my information and tried to claim me when my mother had already done it. These are things I dont want to have to go through again.
On February 12,2009,I went to Jackson Hewitt and paid Jackson Hewitt 60 dollars for an amended tax return.They had told me it would take about 6-8 wks until I got my amended return.They got everything ready and put everything in the envelope and handed it to me,the guy who was doing my taxes seem very new he had to call the manager over to help him fill in all the info in the computer.It did make me nervous but I figured the manager was looking over it that it would me fine,so I sealed the envelope with all the info in it as the manager and the tax preparer watched me,than the manager gave me the address and I put it right on the envelope while he was telling me,I went straight to the post office and mailed it. On March 25,2009 I got a letter in the mail saying the w2's were never sent with them,I was in shock,I went directly to that same Jackson Hewitt and explained it,the manager did admit to the mistake and refunded the 60 dollars back,I HAD ASKED HIM IF THEY CAN FRONT ME THE MONEY SOMEHOW HE SAID NO,He made no apologies at all even tho he admitted it was their mistake.I called the IRS and asked them how long it would take for my money because the mistake was made by Jackson Hewitt,they said it didnt matter it could take 8-12 more weeks from the time they received it. Me and my two kids are really hurting,I have no transportation,no job,barely any food,Ive been selling almost everything out of my house to just buy food.That money is to get a car so I can go back to work,Weve been taking the city bus,I DONT HAVE EVEN ANY MONEY NOW FOR THE BUS,ALL MY BILLS ARE DUE,I really dont know what to do all because I trusted a tax preparer to know what to do,I def would of thought they would of put my W2's with it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!They just seem like they dont really care,their messing with peoples lives,people need their money.
we had almost 600.00 deducted from our fedral refund that stated it was for filling fees. both my husband and i were wondering why it was so much so we went to the office and were told it was for last years fees along with this years fees. we understand that fees would be taken out for them filling our taxes but not that much. we were told that the office would check into why it was so much and all we kept getting was blank answers.I was also told at one point that the amount that was shown on my reciept was not the amount that was taken but after adding up all the numbers and subtracting that from the amount of the check it was right. we have been going back and forth with this issue for 2 months now and still nothing has been done. the last time i had spoke with an employee there i was told the bank did not charge me the amount that i am protesting. i would like to get this resolved. i am no way trying to get out of paying for what is owed but i know i should have not been charged 300.00 per year for services i did not recieve.
I always file my tax at 2418 waco dr, last year i claim my niece and sister and received a letter from IRS. I took the papers to her office and she look it and said it was nothing she can do about becasuse i din't got the gold guaranty. then i ask her to call my tax preparer (may) she inform me da she wasn't working for the company and it was no way for her to contact her. I left the office mad and call back days latter. This year i file my tax at dif. location (next door) and when i went to pick my check i found out da may still working for the company and Barbara lie to me. i been talking to some friends and the same thing happen to them, they always said da she's out of the office or she is gone, don't they know da they can force us to file with them if what we want is our preparer do it!!! they really need to get Barbara another job. she is a bad customer service!
I filed my taxes with Jackson Hewit on Benning Road in February, returning customer. I was I would be given a call when the money came in. I received a call around the end of February to come in and pick up my check. As it turned out this was my state refund. Jackson Hewitt had taken the preparation charge ($382.95) out of the refund. When I saw the check for a little over $100 I told the preparor that I could have waited for the larger federal check. I signed for the state check and left. One month later I called to see where my federal check was and I was told someone would call me back. As it turned out, my check had been delivered to the location, not signed in and was stolen, signed and cashed, cleared by the bank around March 4th. I spoke with Jackson Hewitt on March 21 to inquire about my refund and how come I had not received it. I was then told the check had been cashed. I told them I had not received the check and had not been informed to come in because the check was at the Benning Road location. They understood and informed me that they knew I had not come in for the check, I was one of approximately 3 customers whose checks were stolen from within, signed and cashed, I contacted the owner - E Joiner, his secretary said he was not in. She explained that she was waiting on a copy of the check from the Santa Monica Bank and upon receipt, she would send a copy to the Benning Road facility. I would then have to come in and sign my name 5 times, produce identification (driver's license and social security card), which I did on March 25th. When I first called Mr Joiner's office to speak with him, his secretary Denise said that he was not available and that I should call back after 1pm. I called back and he would speak with me for whatever reason and used his secretary to relay the instructions. She said I would also need to get a police report. After giving my handwriting I went to the Police Department near my home to obtain a report. The officer said why don't they just reissue you a check. The report was submitted as identity theft. This should be fraud and more. I would not receive a report immediately, a detective would be in contact with me concerning the check fraud. I phoned EJ Joiner's office while in the police station and spoke to Denise again. I was very professional, never yelled or anything. I asked her why was I having to go through all of this? I am the customer and if you have an internal problem, Joiner should be speaking with me. I told her I was contacting IRS, the police, 7 on your Side (TV Station) and anyone I that I needed to. I told her IRS needed a copy of the police report. She asked me why did IRS need a police report. I told her that I would be sending IRS all documents. On the previous phone call I told Denise I wanted my tax preparation fee returned, she had said she needed to speak with Mr Joiner, when we spoke again she said she was writing out the check for the fee and did I want the check to be sent to the Benning Road office, I told her no, send it to my home. What is so alarming, because no one had any answers, I did my own investigation. There was a flyer that I have a copy of that was located at the Benning Road facility. I intend to turn a copy of everything over to the detective when I receive a call. The flyer advertised, We Do Cash Tax Refund Checks - Power Check Cashing. My federal refund check was signed, using the last 4 digits of my social security number, the first 3 numbers were no where near mine. The point is the check was deposited at 4 Power LLC. Two employees from the Benning Road office had been terminated. I'm not sure what for. I'm not saying they had anything to do with my check, but something is wrong. The facilty on South Capitol Street has been plagued with the same problem. I intend to seek further direction from any and all. I did not sign for my federal refund which was $2634.05, I'm in need of the funds and cannot believe Jackson Hewitt would make me do all the work for a problem they are having internally. Emotionally I am very uneasy with someone having access to my correct social security number, home address etc. I did not receive the check and I am very alarmed at the non-challant way of this being handled.
I've done my taxes with a local Jackson Hewitt for three years now. I recently did my taxes with them and wish I had not. The young lady who did my taxes charged me an arm and a leg to end up messing up my taxes all together. She missed a few steps and they needed to do an amendment tax report which I ended up having to mail myself. After that I received a letter from the NYSDT&F saying that they had to adjusted another mistake that was done. I went to the Jackson Hewitt office and the three employees there seem to not know what they were doing what so ever. The lady asked me for my social security number about 15 times then started to write it on a piece of scrap paper and when I told her not to she gave me attitude. I will never go back there ever! And will tell all my friends and family the same..... It has been a month now waiting for my tax return. I spoke to someone at the number provided for tax information and they said it will be about anther month before I see anything. SUCKS
Feb 16th i called jackson hewitt tax service. a male rep took my call i requested an appointment to have our taxes done, he gave me two names juanisha and jessica -manager to schedule an appointment. oh when he said manager jessica i informed him please make the appointment with jessica. he made the appointment for feb 17th at 11am. this was to be a basic guarantee tax preparation. we had all our regired documents together. jessica did not know what she was doing! after 3 long hours jessica informed us that we owed the federal $1521.00 and would receive $3357.00 from state. we wanted the state refund deposited to our checking. we signed the required documents.the charge for the tax service was $286.00 we gave cash and left with an ugly gut feeling. on march 17th i went to the IRS state refund WEBSITE to check the status of our refund. the message was that we had not yet filed our state taxes. i called 1-800- i spoke with goodwin. he informed me that the message was correct, i needed to call the office where i had the taxes prepared. i called 559 talked to vanessa she said she would call that office and have someone call me. i waited 2-hours no call back. i called again this time i talked to crystal, i expressed my concern to her and that i needed help. she put on hold and called the office where i had our taxes done. she advice me to please go to the office and talk to juanisha. we went back to the office with tax paper work that jessica had prepared. what happened is that jessica never mailed out the state tax forms only the federal. that took another 3-hours to let us know of the unprofessional service we had been charged $286.00 dollars .here my husband and i were waiting for our state refund so that we could pay our federal tax bill for $1521.00. what stress it caused both my hisband and i. juanisha was not abel to help us. she informed us that on 3/18/09 a manager from another office would call for an appointment. on 3/18/09 manager a. arregin called at 10am and we scheduled an appointment with her that same day at 11am. we had to have our taxes amended which took 5 hours. jessica had put info about our income that was incorrect to many errors to mention. we would not be owing $1521.00 to the federal only $156.00 and our state refund would not be $3357.00 we would received $1602.00 from the state. we want our $286.00 dollars that we paid. also jessica was not a manager i was given false info. it was her first year. alot of stress for both my husband and I and if i would not have called to find out about our state refund we would have been late paying our federal and charged late charges.
I went to J.H. for many years. I have been audited by the IRS for tax year 2004.When I was first contacted by the IRS (2007)I contacted JH and brought them the letter and was asked for supportive documentation. I provided the information requested. A year went by and after a while I just thought everything was taken care of. Then January 2009 I was again contacted by the IRS in a letter of collection. So I contacted JH again, and was told that my case or my file or... had been closed. It was closed and my documentation lost or destroyed with out contacting me or the IRS. Now the Irs wants their money. And L. Crist has refused to help me or back up the Gold Gaurantee that I purchased. This has went on for well over a year now and I want the gold gaurantee to pay the irs the total amount of approximately $2,600. I will be picketting the Ottawa locations untill this issue is resolved. I am currently laid off and have plenty of time to lawfully pickett as many JH locations as me and my associates so desire. As of March 18, 2009 the IRS has had Only One correspondence from JH and that was on appx. Feb.21 2009 There have been many un returned phone calls and Ihave even been hung up on buy these people insistant on not holding up their end of the bargain My Bank accounts would have been wiped out by the irs if I hadn't interveened. and the interest and penalties keep adding up.
On Febuary 02 2009 my husband and myself prepared our taxes at our local Jackson Hewitt. We were denied the instant refund, which was fine, however they said it would take up to 8-15 days. we were supposed to be getting back 5,767.00 but due to Jackson Hewitt's error the IRS delayed our refund and we recieved it 20 days later for a much smaller amount. Jackson Hewitt also put our State refund with our Federal refund electronically without our knowledge. The damage that this reulted in was extreme. Due to the economic status we were counting on our State refund to pay off our bills because the federal went to getting cars so that we could be able to keep our jobs. This miscalculation in funds set us back even including our rent. they need to be held accountable for their actions this is peoples lives that were playing with and in these times we all cannot afford that. Thank You

Jackson Hewitt I have tried numerous times to get someone to help with an issue I have with my taxes that were done by Jackson Hewitt. I had my taxes prepared at JH, in 2007 for my 2006 tax return. Well last year, I was notified from the IRS that I owe money back not due to filing my taxes paying the government back, but a mistake by Jackson Hewitt, where they put in the wrong income earned than the form I gave the preparer. I have never in all my years of getting my taxes filed had any tax preparer make up numbers, change to get more back nothing, this was an error by Jackson Hewitt. I sent my information with my return back to the IRS disputing this over 3700 payment they claim I now owe, because Jackson Hewitt put an amount that was lower than my actual salary amount. I was counting on my income tax return in full that was filed for 2008, to save my home from foreclosure. I wrote and faxed over a third appeal due to hardship to the IRS, that while under dispute not to take my Federal Tax return because of that, while I am trying to get Jackson Hewitt to be held accountable for their mistake. It looks as though now that my return was taken and I am at a loss, my home will have to go for foreclosure, I am behind 3 months do to job loss, and now working as a temp making 55,000.00 less than what I made prior to my unemployment last year. I was not notified by mail from the IRS that they declined my 3rd request, I can not get no one from Jackson Hewitt to fix there mistake and be accountable for paying for there error, I am looking to be put out on the street by the end of this month because of this and I do not know what to do. I have just found out that the IRS has taken 4174.89 from my return leaving me with less than 20% of my return, which now I can not pay back my back mortgage and my house is going to go into forclosure, that refund was all I had to keep my home, and for a mistake by Jackson Hewitt in 07, I am paying for it in 09.
I filed my 2008 federal income taxe. they put my money on the ipower card. I took almost all my money off except for several hunderds of dollars. I lost the card,I reported the card lost. Its been (6)sixs weeks no card has been sent to me. I call meta bank where the card was issue they told me there was nothing i can do, i call Jackson hewitt they said was nothing i can do. they can not keep my money. Please i need some type of help getting my money Back. I'm just so frustrated about the whole situation. I have bills to pay.
.On 1/24/2009 we went to jackson hewitt at walmart to file our taxes,we also filed for a money now loan, was turned down was given no reason why.We went with the ipowercard and was told there would be NO CHARGE that was the first lie.Then once the money was transfered from the bank to the card we were told the card was no good went back to agent as we were told to do, he told the card was good this went on for another 10 days.We did get our return finially, NOW we recently got notice from the IRS that there has been another error on this return.Was charged 297.00 for prep fees also 30.95 for acct set up fee. Was also cut short 40.00 on my card and givin no reason why. We would like to know why companys like thisone can promise,guarantee, to get your business then not stand behind there promises.This should be againest the law and THEY SHOULD BE HELD RESPOUNSBLE FOR ALL ERRORS.this will be the last time we will EVER use jackson hewitt and by all the complants on line this has been going on everwhere. someone needs to do somthing about this.they did not do there job right and is at fault, we feel that the money paid for there serviceshould be refunded.

I filed my tax return on January 31,2009 and I have alreay receieved my state but on the other hand where is my Federal. I was suppose to recieve it on Feb 13th then supposedly it was pushed back by the IRS. Was told I would recieve a letter in the mail. I tried to call IRS to find out what it was going on and they told me that couldn't tell me. So now I am back to square one. The IRS has said they deposited my money in the bank which would be republic bank feb 27th. I then called nancy from jackson hewitt (which she has been going through this with me the whole entire time and has been very helpful thank you nancy) and she has told me again they haven't recieved anything all I want to know where is my money? My husband, kids and I are looking for a house my mom and dad have given us a dead line to get out and I'm not able to pay a deposit or anything until we recieve this money. I have a car payment and other bills that are going to be behind if I don't recieve it by this Thursday
I went to JH, to get my tax done. I did get my money. But now I am getting a letter from the I.R.S. saying they were done wrong!
My daughter and son-in-law had their taxes prepared here this year and they charged them over $400. This was for a short form! Absolutely ridiculous! The poor things, my son-in-law lost his job and has been without any income for a month and then they charge this horrible amount! Something needs to be done about their rates!
I have been an employee for four years through two owners. Two weeks ago our imediate supervisor resigned abruptly. So our office had to deal dirrectly with the owners. On the Monday following my supervisors leaving, the owner came to our office and told myself and my manager what a wonderful job we were doing and how our office was running well. M. his wife approached my manager while she was with a customer and told her move I need that computer and my manager said let me put this return on hold and my customer and I will move to another computer, M. said just get out of the chair now I need the computer do you not understand. The entire time our customer was in the office m. told us that we could do better with our customer service and she was embarrised by our service. Not once except by myself and my manager was anything said to the customer to accomadate him on the dalay. We were embarrased and belittled and ridiculed infront of three customers that day. Our only responce was yes mam. Then the next day M. the owner called me on my way home which is a 45min drive and she belitted me and explained that on my 12-14 hr days that I took no lunch and she was going to dock my pay for 30min of all my time since november, even though my time on the computer proves I was working the whole time but small intervals between clients. My pay comes this friday so we will see if that is so. Well then she told me that my hours were cut from 68 to 26.5 a wk. Then this monday when I came to clock in my owners were at my office again and explained I was being let go because she didn't like any of us and they were putting in new computers for the office and she told me that we were all [expletive] and we needed to leave and refused to let us have our customer copys of our own returns that we had in our personal files. M. told me she did not have to give me a reason for my dismisal, I said please give me one and she said I cost them money giving two 25$ discounts to two customers recieving a low return to keep the customer. heck one of them only got 3$ back on there fedral return. She also said that my bonus was excessive and she was letting me go so that I did not recieve another penny from her company, and G. said how are we supposed to pay the rent if you give discounts like this. Now keep in mind not once in 3yrs have we had contact or met these two individuals until last wk. I am beside my self. I didn't no what else to do or who would listen but thank you. I am without a job they are fighting my unemployment and I am not recieving my bonus that I have worked so hard for and deserve.
I feild my taxs with them. They charge me 450.00 just to file them. Then the IRS wrote a letter stating that they made mistakes on my takes. When I ask them to refund my money that I payed them to prepared them they told me no and said they did not make any mistake and I had the letter to show them that they made the mistake. The manger yell at me and said were not giving back any money to you to prepare your taxs and told he dont give a [expletive] if I came back next year or not and hand up the phone
I recieved a money now loan from jackson hewitt which came from Santa Barbra Bank and was suppose to be paid back when i recieved my tax return. But just so happen when the stimulus check came out the money for the christmas loan was taken out of that from a different back I spoke with the manager on the phone she stated she would call me back in 15 mins but she never did to go over my taxes. I recieved a call stating that i had money when was going to pay my light bill and only had half
I have been going to jackson hewitt for 10 yrs now. I have always got my money the next day.This year they said that i was denied of my one loan. They charge me all these fees and i had to wait for 15 days to get my money.At first they said that i could not get ipower card that i would a check the next day.I call to see if my check was here they said it was denied so in those 15 days it was put on the card instead. When my money was on the card i went to the bank to get all the money off it i was charge 1.5% to get my money.I payed all them fees and turn around and had to pay more to get the rest of my money.I think this is a rip off to charge me all these fee and do not get any of the fees back. Waiting on my money to pay my bills,because i lost my job and needed the money to pay them.
We went into the Jackson Hewitt office locally to get our Federal tax prepared. The first woman had no idea what she was doing or how to input information into the computer. She kept asking us the same questions over and over.She also kept apologizing saying that sorry, I am new to this. She kept having to call her supervisor over to help her. Finally after about 45 minutes, I asked if she could have her supervisor do our taxes since we had gotten very little accomplished during that time. Her supervisor, Shirley came over and completed our taxes. She asked how we wanted to receive our refund and we told her by direct deposit into our checking account. She took the bank routing number and the account number and we wrote her a check for our fee in the amount of $300. We were rtold that our money would be in our account on either Feb 14th or 24th. Today I went online to track my refund and after completing the form asking for your SSN and amount of refund, it took me to a page that said the IRS had found a mistake of $300 ( thankfully to our advantage) and that our check would be MAILED by Feb 28th. So I called IRS and spoke with a rep who told us that they had recieved our filing on Feb 3rd but no where did Jackson Hewitt submit our bank info for a direct deposit, that is why they are mailing our check. He did tell me that Jackson Hewitt checked the box indicating that we wanted direct deposit but they didn't include the necessary info for that to take place. I called our local office and after getting a fast busy signal for an hour, I looked up the number in the phone book and got a different number, which is a customer service number. After I explained what happened, she said there is no other phone number to that office but that she would send Shirley an email asking her to call me. In about an hour Shirley did call and I explained again to her that according to IRS she had not entered our bank information in order to get our money through direct deposit. Her response was, well, IRS makes mistakes all the time, over paying people. I said that hs nothing to do with THIS issue. She did admit that when they electronibally filed our paperwork some of the info had been lost. My question is... why didn't you call us then? So now we have another two plus weeks to wait before we are able to get the money that should have been in our account this Tuesday! I will NEVER go back to those incompetent people at JACKSON HEWITT and I told her so when she never even apologized for the mistake. Today, people need their refund money and if Jackson Hewitt can't manage to train them properly, no one should put their trust in them. I certainly won't ever again. As a result of the delay now, I have two bills that would have been paid on time that will now be late thanks to Jackson Hewitt abd their highly trained professionals that don't even know how to enter information into a computer!
11-15-08 My wife and i went to apply fpr a advance loan and denied.One month later we discovered our informationwas used to receive a money card by the tax preparer.When we spoke to the manger they insisted Alicia would repay the monet but as of 2-04-2009 that loan is still open .The company wantted us to sign papers and would do our taxes for free but we declined because we didnt have legal representation and dont understand legal terms.We have filed police reports,contacted head quarters and no return phonecalls. During the month of December15-2009,we borrowed 300.00 the same 300.00we applied for.W e borrowed the money to help with bills.However the loan we received from our aunt came late.Our phone was disconnected,rent was late and had to pay additional fees and deposits.Also,it has taken many hours and time to contact lawyers and research and different divisions that handle complaints.
I did my taxes with Jackson Hewitt on January 30,2009 and i my taxes put on an I-Power card which I received my taxes the next day on the 31st. I tried to pay my T-Mobile cell phone bill with the pre-paid card. The rep from T-mobile said my payment didn't go through so i told her it was money on the card. Well she tried it a second time to be sure she had the right information. So again the payment didn't go through again. Well Jackson Hewitt froze my money. They been having me calling T-Mobile for a letter from a manager and running back and forth to T-Mobile stores for a letter which T-Mobile does not do. My money has been frozen since January 31st. Jackson Hewitt customer service on the I-Power card are so Rude and when asking to speak to a manager or supervisor they hang up on you. The amount of money is $322.70 that they are saying I have to wait until T-Mobile accept the payment. I had to pay my bill with a debit card through my bank and the rest in cash at the T-Mobile store.
So I went to JH to do my taxes, and paid extra for the RAL( 1day loan). After a couple of days I call and they tell me the irs had rejected my return due to a mistake made by the preparer. Once it was fixed a couple more days goes by and I still don't have my money. They tell me I was denied for yet more mistakes made by the preparer. Now it is three weeks later and I still have no money. I called the IRS and they said there were yet more mistakes and my return would be less then excpected. I had purchesed this so called gold guerentee and they still won't give me my money.
On January 29, 2009 I went to the Jackson Hewitt in the Wal-Mart on 2555 W. Apache Trail. This is my 8th and last year using Jackson Hewitt. I had my taxes prepared on January 29, 2009, for the 2008 tax year. They filed my Federal returns with e-file. The gentleman told me I would have the money from Federal and State would be deposited into my account within 8-15 days. My state was deposited on Feb. 11, 2009. As of Feb. 18, my Federal still has not been deposited, so I decided to go onto the Santa Barbara & Trust website to track my refund. The website said that my Federal return came into their bank on Feb. 13, 2009. The website also said that quote, We have authorized a check disbursement to you in the amount of $2,989.05. Please allow up to 24 hours for the check print authorization to be processed by your transmitter and tax preparer. Once the check record has been processed, your tax preparer will make the check available to you.. So I decided to call Jackson Hewitt at the number I was given, which is, 480-924-6600. After recieving a recording after several tries, I finally had an actual person answer by the name Chris that claimed to be the manager. I was told after Chris finally figured out the problem, that the account information for the direct deposit was wrong. How could this be, the state was deposited with no problems, and I looked at the account for the federal was the exact same. So with that said, when I talked to Jackson Hewitt and they told me they had no idea where my money was, I told them that the money was funded to them from the Santa Barbara bank. So after quite a few attempts, they called me back and said they had my money, which they DID have it for 4 days. Needless to say, I will NEVER, use, and I mean N-E-V-E-R use them again, especially when they charge $300.00 and not know where my money is. And all Chris could say is, I am sorry, I dont know what happened. My suggestion to Chris for when the next time this happens is...FIND OUT, not when it is good for you, NOW, I am the customer, remember the value of the Customer is ALWAYS right, this time I was. Thanks for NOTHING, Jackson Hewitt. My house Payment was supposed to be paid when my money arrived 5 days ago, now I am fighting with the mortgage company so I dont loose my house.
I went to have my taxes filed electronically because my daughter needed money for her child. Iusually always do my own taxes because I work in accounting. I filed on 2/6/09 and have yet to get my refund and today is 2/18/09. I already had my form filled out thinking it would be cheaper and I know it was correct! she said that I was off by $5.00 so I could not get the lower rate. My refund due me was $1163.00 but she charged me $190.95! I expected my check to be deposited to my account after the 8 days as promised, therefore, my checking account is overdrawn with 2 overdraft charges for the first time causing a hardship to me & my family!
We got one of those holiday loans in November for 300.00(received a lot less). Then we got $230.36 in January vbefire we got our W-2's. When I took our W-2's in at the end of January, we got our refund. Evene after all the fees were taken out, the amount that went on the card was several hundred dollars less than what the IRS said. We are still owed $242.41 and when the money went on the card 2/12/09, they took it right back off. I think we are owed that money and no one wants to tell me anything. Thanks for not giving us all of our money. We will go to H & R Block next year. Our family is barely surving as it is. We are just like eveyone else. My husband has applied for disability. I have a child that is handicapped. There are three other children that live here.
On February 2, 2009 I got my taxes prepared at Jackson Hewitt. The owner of this Jackson Hewitt did my tax preperation and rushed through the entire thing. He made lots of spelling and numerical errors when filling out my return, which I had to repeatedly correct him on. At one point, when filling out my homestead form, after correcting him so many times on the spelling of my landlord's name, he told me "it didn't matter". Near the end of the preperation, he asked me if I recived a stimulus alst year, in which I replied yes, but since I had a child in 2008 I was eligible for the rebate recovery. He told me this had nothing to do with them and the IRS issued a seperate check for it. I decided to get an assisted refund deposited onto an I-Power card in 8-15 days. Johnny told me I should recieve my refund on Friday 13, 2009. When Friday the 13th came around, the balance on my card was still 0. I didn't make a big deal about it because I called the IRS and also Jackson Hewitt and they told me to give it until Feb. 20th. However, when I asked the IRS about my rebate recovery credit, they told me they DO NOT issue seperate checks or release seperate funds for this credit and it should have been claimed on my tax return so that it would be added to my tax refund. I looked over my tax refund and did not see a credit for this at all. My federal refund was the sum of my EIC, additional child tax credit, and federal taxes paid. No more, no less. I called Jackson Hewitt to ask them about it, but they still insist the government will be sending me those additional funds on a later date. I hate when people insult my inteligence by blatant lying, so I read verbatim, what the IRS stated on their website about the recovery rebate. Then, the lady on the phone had the nerve to tell me I didn't know what I was talking about, and what I was reading was her was from the stimulus bill for 2009. I reread it to her again, but she insisted I was wrong, and she finally hung up on me. Now the IRS is saying my refund is on hold because the credit for my rebate recovery was incorrect on my return. It's February 17, 2008 and I still have not recieved anything. I am going to give it until February 20, 2009 before I let Jackson Hewitt see my nasty side. I should have known better than to deal with them. The year before they didn't send out my state and homestead forms until almost 6 weeks after I had my taxes done... which was supposed to be E-FIle. When I asked them why they had not sent it out, they told me it was my responsiblity, but they would do it for me "this time". All I can say is they have terrible, awful, horrible, very bad customer service. I hope they didn't mess me up too bad this year. Did anyone else have a problem with them in regards to the recovery rebate?
i went and filed my taxes at the local j&h office on january 27th, on january 28th darlene told me that they had to remove my stimulus credit amount from my refund in order to process it and that my refund amount would be available on feb 6th, on feb 6th my direct deposit wasnt there, i called the irs told them my situation and they told my J&H had no right to remove that amount from my refund and my direct deposit would come thru on feb 10th, well little to say the 10th still no money i called the irs and they told me there was mathematical errors on JH part so my taxes would be delayed and i would recive them on the 17th, on the 12th i get a call from JH and they said my check was there, what wait a check that shouldnt be i had direct deposit they oh well it came check well i wonder why another screw up on there part. i had a hard time cashing my check and io asked JH if they could cash it seeing that they screwed it up, i was told no,, big surprise,,,,and to top it off i still had to pay the bank fees to have my taxes prepared for 2 weeks!! $135 i lost bc of there ignorance,,,,i am telling everyone from lockport dont go there
The preparer did not provide the proper time that was promised also the lie to return fees for preparing the taxes incorrect
I got my taxes done this year for the first time with Jackson Hewitt. What a big mistake. I always used H & R Block but this year there was a Jackson Hewitt office by my house so I thought I would try them. The people who working had no class. They just rushed me into getting my taxes done and rushed me out. When I left there my stupid iPower card wouldn't activate, they said it would by the end of the day. I had spent all day trying to make it work. Nothing. Finally I called the main Jackson Hewitt line. waited on hold forever and spoke with a real person and got another number. I had to wait on hold for 27 mins. Finally I get the card activated and 3 days later my money is on there. Even though I spent extra money on the 1 day money back bullshit. So in this conversation they give me a district manager named J.Hooker. I left two messages with her without a call back ever. I called Jackson Hewitt office where I got my taxed done and told them I had a second look from H&R Block and they skipped me out on 900.00. They yelled at me and told me I can go to h&r block all I want, they didn't care. After all the nonsense, I left messages and so on. Basically it comes down to this, They always over advertise how great they are and they aren't. False advertisement to the fullest. I will never have M. Gulley from Stockton, California do my taxes ever again. Thanks Jackson Hewitt for nothing.
I went and filed my taxes on February 5, 2009. I have been filing with this company for the past 6 years. It took them 3 hours for them to file my return. They told me I was approved for te RAL and it will be on my ipower card within 24 hours. After 24 hours it was not on my card, so I called them back and they told me it was denied and they gave me the bank number. I can Santa Barbara bank and they told me it was denied because I applied for the stimulous tax rebate, but I did not. When I was filing my taxes they asked me if I received the stimulous tax rebate and I told them yes I received $600.00. Then the bank told me my refund should be on my card by Friday, February 13, 2009. As of today I still have not received my refund. I will never ever file with the company again. I had planned on paying off my daughter's college bill so she can transfer to another college.
I filed with Jackson Hewitt on 1/16/09 with my last paycheck stub. I have used there service for the past 9 years. On this date they insisted i take the fund on the i power card which after fees came to 413.00. i knew then something wasnt correct. my usual first check is well over a 1000.00. then i go back with my w2 four days later. i am denied the ral the next day. i then get a date that it will be here 1/29/,2/6, 2/13 and now the next date is 2/24. friday i call irs. the tell me there was a mistake on my taxes. its in the resoultion dept. i call jackson hewitt to see if we could go over the returns so i could get a more clearer picture of what was going on. now they dont have time for me. they surley had time after charging me 449.00. my landlord gave me till yesterday to have his money for the month of feb at 4 pm. so thanks to them looks like i will be looking for a new place to live with my family. i now feel that i will never recieve my return.
I filed my taxes on January 25, 2009 at a local office located at 999 Broadway, Buffalo, NY 14212, Phone (716) 895-6436. I was given an ipower card and told to check for the balance due on February 6, 2009. I did check, a balance was deposited but it was $1,500 less than what was expected. I called the Broadway office on Saturday, February 14th and inquired about the difference. I spoke to the preparer who put the lady manager on the phone who told me that the difference was being held by the federal government because of money that I owed which was only $570. She was really nasty when I asked if a mistake had been made would I get reimbursed because I purchased a gold guarantee. She refused to acknowledge that there was a mistake, was very rude so I ended the conversation. I called the northtown office seeking a resolution, he spoke with me and called the broadway office to get exact numbers. He seemed very nice at first, and assured me that he would call me back. He did, and told me that there was no mistake and that the missing $1500 was from the stimulus check that I had already received in 2008. According to Charles, the computer did it automatically and it should've been explained to me. He told me to look at line 71 and I would see it, and offered to print me out a copy. Things, still didn't add up. Why would monies that I have already received be included in monies owed. So looked up recovery rebate online and found that it was a tax credit put down for people that did not receive a stimulus check for whatever reason. SO I called Charles back, told him what I found out and was told not to read too much into it. I told him that it didn't match up with what he told me still, he got very upset and rude, still refusing to acknowledge the mistake. I asked to speak to someone who could help me, he told me to call back Monday and speak to Cathy. I said if she can't help me then I will speak to someone in the corporate office who could because based on the gold guarantee, if a mistake is made Jackson Hewitt is liable up to $5,000. Jackson Hewitt is refusing to acknowledge the mistake and pay me what is due based on the contract set forth from the company. I feel very upset that I was not treated with respect and pushed aside by not just the preparers office but another head office. All I want is what was promised to me.
I had first decided to prepare my taxes online with TurboTax.com. my wife and I would be filing joint, with a dependant for the first time. So I went to TurboTax.com and followed all of the instructions. TurboTax.com said our federal refund would be $5,795.00. I was a little unsure about this amount, so I decided that we would go to Jackson Hewitt to have our taxes prepared. My wife and I filed our taxes on Feb. 3, 2009. Jackson Hewitt says we are going to receive $5,495.00 Funny how one place says I am going to get 300 less than what I thought. We were told that we had an option of having the IRS direct deposit our return into our account in 8-15 days; or do an AR, and the bank would direct deposit our refund in 8-15 days. I could have sworn I said use the IRS direct deposit option. No matter, either way it is going to take 8-15 days for our funds to be direct deposited into our account. However, the lady who prepared our taxes told us that we would be getting our refund on Friday, February 13, 2009. No refund as of yet and it is 12:03 am on Feb. 14. I then checked the customer copy of the paperwork one more time. The paperwork says that we will receive our direct deposit refund on Feb. 20, 2009. So i went to IRS.Gov, and entered all the information asked to track the status of my refund. According to the IRS,We have received your tax return and it is being processed. Unless we find mistakes or you owe other taxes, you should receive your refund by February 24, 2009. So who do I need to believe here? Jackson Hewitt says no later than Feb. 20, 2009. The IRS says 4 days after that. If I am screwed on my taxes this year, I will use TurboTax.com from now on. Not saying that Jackson Hewitt isn't good, but it is not worth the 300 in fees we had to pay, or the other 300 that we were shorted. My Wife has 2 accounts she is paying on, which are unfortunately in collection status. We were both out of work for some time and we got behind on bills. If we miss the payment dates of the 17th and the 20th, she is going to be sued. THANKS JACKSON HEWITT
I had my taxes filed on 1/30/2009 at the Hazel Crest Jackson Hewitt office. After requesting a RAL and my taxes were done I was told that my tax refund would be 3972.00 and my state would be 972.00. But I was not told the cost of filing. I was not told at all about having to pay a seperate fee for filing of state taxes. I was charged 569.00 for filing of federal taxes, a tax refund account handling fee paid to SBBT(Santa Barbara Bank and Trust) 8.00 additional products or services purchased from JH Tax Preparer, another 99.30 to SBBT for bank fees,and 63.00 for state tax preparation. The state taxes were (as I found out later) were supposed to an assisted refund.The state taxes were supposed to come back to the office, now I find out that they have to go to the bank first and then to the office. I still have not gotten my state taxes as of yet and it has been 2 weeks now. And why would they have to go to the bank when I was told that they would come to the office? I have had almost 800.00 come out of my refund. No one told me that the fees did not cover the preparation of my state taxes and that there was an additional fee for state taxes. I have been ripped off.
I went to Jackson Hewitt to file my taxes. I paid nearly $200 for bogus services. Last year I was suppose to receive the stimulus check but made a mistake by filing as dependent. I had to do an amendment and because of that I was told by the IRS that I would receive it with next years taxes. So when I went to Jackson Hewitt I told them the situation and the manager told me that I would get the $473 that I was supposed to get last year. Everything was going fine until the tax preparer started telling me how much I would receive. In the beginning she said I would get back around $1,300. Then she broke it down and told me that my federal return was $686 and my state was $193. When I noticed this did not add up I asked why? The manager came over and about 10 minutes went by while she tried to figure out the problem. This is when I knew I made a mistake by coming to this tax company. Finally she told me that the remaining sum was the $473 stimulus check and that it would be mailed directly to my house. I choose the RAL for my federal and the AR for my state and stimulus checks. I was told I would receive the federal check no later than Saturday which was 3 days later. Needless to say I did not receive the check when they said I would. It took over week for my check. Then a few days later I went to their office to inform them that I was moving out of state I wanted to request that they mail my state refund to my new address. The manager said it was not a problem, all I needed to do was write them a statement saying that I gave them permission to do so and give them the new address. So I waited for two weeks (which was the 8-15 days it would take for the AR) and still no check. So I called the office and they told me that the check will be mailed as soon as the office receives it. So I waited some more and still no check. I called back and asked where is my money and nobody could answer my question. Finally I spoke with the regional manager and told me that my state and stimulus checks were mailed to me on 1/30/09, which was two weeks ago. Come to find out they mailed it to the old address which I specifically told them not to. The checks were returned to them and they said they would mail them out immediately. Again I stressed that they need to mail it to my new address. This was on 2/09/09 and it is now 2/13/09 and I have not received them. I am starting to wonder that they have mailed it to the wrong address again. I hope that this does not happen to anyone else but I know far worse things are going to happen if you you this company. They are not tax professionals as advertised. You are better off filing them yourself!

I am starting to wonder that they have mailed it to the wrong address again. I hope that this does not happen to anyone else but I know far worse things are going to happen if you you this company. They are not tax professionals as advertised. You are better off filing them yourself!
I walked into the Jackson Hewitt located in the Source Mall in Westbury,NY on Old Country Rd. and asked Darby who was the only one there in the office who also turned out to be the office manager for that location. I asked her how much do you charge to do taxes,she said we start off at $100 w/$50 off.She never stated to me that they offer free estimates to do your taxes. She asked me for my W2's which I only had one because I had been disabled for almost two years and had just went back to work towards the end of the year so I had made just a little bit over $4500.00,with one dependant. When she was done which took her only about twenty minutes,she showed me how much I would be getting back and how much was being deducted.When I saw it was almost $400 I asked why so high when I didnt make that much money and only had one dependant.She said she hadn't applied the $50 coupon plus the $15 coupon I printed up off the internet,after the deductions it was still almost $350 something dollars she told me that that amount included the bank fees,she never showed me a brake down nor told me that I had the options of taking my taxes elsewhere if I didnt agree with the fees,I also requested the RAL refund 1-3 days and she never told me that that was only for the first $1,000.00 minus the $42 for the bank fees,she never told me I had to wait for 8-15 dys to recieve the rest which would be on the card,she told me I would recieve a check,that was also false information,when she printed up the tax papers and went to get them from the printer and came back to her desk with them she took the papers off the top that showed the break down of how much she was charging me to prepare my taxes and the difference the bank was charging me,the only papers she gave to me were the papers to sign that showed how much I was getting back,I never knew how much she was charging me to do my taxes minus the bank fees until three days later when I received the first $1,0000 minus the $42 in bank fees on the card. I also spoke with her boss the owner who's name is Allen and he even said that I should of seen the fees of how much she was charging me seperate from the bank fees and I explaind to him that she took those papers and turned them over and never showed them to me,she only gave me the papers to sign,and all he did was apologize and said he cant refund me any of my money back.She basically conned me into getting my taxes done there without making me fully aware of my options to take my taxes elsewhere,and showing how much I was seperately being charged from the bank fees for my taxes as well as I payed extra money to receive my taxes in 1-3 days to still have to wait 8-15 days to receive all of my money which I was told I would get within 1-3 days.I was misinformed as well as falsely informed and I want back the difference I would have paid had I would of taken my taxes elsewhere which is $200,and also and additional $500 for emotional distress due to my situation as far as me being pregnant in my third trimester.
We have been going there for 3 years with no issues until this year, Brenda did our taxes and she made a $2100.00 mistake, apparently she entered the stimulus amount wrong even after my husband told her he would get the correct amount, her answer to him was it doesnt't matter what you got? Apparently it does that mistake has shorted us $2100.00 but do they care no, my husband called to talk to manager last week, she was out of town, she supposedly comes back a week later and tells him there is nothing they can do? Excuse me, are you guys not tax professionals? I WILL NEVER GO TO JACKSON HEWITT AGAIN and I will tell everyone that I possibly can that they are liars and crooks. I am three months pregnant and we could have really used this money. Me being pregnant this has left me totally stressed out, we were told we were getting a amount of money $4356.00 for a refund and only got 1666.00 after fees and such. I don't think that its right that there is nothing they should do, why the hell do we have to pay them so much if they are not held responsible and if you don't know what your doing don't mess with peoples money especially in these times.
I have been going to Jackson Hewitt for many years and have NEVER had a problem with them.....until this year. The company actually took a turn this year and I found myself being mislead, lied to, and overcharged. Let alone they made a $900.00 error on my return (good thing for them I didn't get the Gold Guarantee...too bad for me though). Then to boot I received my refund later than they told me. I think we all need to join together and submit these complaints to the Better Business Bureau. If anyone else was mislead about the ipower card I'd be interested in hearing your story.
I filed my taxes with them and had my refund put on the i power card. There were purchases that I saw on line that I did not make. Contacted the companies for these purchases and one gave me a ship to address, I looked up the address and it came up with my tax preparers name. Filed police report and contacted Jackson Hewitt. Nothing is being done. This ahs been going on since 01/23/2009. I was out of $1100.00 but after contacting these companies I was able to get back all but $200.00. Jackson Hewitt will not investigate to get my money back. They said he is fired and anyone in that office could have done this. I have had to take time from my job to do all of the foot work. They are not helping me at all. Any info I got I gave to the police for the report. Police said that I could not prosecute the tax preparer because I didn't see him ordering on line. Wonder how the Merch ended up at his address? What hurts is I have been a customer of Jackson Hewitt for over 8 years. I will never go back and will not recommend it to anyone!
I tried calling the phone # listed on my papaer work and it is a fast busy signal. Then I called the customer service line and they can not give me the # to that office location. The customer service line gave me an office close to me but then gave me the fax # not the store #. So I decided to go over to the office that prepared my taxes and they saw the mistake but then told me that I would have to come back tomorrow 02/12 and do an amendment and I have to pay for the amendment to be done and then they will refund my money back. Why should I have to pay any more money than what I already paid which is $469.00 to have my taxes prepared. I would like my money refunded to me. Well I said to the girl in the office not Cinnamon the preparer (she was not in) that I would call the corporate office and complain and she said that there wasn't any. I advised that I will contact the customer service # to get that info. When I called customer service one rep gave me a phone # . to no avail I got voice mail. I called back the customer service # and they advised me that they could not give me a corporate #. I said that I already have one she said that she could not give me one. I said that I want to speak to someone in the corporate office a live person and they refused to give me any info...said that they will email my complaint and have someone call me back. I advised that I would like a cb by 02/12/09 she said that she could not promise that I said that. if Jackson Hewitt tells me that I have to come back tomorrow to amend my taxes and give them more money than they should be able to call me back in a timely manor...which to me is 24 hrs. Madeline the supervisor at Jackson Hewitt Customer Service said that she could not promise that. I advised that if I do not have a call back by 4pm EST 02/12/09 than I will contact the BBB, News Channels and every one else that can listen to how the rape your wallet and they will not stand by thier product. They want more money to do the service that they were supposed to do right the first time.
I had Jackson Hewitt prepare my taxes, but they made mistakes on it. I should have received more than I did. I am trying to fix it, but they act like they don't want to help. If they make a mistake, I believe the fees should be returned whether you have a guarantee or not. They are supposed to be tax professionals, but they are just normal people who hurry up and pass a tax class, but have absolutely NO idea what they are doing. I hope Jackson Hewitt goes out of business. I didn't receive the total amount of the refund I was entitled to. I had to pay fees to get my taxes filed, but with many errors on the behalf of Jackson Hewitt.
Well my husband and I took our W2 forms to an office in town, Little did we know that would be the biggest mistake of the year! The lady who filled out our forms did not have a clue what she was doing! We had to correct almost everything from names to birthdates! Which was all right in front of her? When we walked into the office the very first question we asked her was if we should be waiting on any kind of forms from an IRA that my husband had taken out in 08, She told us no that she could just put it on our return. So we asked her several times after that if she had added that to ours forms and every time she assured us that she had! Well low and behold a 1099 form came in the mail the very next day, so my husband calls the lady back and she informs us that we will have to pay a $110.00 amendment fee to fix it because it was never put on the form and that if had been we would not have to pay for the amendment! So I told my husband to hang up the phone and I called the main office in our town and asked to speak with Patsy Busby, who was very rude but agreed to our amendment for free. So when I called her back and she stated that our penalty fee for the IRA had went form 230.00 to 1063.00 I was shocked and asked how that came about? She told me that she would not explain it over the phone that we would have to meet! So my husband and I met with her on Saturday 2/6/2009 and have the whole conversation recorded! She was very rude, yelled at us in the middle of the office with workers and customers present and pretty much told that we could leave and when we insisted that she talk to us her cell phone rings and she answers it and starts talking on it after we waited three days to talk to her and the whole conversation took Seven minutes! So we left, and I have spoke to several different people at the main office in Little Rock Arkansas to get a refund for what we paid to get them done. They are about as much help as the local people were, they keep making excuses and are just as rude!
I usually go to H&R Block to have my taxes prepared, but I moved in the late spring of last year, and where I live, the Jackson Hewitt office is closer. So I went out on a limb, and decided that I'd give them a try. The preparation went smoothly, and I opted for the Refund Anticipation Loan (RAL). My total for the preparation fees came to $400.95, which is a bit steep, but nonetheless, I did not mind paying these fees, because i needed the money promptly, and as we all know, there's a price to pay for convenience. January 31st was the day that I filed my taxes; February 1st, it was accepted by the IRS; February 2nd, I was informed by the automated 1-866 number that the bank denied my RAL, and a paper check would be issued in 8-15 days. Now- I have a bit of a problem with this. why was I denied? I can't seem to get an answer from anyone. In the past two years, I've gotten the money back in the form of an RAL, the very next day, with no problem. What is the bank's decision based on? It can't be my credit score, because my score is in the 700's. It's definitely got me annoyed, because I could have gone to a small, independently owned office here in town, and had my taxes prepared for $65. Or, I could have gone online and done it myself for free. Either of these two options that I had would have left me waiting about two weeks for the IRS to direct deposit the money into my bank account. But as I already stated, I needed the money faster, so I decided against those options. Now I have to wait for the Santa Barbara Bank and Trust to recieve my money from the IRS, print a paper check, and send it to the local office. When it arrives there, They're supposed to contact me, and then I can go pick it up. I gave them my bank account and routing numbers- why aren't they direct deposting the money into my account? It all sounds a bit fishy to me, and from all of the complaints I've seen, it seems like the bank doesn't even have the funds to front the money to people. Jackson Hewitt should not falsely offer a rapid refund if they don't have the resources to supply this service. It's a gimmick, a way for them to make more money off of you, by promising something they cannot deliver. I'll never use Jackson Hewitt again, that's for sure. I'll stick with my good ol' H&R Block, or do them myself. I can't say that I enjoy this ride that I've been taken on. It's not what I signed up for. I've been over charged for a service that was not delivered as promised, and have been told that I cannot be even partially refunded
I went to jackson Hewitt to get my tax done . To get them back the next day . the told me i couldnt do that . it would be 7 to 10 days. i said ok going on the 2nd week and counting still no check it cost me 300 and some . to get it done and i want my money back the I.R.S has excepted my refund a week ago . what the smack. i want my money back today! my mom was in the hospital had no money for flowers. I got bills due a week ago there going toget my truck if i dont get my money soon Iam laid off from work and only getting 100$ a week so i need my money bad so to get my bills payed off!
I am trully frustrated at this point. I am currently on the phone with Jackson Hewitt ipower accounts and have been on hold for some time. The issue is pretty much this. I placed on order on walmart.com and the order was cancelled by walmart because they are particular about the type of credit cards you use. The authorization is a substantial amount. I have made at leaset 1 phone call per day sometimes 5 or more to jackson hewitt ipower accounts, now being charged 2.50 every time I make that call. Any how because of the amount of the purchase they require a fax with information on it as to why the order was cancelled and merchant id and authorization code all that jive. I have requested the fax from walmart on 5 different days, the faxed the first one on Feb 4 2009. However people at the call center including management can't seem to find this fax. So once again today I requested walmart resend that info. They should have it in a few hours. So in the mean time I will wait on that. My other authoriztion stems from a gas station where I was going to pay at the pump used my ipower card got the ok and then realized I had left my key to my gas tank at home. So I canceled the transaction, went inside and asked the clerk if it had canceled and she said yes it did so I then bought a few things from inside the store and left. Later that day I went to an ATM and tried to get cash and it kept saying insf. funds. So I came home checked my account online and realized that there was now 75.50 being held as an authorization for gas I NEVER GOT! So I called corporate office of the place where I was going to get gas gave her all the information she would need to clear up this issue with Jackson hewitt ipower accounts, however every time she would call they would hang up on her. So finally I just called her then called ipower on 3 way to get this matter cleared up. She had to research to get the information needed, I still need to call her back. In the mean time I called to ipower accounts and was on the phone with them asked them to hold for a minute while i contacted walmart to clear up that issue he said sure, had walmart on the phone and clicked back over only to discover the gentlemen i was speaking with hung up on me.
robot calls, I am on the do not call list, Can't find a corp.office #
On February 10,2009 I saw Trent D standing outside of the Jackson Hewitt building. I did not know he worked there- he was outside on his cell phone. There are other businesses in the same shopping center- so I did not know he worked at JH. I motioned for him to come over to the car. He did, and we began to talk about him and his x-girlfriend (my step daughter). She had told him not to claim her child (not his child by blood) on his taxes this year. And she recorded the conversation. She found out that he had and I was simply telling him that they knew he had and that she had called the IRS. His sister, EDWANA B works there. (nor did I know that). After he and I had a conversation, she called me (left a message on the answering machine) from the Jacksin Hewitt number threatening me if I came up there again she would have me banned from the area. She proceeded to yell and make accusations over the answering machine so long that it finally cut her off. (over a minute long hateful message) I still have this message and would love for someone to hear it. Mostly because she called from HER JOB and had time to do this- where is the level of professionalism there. I will certainly not recommend anyone to go there since she is there. If I had known either of them worked there, I would not have talked to him. His and my conversation was not ugly anyhow. She made it ugly by calling my phone. how does it look when you see "Jackson Hewitt" on the caller ID and then the message left is so bold and hateful? I plan to call the Better Business Bureau also to report this, but I wanted to start here first. Hopefully it can be resolved before it goes that far.
well I went into the store on monday the 12 09 and they did my tax and said that the irs did not open untill friday so that was fine. I tried to get the 24 hr loan. they said to call sat to see if i had been approved! when i called back they said they was still waiting so i called sunday and they said they i was approved and that the money should be there by five that day or the next well when i call the next day they said it was not approved and i said you just told me yesterday the i was well moving on. well i was supposed to get it by 1-30-09 or 2-6-09. i still have not got it and they are saying i will not get it untill 2-24-09. they took my state and put it on this card and it was supposed to be sent in the form of a check to then for me to pick up but they took it upon them selfs to put this on my card for the fees. i had no idea the to file my federal was going to cost me over 200 and my state over 50. i have never had this much trouble with my taxs and i have always used jackson hewitt. i will never again us them. i need to pay bills and can really use my money
My husband went to Jackson Hewitt to file our taxes and I was going to go the next day and sign, when he saw that we were only getting back $4600.00 before the $260.00 fees, he knew something was wrong. I am a homemaker and my husband makes less than $65,000.00 a year and we have four kids under the age of ten. He told the guy that he wasn't going to file the taxes with them and asked for his w2's back. the man refused to give them back saying its against the law to give them back. no, it's against the law to NOT give them back. My husband left because he belived the guy. I called the next day and said I would be coming to pick up my forms and the lady told me that we owed her $79.00 for prepration fees. WHAT? They were not prepared and futhermore I wasn't even there. Nothing had been signed whatsoever! I ended up paying the $79.00 just so I could get my w2's and house payment intrest form back so I could file somewhere elese, but I think what they did was illagal! They cannot keep someones personal doucoments from them. Just like a buissness cannot not send you a w2 form because you were a lousy worker or quit on them. Their your documents and you are intitled to them!
it was not clearly explained to me about this ipower card, i was not told that if i did this card in the begining that i had to file the same way for my refund. i have had nothing but problems with this card double transaction charges, no one to contact to clear this up. nobody seems to have contact numbers for the bank that is handling this. i have been brought to tears because even now that im typing to you they have over 700.00 of my money held up with deplicate charges. that no one seems to know how to help me. it has been over a week and it is still not cleared up. never again. not being able to receive my money, deplicate charges. not being able to pay my bills
the person who did my tax return d. millam. he made up all my income and all my tax return was not correct. only thing he got right was my ss. number and my name. i took it to get it fixed and the area maniger is not going to fix it unless i pay for an amended witch i also have the gold guaranty. she refuses to give me copies of my signed paper work and i sent her a certified letter demanding copies but still refuses to help. this lady has a problem and i wish for something to be done about this. she has caused alot of trouble for me as well as loosing alot of business for the future did not add my w2's and made a fraud claim to the irs as far as my income. did not add my dependants and will not stand behind the gold guaranty
I took my taxes in on Jan.31, 2009 to have them prepared.On Feb.1 at about 300pm a gentlemam from that office Darren or Aaron called me to tell me that the preparer had forgotten to take a copy of my W2's. Because it was so late in the evening i advised him that i would drop them off first thing on Monday Feb 2nd. in which i did. On Feb.4th i called the IRS processing center to check o the status there was no record of my returns. On Feb, 5th i again called to check on my status of my return and have been continueing to do so daily and i still have not received my refunf nor does anyone have any knowledge of when my return will be ready. I am payiny for a RAL Refund so that i could have received my returns in a propmt manner. The time period is well over due and i could have elected to have received a paper check if i knew that having my taxes prepared would have been such a problem. I feel as though i should be refunded my preparation fees due to errors with preparation. I asked Michelle as to why i was never notified on this problem however she was not able to give a specfic answer, this is not good custmer service on behalf of staff. [I want refund my preparation fees]
I went to jackson hewitt for the second year in a row. I applied for the ral loan and recieved that the next day, with 600.00 coming in 8-16 days. After day 18 I called the branch thinking maybe the check went to them instead, the lady told me she did't know when or how it would come, and that the IRS takes their sweet time depositing funds. I found it hard to believe that she did't know this info, after all am I the only person in this area who applied for this? Well I checked with the IRS and my return had several mistakes made which has caused it to be delayed, and now instead of 600.00 I may receive 250.00. I paid 395.00 for them to file my taxes correctly, I should get that back. I am going back to tax act.com My electric was shut off.
I am a Spanish speaking woman and was having my taxes prepared by Jackson Hewitt for the first time. I have a simple filing, one w2 and a daughter. I had also provided three years of returns as well to make it even simpler. I was received my forms after having signed many documents. I returned home and a friend reviewed the forms and asked me how much it had cost me to prepare. I told him it was $122.00. He thought that might be a bit high as I had only paid $70 the year before. After looking into it a bit further he realized that I had paid $365 plus a $30.95 fee to have my taxes auto deposited within 8-15 days. I was confused when I walked out but as I had not paid or received any mony I thought it was going to be alright. I was to have received $1252 returned and when my friend contacted the office to inquire as to what the fees were after answering a few questions about the the filing(3 of W2? any Dependents? ) he was told it would cost about $100-$120. After questioning as to why then I was charged $365 Adeel's response was "Well you know she has a TIN#" when he was questioned as to what he was inferring he immediately changed the subject. He then stated that he had no control over the fees, everything was calculated by the system. My friend explained that I would like to have my returned canceled (this phone call was at 6:15), My fiend was told by Adeel that he (Adeel) would have to call his manager and discuss with him what could be done. This call ended at about 6:25 and then ten minutes passed and my friend thought that most likely the store would close at 7:00pm and I would then be told that all the paperwork for the day was submitted. My friend called back at 6:40 and was told that he would have to call the other location and speak with the manager Rahil. When originally asked in prior phone call we were told that the names could not be given out. The phone call was made at 6:45 to the Dundee store and Rahil answered and was immediately told that I wanted to cancel my submission because I was mislead into accepting fees and never clearly understood the fee I was paying. My friend spoke to Rahil in English and instructed him that I was right next to him and would like to speak to the Spanish speaking lady who had translated to me during the preparation time with Adeel. Rahil was told that I would be telling her that I wanted my tax return canceled. Rahil transfered the phone to Sandra and I expressed my desire to have my documents canceled this took all of 5 min and she said she would see what she could do. After about two minutes Sandra returned to the phone and said she couldn't cancel the return as it had already been processed. I passed the phone to my friend who was told the same thing. He had asked what the time stamp on the submit ion of the document was. He was told 6:58pm. At this time it was 7:03 and he had explained that this was exactly why there was a rush to call, so that this could not happen. There was some complaining done and the call was returned to Rahil , after a few more complaints and a request for Rahil's last name, my friend was told if he wanted Rahil's last name he would have to come to the store to get it and Rahil hung up the phone. At 7:30 we went over to the store on Dundee with all the documents to see if the cancellation was still possible. When we walked in, the first request from my fiend was to get business cards from Rahil and Sandra. After reviewing the forms, Rahil couldn't explain the $365 fee and tried to explain that the base price they charged was $190 and it went up from there. When questioned by my friend about why he was quoted $100-$120 Rahil then got up and went in the back where there were two other men listening intently to everything that was going on. He then returned and said he would write a check for $200. However the check would not be written until the return had cleared from the IRS as they didn't receive the money until the release. My friend questioned as to see if Rahil would write something out to that effect. Rahil agreed and then My friend remembered, Rahil wrote his name on a blank business card and Adeel had one printed with his name on it. So after Rahil completed the document stating that the $200 would be paid when funds were received and signed it my friend requested that another employee in the office witness and sign the document. My friends thinking was that when the time passed and I questioned where the $200 was and submitted the letter, I would be told that Rahil didn't work here or was not authorized to make that decision. Rahil looked at my friend confused as to what I was requesting and suggested that he sign it . After explaining to Rahil that it would be appropriate to have two signatures from both parties to be perfect. Immediately one of the men from behind the wall came out and started yelling that my friend was being unreasonable and that that was it, he grabbed the payment letter and ripped up. This person then stated that the return would be (I forget the word) but canceled and I would then be free to submit another return at some other company. My friend questioned the rational and then questioned just what this person stated. Again, we were told that as soon as the tax return was cleared it would be canceled. My friend made a phone call to the police department to question the legal situation we were in and was told it was a Civil matter at that point and no laws had been broken so it could end with an agreement by both parties. We accepted the cancellation. Which is what I wanted in the first place but had to fight and complain from 5:30 until 8:30. The bottom line is that not only is the experience a horrible event to have had to go through, I am a single mother doing what I can to raise my daughter, teaching her to be independent and not to let people take advantage of her and she went though this whole process from start to finish. I have been embarrassed having been but through this. I feel I have been taken advantage of and the stress of having to fight to make it right is just extremly unreasonable.
My husband and I filed a joint return on 1/22/09. We applied for an RAL and informed the next day that it was denied (turned out we got a credit from the previous year which increased the anticipated refund amount but sent out a flag and delayed our refund) and would change over to the assisted refund and we would get our refund in the 8 to 15 day range. I began checking both the jackson hewitt and irs where's my refund site pretty much daily. On 2-5-09 the irs web site stated that our funds would be direct deposited on 2-6-09 (into the santa barbara bank jackson hewitt processes the refunds through) 2-6-09 came and still no refund. Called the local office and they said they have no idea how long it takes them to process the money and issue the check. Now its the end of business day 2-7-09 and still no check. The person at local office says she doesnt know if checks print on Sundays or not, she believes they do. OK so what do they tell people who come in on saturdays who qualify for RAL? do they get a check on Sunday or have to wait until Monday??? I just think it is all misleading. I think you should be told upfront in the office if you qualify for the services you are applying for or not. The way they do business tricks people into spending money unecisarily for tax preparation and extra fees in the hopes that they can get their money immediately. If i had went on the website and filed it electronicaly myself the money woould have been direct deposited into our own account and be available to us now, without the fees, instead of sitting in a bank account somewhere in Santa Barbara probably earning them interest. Just like everyone else trying to get theses rapid refunds we needed our money back when we first filed and were willing to pay the fees to get our money fast. As it turns out we paid the fees for absolutley nothing and using Jackson Hewitt only prolonged receiving our refund. Who knows when we will finally get it???
As with every person that has made a public compliant against this so called Rapid Refund, I too will never deal with another large franchise tax preparation business. The Ipower card is a ripp off. Fee for this, fees for that. IT'S MY MONEY! Did you know that an ATM inquiry costs $.50? If you use the card as a debit and not a credit - yep...it's a charge. And they do not load the card as promised. But then the card and the endless fees associated with this card are NOT explained to anyone. The best way to avoid this endless parade of fees is to tranfer that money out & ito a bank acct. - charge again. And there is a limit on the amount you can tranfer off. My card was not loaded with the full amount. They played with MY MONEY before they loaded the balance of my Federal Tax Refund - over $600.00 14 days later. And my State was loaded on it too, yet the girl at the office kept telling everyone State refunds are mailed to your home. So everyone out there, how do you feel knowing Jackson Hewitt pimps a product that gives the banks your money to earn interest not paid to you? Not to mention the fees you pay for the priviledge of using YOUR money. Then to add insult to injury, I received a letter from IRS stating I owe over $1,000.00 for unreported wages - unemployment compensation.Was I asked or told you pay taxes on unemployment compensation - NO. Now I know I have to file an amended return for 2007 & 2008. Thanks Jackson Hewitt and Ipower card. Can I at least get a kiss for that screwing?
As with every person that has made a public compliant against this so called Rapid Refund, I too will never deal with another large franchise tax preparation business. The Ipower card is a ripp off. Fee for this, fees for that. IT'S MY MONEY! Did you know that an ATM inquiry costs $.50? If you use the card as a debit and not a credit - yep...it's a charge. And they do not load the card as promised. But then the card and the endless fees associated with this card are NOT explained to anyone. The best way to avoid this endless parade of fees is to tranfer that money out & ito a bank acct. - charge again. And there is a limit on the amount you can tranfer off. My card was not loaded with the full amount. They played with MY MONEY before they loaded the balance of my Federal Tax Refund - over $600.00 14 days later. And my State was loaded on it too, yet the girl at the office kept telling everyone State refunds are mailed to your home. Not to mention the fees you pay for the priviledge of using YOUR money. Then to add insult to injury, I received a letter from IRS stating I owe over $1,000.00 for unreported wages - unemployment compensation. Was I asked or told you pay taxes on unemployment compensation - NO. Now I know I have to file an amended return for 2007 & 2008. As stated, I know this is going to cost me over $1000.00 plus interest compounded daily if I don't pay it in full which I cannot. I am 52 years old and have NEVER owed IRS a dime until Jackson Hewitt prepared my taxes. I work for the State and part of my job detail gives me the authority by IRS to audit Tax Credit properties. Am I embarassed not to mention scared that I may be viewed as irresponsible due to this. Plus I feel I am now flagged for future audits by IRS.
The lady had no idea what she was doing. I had to basically walk her through 45% of the process. That should have been my first hint to get up and run. Then come to find out they jipped me out of over $700 of my state refund. The Refund participation loan is a scam. They say no qualifications have to be met but then you get a decline notice. I was told to call the number at the bottom and they couldn't tell me why i was declined. all he said was that it could be because i have never filed my taxes with jackson hewitt before. i have to contact the irs to try to amend my taxes so that i can get my correct refund amount. and see if i can stop jackson hewitts filing i dont want them making any money off me.
I cannot believe I am still waiting for my taxes!!! I filed a for a refund aniticipation loan(RAL) on 1/24/09 and was never explained nothing about it. They didn't say that it was credit based or something on my tax form could affect the decision. I needed the money quick and still havn't gotten it. I asked the lady quite a few times in my visit if she was sure I could get it within a day. She said yes without any disregard that I might not get it. Well when I called the next day on 1/25/09 they were very rude to me saying they were busy with other customers and havnt checked the fax machine for checks yet. Am I not a customer?! It takes two seconds to run out back and look, plus I called right when they opened, so why didn't they look and see if anything was faxed? Well I asked them why I was denied and they said they didn't know. They gave me the number to Santa Barbara Trust Bank. The number is for checking the RAL request. You enter your information and then it tells you if you are denied or not. I did that and it said I was denied because of information that makes it ineligible for this loan. At the end of the message it states what date to call back on to see if the IRS had made a deposit. The date was Febuary 6th, 2009. So I actually talked to a representative at this bank and they didn't know what they were talking about. They didn't even specify why I couldn't get this loan. I was ******! Today is febuary 6th and I called Jackson Hewitt to see if my funds were in yet and they weren't. Now when I call that bank number it says no new date for when my refund will be in. I talked to a representative again today and they are trying to say that the IRS only deposits money once a week. How is that possible when people file differently and on different days? Something just isnt right about this company and this bank. They lie, decieve, and don't even know what they are doing! They are a rip off. I tried seeing if I could get it changed from a check to direct deposit and I guess that is not possible. For as long as I have waited and how much further in debt I am now is not right. Especially when I called the lady up from Jackson Hewitt today she said if the bank said that is the anicipated date of deposit the IRS usually gets it in. And it is not. So I look like I am lying to my landlord because I keep telling him my deposit dates, and they keep changing! Even the IRS website keeps changing! And now it is saying I have to check up in a week instead of an actual deposit date! I can't go much longer and don't feel that Jackson Hewitt deserves my money because for as long as I have waited I could have filed the damn thing myself and gotten my money faster probably! I am going to fight them and call a tax advocate because this has been too long. It has been two weeks since I have filed and shouldn't have a reason to wait any longer.
Why is it every year I receive phone calls at my residence about return checks and their status??? I get phone calls all hours of the day & night from your customers & I'm getting sick and tired of it, this has been going on for 5-6 years now. I talked to corporate last year and was assured that this would stop apparently they lied. I was told that they had this number for 15 years that means nothing to me as I've had mine for 23+ years. I just want this to stop immediately, educate your customers with telephone numbers & their use. I expect an answer either by phone / e-mail or whatever means as long as I get an answer ASAP>
I had my taxes done on or around January 28th and was charged around $296 for tax preparation. While having my taxes done I asked if I could just mail my taxes off myself and I was told it would still have to pay the $296 for fees. I have been having my taxes done by Jackson Hewitt since 2002 but this is my last year dealing with them. I have never had a problem with them until now. I was so upset with the charge for the preparation that I called their main office on McArthur road to find out what the fees are for filing taxes. I was told by a rude person that they start at $89.00. I told the lady at that office that I normally pay $100 or maybe $200 to get my taxes done with the rapid refund and now its gone up $100 since last year. I had only one W2 form and I didn't itemize or anything. The lady I spoke with said the fees went up because of the paperwork and the work they put in to doing taxes. I told her I took the tax class and all you have to do is put in the information on the W2 and the computer program does all the figuring for you. At the end of the conversation I assured her that I would not be getting my taxes done at Jackson Hewitt anymore and she didn't try to say anything to me to make me want to come back next year. The business is shady with a big S. Times are hard right now with the ecomony so bad its a shame for Jackson Hewitt to take advantage of people that has been doing business with them for years.
I visited a Jackson-Hewitt office at Wal-mart in Biloxi,Ms at 0900 on a Saturday. I questioned the tax person about receipts I kept throughout the year on different expenses. She told me to bring the receipt with me when i return to file for taxes. I brought the receipts, but she didn;t acknowledge the receipts when presented to her. I am not sure that I got a full tax refund. Last year another tax paper at Jackson-Hewitt advised me to hold on to my expens receipts to file for 2008 taxes. Then, she went on to say we will call you sunday to pick up your check. My wife and I sat home all day Sunday awaiting the phone call. I finally called the lady and asked what is the status of my check? She said the loan was denied, and couldn't tell me why. She didn't fully disclose to me that the loan was based up approval or approval of a credit score. I felt very mislead by the tax preparer. Now, my tax return is handled by SBBT bank and then back through Jackson- Hewitt. I will never return to Jackson hewitt and will not recommend the company. She was more interested in letting us go to eat her food with her husband waiting for her. I can't believe all the time and money I will lose to complete a simple tax return. Just Bad customer service all around. Stress...my wife and I needed the one day service to catch up on bills and other expenses. I don't know when we are going to receive our tax return. Also, how much will be left after the bank and Jackson-Hewitt take out their fees.
I went to Jackson Hewitt to get my taxes done on January 15th,2009 and I was told that I would be getting a refund of 8483.00 I asked the tax preparer are you sure? He told me yes and i was very excited. When I received my income tax check it was only for 7283.00 so I called the IRS to see if someone had garnished my taxes and they told me no. They told me that Jackson Hewitt gave me the wrong refund amount so when I called the man at Jackson Hewitt who prepared my taxes to question him about the problem he told me that there was a glich in the system and that he was sorry and that he had been getting alot of calls about this same problem and that there was nothing he could do. I then called the corporate office so I thought and a lady answered the call and took my complaint and told me that she would make my problem a priority and that I would would be hearing from the corporate office on Monday because it was a Friday. She said that she would have to forward the complaint to corporate, well its been over a week and I still have not heard anything from anyone I called back and spoke to the same woman who absolutely knows anything about anything! and all she could say is Im sorry I will forward this to corporate and I told her I thought you already did that! The bottom line is I would like for Jackson Hewitt to give me the $1200.00 dollars that my paper work says that I should get. It is not my fault that the system has a glich in it and that is not a good enough explanation for me I should be compensated because i paid them over $300.00 dollars to do my taxes and then they make a mistake and the only thing they can tell me to try and make me feel better is that this has been happening to alot of people this year. I will never use them again! I had made plans to pay off some things with all of my money and spent some money that I would have not if I had known that Jackson hewitt made a mistake
Follow up on my post from 1/23, I still have not received my money and it is now 2/5. I finally talked to the owners son who said that the preparer was new and just didn't have the correct information. DUH you turn her loose unsupervised to play with people's lives like that? He then told me that the AR check returns are only received on Thursdays and Fridays. So I guess I dont have to call that 800 number to see if the check is in over and over. I also heard from the IRS. It seems that the preparer made an error on my return, something to do with the stimilus rebate. The owner's son said yea the IRS didn't tell us until a week ago that it was supposed to be left blank so all the returns were held up. I don't have any faith in actually getting money any time soon. And the fees they charge are definitely not worth the lies and headaches. Oh, he did offer a discount for next year's preparation. I'm going to wait until I get my money to tell him what he can do with THAT!
I went to jackson hewitt this year as i have for the past 5 years, but this was a different location. when i arrived it just seemed like the tax preparer was hurring to sit me down, stomping on the key board after each question faster and faster and after, she was just pretty much reaching to get me out after the paper work just to get to the next person, its like they make commision on each person. anyway after i was done i seat down to watch as the last customer of the day was uppon her desk. she took all the time in the world for this person eveery year i get the next day loan every year i got it, i was denied! so i came in to talk with this so called professional, and she said to call the bank, or the irs! she says this is out of my hands i was so sickened when the verry next moment i noticed the lady from yesterday she had came in and asked for her check and they delevierd, she was so in a hurry to get the last customer, she missed filed my taxes. im still waiting i was laid off my job as a local security professional LOCKSMITH and i was really hopping on this money. my car was repoed i had to move my soon to be wife and kids to my moms house cause i lost my house, i guess i should not count my chickens but what do you expect 5 years not a problem im so upset. yet i cannot do a thing about it but wait for my return and thats if there is no other problems, something must be done about jackson hewitt.
I should have gotten the earned income credit. Question the lady multi times and she just played dumb. Also put the wrong birthdate on my tax return. I need to call IRS tomorrow to find out what I need to do to correct the mistake she did so I can get my refund. This was my first and last time I will use them. Can do a better job messing my taxes up myself without having to pay someone to do it. I am sure I wont get my money back I paid to have them done,
They rush you right out they do not tell you every thing i will never never go there again and the sevice was really messed up this year as for the ipower card so many changes on it .It driving me crazy .Next year I am going to HR Block. I felt my taxes was not done right at all
I filed with Jackson Hewitt on 1/16/09. I applied for the RAL loan. The next day I got a call saying I didnt get approved. I asked why, but they could not give me an answer. They told me that I would have t wait 8-15 days for my refund and according to the bank they use Republic Bank I was supposed to get my refund on 1/30/09. I called Republic Bank and Jackson Hewitt the entire day on 1/20/09 but still no refund. I finally got to speak with someone at a Corporate Branch office with Jackson Hewitt in my area and was told that because of a tax credit the IRS gave me is why it was placed on hold. They then said that my refund would take an additional 8-15 days. I told them I am not going to wait that long for my refund. I signed an agreement with them stating I was supposed to get my money, but everytime I would call I would get a different story. I even called the IRS and they said they most likely are not gonna realse the funds til on or after 2/15/09. Jackson Hewitt is stating they are not going to cut me a check until they get there money from the IRS first. I said that doesnt make sense if you use a bank to give out loan for anticipated monies from the IRS why do I have to wait until they get there money from the IRS. The whole situation just does not make since. I was told the money would then be here on 2/4/09 and to no surprise....still no money.They now cannot give my a date or any information regarding when my refund is expected to come in. It is an outrage, it is rediculous, and I have already advised them they will be hearing from a lawyer. I have lost my car, utilities disconnected, and about to be evicted from my home. I have been unable to keep food in my house and have to get handouts from other people just to make it day by day.
Basically no up front costs were presented in writing before the taxes were prepared even though I asked for them. Next I specifically asked before the taxes were prepared if they only efiled today how soon would I get the tax refund - he did not answer the question but continued to ask me questions - in other words - he knew by talking to me that I could efile on my own as I had done in previous years - I am unemployed and really needed the money quicker than the 10 days to efile into my bankaccount. He eluded the questions so I would continue and then charged me the full amount for the next day RAL loan. Then he wouldn't let me read the printed information once he was finished and that's when I knew something was really wrong. It states right on the form that you are supposed to read fully and understand and sign that everything is correct. He badgered me into signing by making statement's such as "I have been talking with you for over an hour and I have to get to other customers. I signed the paperwork and didn't read it. Then he wouldn't give me a copy of the signed paperwork only stapled paperwork into a file folder. Then I inspected that and requested the signed copies and he said no, I said there isn't even a 1040 in this paperwork and he said we don't print those out for customers. Then another man in the office said I can print that out for you Wade. Then he stated that the check (which by the way I requested it be sent to the bank and he said no we'll make it a cashiers check. Then he said that he would call me tomorrow so I could come pick up the check. At 2:00pm I did not recieve a call so I went into the store directly and asked if the check was there. Wade came to the front even though he was with a customer and said "I called you at 9am and could not get ahold of you - I said I was home and I have an aswering service on my cell phone. He hemmed and haughed and said well I called. Clearly he had not, but I had called the bank myself and they said automated that the loan was denied. I asked why the loan was denied and he said you would have to call the bank and gave me an 888 number and I talked to a customer service person who said the IRS sent an email and they could not process the loan. I said what does that mean, he says I don't know. I called the IRS and talked with an agent and they actually made a conference call because they said they hadn't even received my efile yet. In other words - the IRS had not received an efile from Jackson Hewitt yet they were saying that they denied my loan because the IRS sent an email to them. The man the IRS agent talked with said no that is not the case they never received anything from the IRS. So was the company not being up front with the payment process or the filing process. The badgered me into signed forms I had not read. They said the IRS denied it even though the bank then said no. They ripped me off of filing fees for something I could have filed for 30.00 efile myself. So in other words; if they had pre-sent a bank loan approval before the taxes were prepared they could have told me I was not approved (that was not the case since clearly I have no reason for the bank not to approve) so they took my money knowing they could not gaurantee the loan process and charged me for tax preparation of hundreds of dollars that I could have done myself for 30.00 bucks and efiled myself. Now I know I should have been more informed as this was my first year have a tax preparer but when I walked into HR Block they said the cost will be 200.00 up front in the first minutes of talking. I feel that the company has some prepares that are new maybe (I don't know) but to tell me that I will get a check the next day and I agree only to pay if that is the case and when it is not they force me to sign with pressure.
On 1-29-09 I went to Jackson Hewitt the same as every year for the past 5 years. This year I did the i-power card and got the Holiday loan so I have to use this card for my taxes. I was ripped off! First of all it cost 408.00 just for the preparation and that's deducting a 25 dollar coupon and another 35 dollars that was deducted from the ipower in advance. Then I was charged another 135.00 for the RAL! A total of 543.00, what a joke! Then I was denied the RAL because SBT said there were common errors or problems w/the return. Now It will take 8-15 days. I called the 800 number 3 times and was told they would e-mail my local office and someone would get back to me, I waited all last week, nothing. I went down there today and there were a lot of other customers complaining and I found out I have been being charged interest fees [when I was told there were none until March] and that it will cost 1.5% of the total on my card if I want to transpher it to my bank! If I close the card it's another 15 dollar fee! I was given a booklet today that explained some of it; that they never gave me before. There was a couple in there that said they were told we have to wait over 21 days or untill the IRS releases the money. This couple said they've been waiting 25 days already. They also said the ipower website said the money is avalable and they still can't get there money off. I am so upset! My tax refund is over 5,000. I need it for my mortgage and my untility bills! My gas and electric was 650.00 last month (NIPSCO NW Indiana [the bills are outragious]) and I'm affraid we'll end up getting shut off before I ever see a penny of my tax return! I feel this is DEFINETLY preditory lending! I will never go to Jackson Hewitt again and for everyone eles out there DO NOT get the i-power card and stay away from Jackson Hewitt! I will probably loose my home; I needed this refund to get my mortgage up to date.
I went to Jackson Hewitt on 02/02/09 to file taxes. I have gone to them for about 10 years and never had a problem. I got a money now loan the same day and the rest would be put on the ipwer card (rip-off) the next day. I called and they said I was denied and Jackson Hewitt & SBBT have given me the run around. I would like to have my processing charges back. If I knew I was going to have to wait 8 to 15 days I would have done them myself and sent them to the IRS for free. I am very upset and disgusted with this. Put off paying up our bills
This place was not great at all. I had an issue with Crystal. After explaining to her that I only want a direct deposit, and not a check I was issued a check anyway. The first young lady who helped me was inexperienced and may not have meant any harm so I could not blame her too much. She tried her best to assist me with the knowledge she was given. I did provide my routing and account numbers to her. She asked for me to come another day due to a system issue (no problem). The problems started when I met with Crystal. It was fine at first until I received the fee amount. I was originally told the amount was for approximately 125.00 -135.00 (preparer's fee) without a next day check (first young lady). But after Crystal completed the paperwork the total came to 192.00. I asked why such the high amount when it is to be direct deposit and I could receive it in 8-14 days.The IRS gives the same time fram for electronic filing. She states it was because of bank fees. Bank fees! what do they have to do with this if it is simple electronic filing going straight to the IRS? I stated I just want a direct deposit, no check. She states if I did not want a check it would only be $15.00 less which would come to around 176.00 for next day service. Why is it I call today and she states my check is ready? After I tell her I wanted direct deposit she statesYou signed for a check ! If that was the case why would I have given my routing and account numbers to the first rep? These people must make a bonus for having people get money right away. I felt very violated I still have to pick up my check. She was very shaky with details on the fees also. Does not sound right, especially after I have given my bank info to theses people
I paid $69 for this tax course. I completed 1 module and had difficulty with my computer at home. I went to the Cottman Ave office, Don M was the supervisor there. I read another module and didn't finish. I read in the NE Times about a free course being offered. I registered for that to complete the modules I had paid for and to learn how to do taxes. The first night at class at Cottman Avenue they didn't have me registered. The Supervisor called the main # and was told yes I was registered. No seat available. I went to Rising Sun and no seat first night. It was bitter cold out and I lost 4 hours that night. Went to Rising Sun 2nd of 4 nights and it was filthy there and filthy at Cottman Avenue office. The bathroom was a disgrace, filthy. My 3rd night there my seat was given away again to someone who was not at class any of the other 2 nights. I attempted to retrieve the course material I paid for, $69 and all course material was closed to me. I could not retrieve any course material I paid for. I called Holly, Mgr. in New Jersey office and she was irate. Her voice was high and strong and determined and nasty. I told her I didn't appreciate being spoken to like she did. She said write your little letter or whatever you have to do. She was totally out of control with her voice and her temper. She is a very bad reflection of Jackson Hewitt business.
I filed my taxes 1-29-09 and got the RAL option. I didnt get the money in my bank account the next day as was told I would so I called the number provided with ALL my paper work. The person at the other end said this was customer service and not the branch where I filed. I explained my trouble and was told he sees the check and does not know why it wasnt deposited. He said I will be refunded my fees for the RAL. On 2-02-09 The money was deposited in my checking but with only the amount that was due me and not my refunded fees. I called again and was told I have to return to the office I filed to get my fees returned. I did this today 2-03-09 and the lady there, Ms. Lisa quite rudeley told me she was no bank and had no money there for me! She got on the phone and called someone telling them there was a gentlman there(me) wanting his fees returned because he didnt get his(my) refund in a timely manner. After she spoke with this guy for a few minutes, she wrote a number down on the back of her card , gave it to me, and said call this number in 30 minutes and he will be in his office. I called, he wan't, and I am still waiting. Next year, I go somewhere else!!
I paid $69 for this tax course. I completed 1 module and had difficulty with my computer at home. I went to the Cottman Ave office, Don McDonald was the supervisor there.

The first night at class at Cottman Avenue they didn't have me registered. The Supervisor called the main # and was told yes I was registered. No seat available.

I told her I didn't appreciate being spoken to like she did. She said write your little letter or whatever you have to do. She was totally out of control with her voice and her temper. She is a very bad reflection of Jackson Hewitt business. I am out of $69 even though my computer was down at the time, I did go to the office at Cottman Avenue and I thought I would continue the modules with the course I had already paid for. She said I was notified which was a lie, I was not notified nor was I told by the supervisor in the office that I no longer had access to the courses I had already paid for. I left my house to take this course in the bitter cold weather and had not seat when I arrived, 2 nights out of the 4. I want my money back and someone needs to warn this woman, you don't talk to people like she did and still have a job.
On 2/1/09 I went to Jackson Hewitt in Salem for them to prepare my taxes. I informed the lady that I need money as quick as possible and that is why I was there, normally I file myself on line and receive them in 2 weeks. Well after 2 hours and over $400 in fees I chose to go with the money now, which I was to receive $962 within 1 hour on the ipower credit card. So 3 days later the $962 is still not on the card and they are now telling me they do not know when it is going to be there. My return has been accepted by the IRS and yet the bank refuses to send the money. I want something done about this. People go there to receive their money faster than if they could do it themselves and for them to be done by a professional that knows what they are doing. Well the preparer asked me if she could put my state on hold because she did not know how to do them! My disconnect notice for the electric was unable to be paid in full as well as other bills such as my daughter's daycare costs.
My son went to Walmart - Jackson Hewitt office to have his taxes prepared. He requires only the EZform due to being single - owns nothing - rents a home - no children. One place of employment - one W2. When asked how much it would cost the clerk told him it depended on the amount of forms then proceeded on with the tax preparation. When it was completed the clerk advised him that he would get back $486.00 and the cost of the preparation was $186.00? My son and husband thought that was outragious to pay almost half of the total return for the preparation so they asked the clerk to cancel the process. He was charged $25.00 for the cancellation. This to us is a scam! I have gotten our entire family of 4's taxes done in the past (April 2008) which included itemizing deductions, the PA state return, local returns by a local CPA and the cost was about the same as Jackson Hewitt was charging for ONE EZ Form. This company should be investigated as their practices appear to be similar to all those executives who have brought our country to the dire straits that it is now in.
I filed my taxes 1/29/09. Received my tax money on 1/30/09. I had to use the ipower card because I got the $300 holiday loan. I was told about the fees that came from the loan at that time but I wasn't told about the $12 additional fee at the time of my filing. Whatever.... I'm not going to cry over $12 however.... my experience with this card has been the WORST experience of my life! First it took me 3 days and a phone call to my local Jackson Hewitt office to figure out how to get my PIN# on my card. Their automated system is very deceiving and confusing. I finally get my PIN# and go to the bank to withdraw money to put in my bank account. I go to the ATM and it wont pull out the money so I go to another and same thing; I cancelled both transaction and go on with my day. Well, the money pulled from my ipower card along with all the fees. I called the bank and spoke with the ATM tech who tried to help me. We were on the phone for just about 2 hours and all we discovered was that it is impossible to get an actual person with the cc company. I cant get the bank to help me until I file a report with the cc company and you cant file a report unless you talk to someone or fax all your information over and in 2 days they will process the request. I dont have 2 days! I am so angry right now! How can you have a customer service line with out agents to answer calls! I have called 4 times and each time I have been placed on hold for over 20 minutes; and after that Im told there is no customer service agent to help and that I have to wait for my rapid refund to be placed on my card before an agent will help me. I GOT MY MONEY LAST WEEK! The Jackson Hewitt person was no help; she basically told me sorry about you luck - a lot of people are having this problem and we dont have any phone number for the cc company WE use! It wasnt until I started yelling at her that she gave us her regional managers number to call. So we get a hold of her and she starts arguing with the technical support man I have on the phone with me; she tells him he has to file a report. After they go rounds I am told from the regional manager that someone will call me back. After and hour I called Jackson Hewitt back and they acted surprised that I was waiting for a call back form them. They gave me a fax number that I already had. As for this ipower card DONT DO IT! Not only will I NOT do this whole ipower card again, I will NEVER deal with Jackson Hewitt again and I will make sure EVERY person I come in contact with knows about this experience! I cant get anyone to help me get my money back, the Jackson Hewitt Regional Manager basically told me to wait and see; maybe my money will be there soon!
I went to file my taxes like i do every year with jackson hewitt and the the guy totally messed me up. last month i had filed for a loan and they gave me the i power card. well when i went last night i told the guy that i wanted rapid refund you know within 24 hours and load the money to my card. at the end he told me the wrong ammount that i was getting back and now today my money is still not loaded. so i called and they told me he had put it under the 8 to 15 days. that is not what i wanted and he had told me the money will be on there today. well its not. to top it all off i had to wait five hours to even get my taxes done. the physical damage that resulted is now i am broke and have to wait. if i knew this was going to happen i would have filed them myself not paying them a dime. so now i will be late on rent and have no money for food or anything. thanks you wont have me come back next year.
I went to Jackson Hewitt to have my taxes done and it was a HUGE mistake. No one in the office had a clue what they were doing. It was like the blind leading the blind. I had to walk them through the self explainatiry process of how to activate an iPower card and I know absolutely squat about filing taxes. I told the lady that I was filing head of household as I do every year. I was expecting around $6500 back and was told that I would only receive $1500. I question the two people ther at length and was given a vague answer. They filed the tax return and 2 days later was suppossed to receive $560. of which I only received $253. The same day I found out that they had messed up and had accidently put no in a box that was suppossed to be checked yes and had messed up to the tune of $5000. Now I have to wait 30 days to file an ammendment and then wait another 3-6 months before I will receive the balance of what is owed to me. I feel that they should have returned my filing fees for their mistakes. As for the discrepancy with the $560. the only thing that they could say was I don't know. Jackson Hewitt is awful and should not have untrained employees in their offices playing around with peoples Federal Income Taxes. This wa not a small mistake and the explainations are worse than nothing, I am very upset about this mistake and even calling corporate was given the I'll have a supervisor call you tomorrow routine. With the money they are making off of us as the consumer you would think they someone would get you a supervisor immediately to rectify the situation. I flat out told the other people in the office waiting to leave and to go somewhere else to have their taxes done. I also told the people working there that I would never be back to their organization. The economic consequences are devastating to me. My 17 year old daughter has a brain tumor and I have had to take a lot of time off recently to take her to doctors and hospitals and these are some of the most inconsiderate, uncaring people I have ever had the misfortune of dealing with.
On Dec. 20, 2008,I got a flier from Jackson Hewitt, who has been doing my taxes for over 10 years. If I wanted some extra money for Christmas, I could get a loan that would be paid back from my tax refund. I had gotten Holiday Loans previously, so I assumed it was the same thing. The office on East Bay was not open, so I went to the one on First St. in St. Pete., FL. The lady who processed my application from my last paystub. She gave me a Visa debit card that said "Reloadable Debit Card" from IPower and said that I qualified for $500. She also said the fees would come out of the money going to the IPower card, and 500 would come out of my tax refund. My 500 turned out to be only 423. The only papers She gave me at the time was card member agreement that detailed the most outrageous fees. I was too late to rescind by then because the money was on the card. I got my W-2s on Jan 11, and went to Jackson Hewitt on East Bay to process my return. Ms. S told me afterward that my return would not be accepted by the IRS until Jan 15th and she made me an appointment to come in and sign the paperwork at 11:00am on Fri. Jan 15th to receive my refund. It turned out that I was only there to sign the Refund Anticipation Loan papers and be told the money would have to go on the IPower card. When I protested, I was told that was what I agreed to. I never got papers that said that. Never heard that from the Fist St. office, but I went with the 24 hour process and agreed to the exhorbitant fees so I could help my daughter pay for a car. (the card was not loaded until the following Monday, Dr.King Day and I could not withdraw money from the bank. Tuesday, the IPower card charged my 67.50 to remove cash from the card because it only would allow a "cash advance". How do you charge for a cash advance card from a reloadable debit card that doesn't even have your name on it.?) When I saw the prepared return, I told Ms. S that it was not accurate. Someone had put that I got a 300 stimulus check when I had gotten 1200. As much as I stood my ground about this, Ms. S said that the IRS would fix it if it was wrong. I complained that I did not want to have a record of filing bad returns and would be just as happy if it was less as long as it was accurate. Well, to shorten, the amount of money put on the card was 6192. My return was 8251. I called Ms. S and she was very condescending and halfway rude and said I just didn't understand the process and I should "trust" her. I didn't get my 25 off the tax prep (for having them done at First St.), the fees don't add up, basically, I was told it is what it is. Tried to contact Jackson Hewitt corporate office and was told I would get a call back with 5 days (??). No call back...their phones are answered overseas, hmmm. Today, 2-1-09 I called the East Bay office at 3:30 to 4:00and waited until 7:45 for a call back. It was Ms. S. I asked her to review the figures on my tax form because they didn't make sense. She said it wasn't their fault and they couldn't force the Gov't. to give me money. I argued with her over this and told what the card charged me to take out my own cash. She said it wasn't their fault, it was the bank's. When I told her that I should not have been charged for a 24 hour refund, she said it wasn't their fault. The computers had a glitch and lots of people didn't get their money. (The Jackson Hewitt computers had the glitch, or so I was told by them.) She also said that they (Hewitt)were telling customers that the fees were high and not to use them...if so, then it was already too late. The commitment to IPower was already made. She also said very nastily that I applied for the card because I was "broke". I said that wasn't so and she asked me what I needed the money for, then. I told her it was not her business what I wanted the money for and insisted that she review my return for errors. She said that I had to come in...only then would they look at it. I can't trust her and don't know what to do.
I filed my taxes at this local office listed, on January 30th 2009. I choose the one day loan offered to be direct deposited into my account on Monday according to the tax preparer. But come Monday morning I called my bank, checked online also they saw nothing pending for my tax retun. So from there all morning and afternoon I got the run around as to where my check was I called the Jackson Hewitt office here in my town, the Santa Barbara Bank in California, later on the IRS. Through all of this I was informed that this type of one day loan as a direct deposit is being offered by Jackson Hewitt this year for the first time ever. Also by the SBB and later Jackson Hewitt I was told that the loan process for this could take up to one to three business days. Personally I think this is a bunch of bull, because during the filing process nobody told us about the timeframe until Monday morning. I paid a total of $325.00 in fees to get my tax check in one day in which did not happen, nobody had any answers as to why I was not told and what could be done to correct their mess up. I have filed my taxes lots of years with Jackson Hewitt before now, have never had any problems, my choice has always been one day loan, got it on the scheduled day. I am a very unhappy customer this year because I have been done wrong and this company is not fessing up to their workers mistake, just avoiding my calls, lying saying I will receive a call back in which never happened. What I would like to have taken place on this matter is for a manager or even headquarters to step in take charge and refund my fees that were taken out for the one day loan being that it was not in my account on the day stated by the tax preparer eventhough she said she informed me of the number of days it would take. If I was made aware of the 1-3 days I would have taken the option of a paper check like the many years before. My services were unfair, not taken seriously, got pushed around just to get nothing resolved so I feel I am entitled to my refund plus the fees that was took. I also have filed a complaint with the BBB for this office my plan is to warn people of how bad their services can be, get so be careful with filing with any Jackson Hewitt office. If you can file your own taxes at least then you know they were done correctly and are made aware of any hidden fine print in which was not mentioned anywhere in my paperwork just on their computer screen that got looked over in our case. Also if you are undecided on who to file with do some research because I sure wish I did. This company has lots of lawsuits and complaints on the web, so be careful, if you have time read them carefully before choosing them. If something can be further done to this office I am interested to discuss every detail. The damage this caused was my bills not getting paid on time, having to find other sources to get money to last until I get my check in which nobody knows or just not telling me. I have bills and children to take care just like the next person which is hard to do without having money.
on 1-30-09 i got my taxes done but i wasn't please with the young lady not claimming everything i had on my form. I ask to speak to the manager and she claim she would make the corrections. she then realize that the young lady had send them off. and told me that i had to file an addemendom. on 1-31. i got a call from jackson hewitt's office claimming that the i.r.s. had refuse my refund and i need to come in and make the correction. i was so happy, i then told her no because i wanted to go somewhere else.i told her i wasn't please with them. they had made so many mistakes. she told me to come in and talk to them. i told her i'll be there to pick up my paper work. on monday i came in to pick up my paper work and discovered that they had made the corrections on that sunday and refiled them. the manager said she was sorry and they would not charge me any fees. and they would make the necessary corections. just then a nother worker claimming to be the owner grap my paper work and yeild out who the hell is Saralyn W. and he repeated it. I responded I am she but don't approch me with that tone. He took my pappers and headed for the door and then down the street. i start yell stop don't take my personal bussiness out of the builded. and he kept walking. i called the police. and told they my story. the police responded that he was moving my paper to safe location. I told the police that i didn't sign all the paper work and i had not agree to the corrections. but jackson hewitt lied and said i did. i was disrespected. i was lied too. my personal files were taken out of the office with out my consent.i wasn't treated with respect. i felt threathen.
For my 2007 taxes I went to Jackson Hewitt. That year I had a W2 and a 1099. I gave the preparer all my information. It took her three times to actually do my taxes. Over an hour later I'm out of there and I get my refund check in 8 days. This december I get a letter from the IRS saying I owe them 900 dollars for not including my 1099. I thought this had to be a mistake. I go to the Jackson Hewitt franchise office take in my taxes from the last year and the letter from the IRS. The lady said she would have to go to the warehouse where they keep all the old tax files. Two weeks later I call back and the lady tells me that they did find the 1099 attached to my tax file. The lady that I talked to said since I didn't purchase the gold guarantee that there was nothing that they could do. I then explained that I was never told about the gold guarantee. She then told me there was nothing she could do but refund me the for my taxes being done there, have them done there this year for free, and refund me for the penalties. This has been over two weeks now. No check in the mail and no word back from the lady. So now I owe the IRS 900 dollars because they didn't respond to me in time and I have the penatlties.
My husband and I went in to taxs as we did last year. they went through the process and when it got to the end to tell us how we could get our money, we said the same as last year a check now for part and the rest the next day, Oh we do it different now lets see if you qulifiy for the money now, he cam back and said our refund was not larg enough. over 1200 is not large, then he said he would she if we quilify for 1 day check, I call the next morning at 9:30 the lady said it is still proccessing check back in the afternoon I called back a man answered and said still processing so I said nothing will change today and he said no, I said then why did the lady tell me to call back. This place is not professional at all now I paid all this money for money now and may have to wait 8 days for the first check and 8 more for the second. the place is making money and ripping off the poor who need it. I need it to catch up my car payment.
We've done our taxes with Jackson Hewitt for several years, so going back there on January 30th 2009 at 7pm we never thought twice about it. We applyed for the RAL since that is the way we've done it since they've offered it. Nothing on the paper work or in the session ever stated that the RAL has to be approved through the bank based on YOUR CREDIT. I found out in the last day or so that this year you have to have a 750 credit rating. WHAT? Who in this day and time has anything near that. Anyhow the agent NEVER once stated that the monies might not be available for 10-15 days even though I was paying 340 dollars for the 1-2 day loan. Jackson Hewitt also offers a 1 hour loan...well they can tell you right then if you are approved for that...so in my thinking they should be able to tell you if your approved for the RAL through the bank RIGHT? Well I guess not since they won't even disclose to you that you are more than likley not going to get your monies for weeks even though your paying and requesting the RAL! So will I go to Jackson Hewitt next year....NO! They should be shut down.There should be some law against this. False Advertisment or something. How with the IRS as strict as they are can a company that deals with the IRS indirectly be able to scam the tax payers like this. I researched this an have found that there are TONS of people who have been dealing with this same thing this year...and it is not just through Jackson Hewitt. Start swamping the news stations and radio stations about this so maybe at least one person will be saved the headache.
I went and got my taxes prepared at Jackson Hewitt office on 1/26/2009 and was aprroved for a Money Now Loan. I got the 1,000 that day and waited 24 hours for the rest to be loaded on the card. NO MONEY. Called the next day and was told that the IRS hadn't approved it yet and would be another 1-2 days. THen get a call from a lady the next morning saying she has been trying to file it and the IRS keeps kicking it back saying my almost 2 yo daughter's SSN is invalid and could I bring a copy of my last years return to check what they put in last year. I asked doesn't she have a copy and she said it is probably boxed up at another office. I cant' find mine and now have to wait and call IRS on Monday to figure out the problem. Obviously the person that filed my return from last year must have put in the number wrong so now since they put it in correctly this year, its invalid to the IRS. Isn't their someone who checks the freaking SSN, both the tax office and the IRS. I am frustrated because I had promised people money that I owe now have to wait because of someone else's mistake. I should have known better because when I went in that day to file there was someone else complaining about their taxes were done wrong and making a big scene about it. Just frustrated and want my money NOW the way I paid for it.
I filed my taxes with Jackson Hewitt on Jan 16th and paid over 300 dollars for their AR return which took 8 to 15 days. now sitting on Day 16 I call ed the office where I filed to see what was going on and was told They didn't know where my money was. I called to speak to a regional manager and was told I could not speak which her. So I asked for the banks number where Jackson Hewitt has their loans through, upon calling Santa Barbara Bank I found that I would not be receiving my loan until after 21 days. WHAT A LIE! This company is HORRIBLE its complete misrepresentation. now they wont refund my money that I paid them to do my taxes. if not all of it I feel I should be giving some kind of credit, but you know how it is with LIARS and CHEATS. if they can't one way they'll get you another. I say to anyone thinking of using this company STAY AWAY! Their horrible and not to mention rude, but hey its not their money why do they care?
I went with my son to file his income taxes for 2008. He had one W-2,and did not itemize. The cost was $312.00- Last year it was $100.00 This is robbery in the first degree. I will never set foot in Jackson-Hewitt Agency again. Trust me.
My husband and I used Jackson Hewitt last year for our tax service. First off they did not send the money to the state like they said they would and we ended up having to pay our state taxes late. Second this year they have us on some crazy calling list that calls our house every day starting around 8 or 8:30 in the morning. One day they called five times, my husband called to remove our name from the list. I gave it a couple of days (still receiving phone calls) and called again to remove our name from the list. Now today they are still calling. How do I get them to stop?
Went to Jackson Hewitt like I have For the past few years I did get a Christmas loan for $300 so i knew I had to use the Ipower card. I went in and was denied the next dya the 3-4 day and was told I had to wait for the IRS to release the funds. I could have saved hundreds of dollars and filed myself. I only went there because I thought I was getting the next day loan. I was only willing to pay $600 in fees because of needing the money so badly. Noone can explain to me why I cant get the money sooner. The Ipower card in the mean time is adding intrest to the loan. The ipower card is a horrible mess I dont recommend it to anyone. file yourself and get the money back in the same amount of time or less another 2 weeks of no vehicle with 4 kids. I have been looking forward to getting a car this month. I will be writing a check for rent hoping it doesnt bounce before the taxes come
I went to Jackson Hewitt on the 27 of Jan. of 2009. The lady was very nice and explained things as she went. I did not quilify for the loan prosses and was told I am accepted for the 24 hr deposit. and then after I accepted the 24 hr with the out ragous fees. and the prosses started, I asked about the 24 hr service and that is when she dropped the ball that if the 24 hr service does not go through then I have to wait 8 to 15 days. I am very up set about having to wait when I was told my money would be deposited in 24 hrs. I always used H&R block and they tell me my refund will be deposited in 3 days and it is done so. No run around or anything. This is a big let down when someone refered me to Jackson Hewitt and I put trust in the friend. I will not make the same mistake next year. I was supose to pay my trusting friend the money I owe for the car I am buying from him on the 1st of Feb. and not I have to call and tell that trusting friend that I have to wait because Jackson Hewitt told false information until the complete application of taxes was done then told the rest of the story.
During my visit to the office on January 13, 2009, I was told by the representative after my preparation of taxes that my forms will not be submitted until my W-2s are received. I was then told that for the time being that I qualified for a loan of $300.00 which will be loaded on an i power card. Initially I told the reperesentative no, but she explained to me that although it is not mandatory to get the card it would be advised if I needed some small money on that day. I asked her about the fees and read the disclosure of the card in the store with her. There was nothing stated regarding a fee for each and every transaction made on the card. I was informed by her that I could go to Bank of America and withdraw all of my funds at no charge. The disclosre of the loan that she told be was that there would be a $35.00 fee for loading the card. She also explained that I had to option to load my entire refund on the card as direct deposit. I told her that I was not doing that because I have my own account with a bank. I will come and pick up my check as normal when I do decide to file my taxes. We discussed this card for minutes until I decided to get the loan amount. After processing I learned that my fees were double the amount we discussed. I was flabbergasted at the fact that the representative and I discussed these fees and never once did she disclose the extra fees. I told her that I did not want the loan and she began to tell me that it was too late and that the funds were already on the card. When I receive my income taxes, Jackson Hewitt will automatically deduct the loan amount from my refund. The amount I signed for that will be deducted is #301.01. On January 26, 2009 I visited the office again to turn in my W-2s for a refund submittal. This time I spoke with a lovely and respectful woman who informed me that since I received the loan I had no option of how I want to recieve my refund. She insisted that I had to get my refund on the i Power card only. I told her that I do not want it that way and this is what I told the other young lady as well. I began to tell her that the fees are too much and rediculous. She then began to explain to me that the card is a gimmic and that her boss told them to push the product regardless. She said she had receivd so many complaints about the card and will not use Jackson Hewitt's services herself. She apologized repeatedly to me for not being disclosed of the truths about the service of Jackson Hewitt. She told me that if I decided not to file with them I had to come into the store and of course pay the loan amount that I borrowed and pay a $70.00 tax preparation fee. How rediculous this is for me. I know that I have to pay the loan back, which is no problem. The problem was that the loan amount that was calculated within my refund amount came out to be eight dollars more that the original amount that I signed for. She could not explain to me where the difference came from. Jackson Hewitt has a way of doing business with crooked companies that charge their customers unnecessary fees twice for the same service. I need to know who I can talk to about bringing up a legitimate lawsuit against the finance company as well as Jackson Hewitt. This is rediculous and costly. Please direct me to the necessary department who will be able to assist me in this matter. The economic damage is that I have to use my refund money to get some of my money off the card.
I had problems with Jackson Hewit from the begining, I was waiting for my money to come in and be delivered and weeks had passed so I called and to only find out that my tax preparer had typed in the wrong account number. So i had to follow up with my bank to make sure that it was not giving to someone else. After that happened again so i filed a complaint with Jh because it was non sense along with that i finally recieved my federal taxs back but i never recieved my state taxes and still yet to have recieved it. after i complained abou that the company was suppose to make back contact with me and the manager of the office refused to give me corporate number she said they were busy and she would contact them and have them contact me again which i still yet haven't heard from JH. Now it is 2009 and when preparing to file agian i recieve a letter from the IRS stating that me and my husband did not include all of our income. So we pulled out our folder from 2008 when we filed with them and we had all of ou w2's inthe fold and made sure that we handed them to the tax preparer but the tax preparer did not include all of our income so we owe the IRS $1600. Because our tax preparer did not do our taxing the right way. when we filed we made sure we got the protection gold cerificate from JH that is suppose to protect you if the tax preparer messes up your taxes and you end up owing. so my husband and i went to JH and complained about what had ahpped and the said there was nothing they can do. my husband and i owe the IRS $1600 because Jackson Hewit did not complete our taxes with all the correct information that my husband and i have provided to them. Which is one out of 3 mistakes they have made while preparing our taxes in february 2008.
On Jan. 13, 2009, my husband and I went into the Jackson Hewitt office to apply for the RAL. When we walked in we informed the lady what we wanted, and gave her the ONE W-2 and our military i.d. She proceeded to do our taxes and when the amount of the return came up I told her that was exactly what I had figured. She asked if I do taxes, and I informed her that I knew how we were just wanting to get our money now. When it came time to pick which loan we wanted we told her the RAL again and she then informs us that last year they wouldn't allow the military to get it, but she would try anyway. We couldn't get it simply because my husband is in the military. She told us that the only option we had was to get our money back in 8-15 days. She then told us our money would be deposited into our bank account by 1/23/09. My husband looked at me and asked if I just wanted to do it and save ourselves the fee. I did not know that it was not to late to go back. I told him that. She was sitting right in front of us as we were discussing this. When my husband looked at her for a answer she just looked away. Since we thought that we couldn't go back we went ahead and filed them. On our way home I was looking over the 300 dollar fee. There was a 20 dollar purchase for something. I asked my husband if he had bought anything and he said No. She had put the Gold Guarantee on our return and didn't even ask us if we wanted it or explain it to us. I called the next day to just have the void it out and they informed that they had already sent it to the irs. The irs didn't get it until 1/16/08. I called customer service and couldn't get a person that could explain anything to me. All they did was give me the number to the store. My husband spoke to the manager and she said that we were able to get our 20 dollars back (how nice of them) after the irs accepts our return. They couldn't void it out unless the irs denied it. Well the irs finally accepted it on 1/18/09. On the 23 we still hadn't recieved any funds. I called the district manager. He told me that the lady must have made a mistake that we weren't suppose to get our money til possible this coming Friday the 30. When I informed him that we felt like we had been taken advantage of he said that he was sorry. She intentionally did not tell us when we first told her we were military and we wanted the RAL that we couldn't get it. I just not sure that they don't get a commission off of the returns. It's very sad that people take advantage of those who fight for their freedom. We will NEVER do business with them again. We really didn't have the 300 dollars in fees to pay them. We had told the bank with our car loan that we would get them paid up on the 23rd. Now we don't know for sure when we are going to get it. Thankfully our bank is working with us.
I am getting nervous. I didnt do my homework and went with Jackson Hewitt for my taxes this year. They have comercials and a professional looking company. I am having similiar problems as a lot of other people it seems. I filed my tax 1/26/09 and paid to get my Taxes back in 1 day. I have called and called to activate my card. I cant even get that far because it tells me that the number does not match any user information? I called Jackson Hewitt they said they had a call from the bank that they had put some thing in the computer wrong but they had fixed it and all should be fine and I should still get my money in 1 day. Its been 1 day and I still cant even activate my card! I have tried to call and call and at this point I cant get ahole of anyone not the bank not the Icard not Jackson Hewitt! I keep a very tight budget but when I was told I would have my return in 1 day I told my husband it was ok to spend the money we had because we would have our taxes in 24hrs. We cant even put gas in our car and payday is a week away! For paying $300 to have my taxes done you think they could do it right or at least give me some personal attention to resolve my problem.
Lady did taxes wrong. Pd. for 1-3 day's and now it's been 4. Ask for my tax's back and said I had to pay 50.00. Will never go back to Jackson Hewitt. nothing really, just the aggervation of being lied to and holding on the phone for more than 26 min at a time. Gen. Mang./Owner would not even pick the phone up to talk to me. Never will I recommend or GO BACK! Thanks for trying to help me.
My husband and I went into our local Walmart Supercenter to get our taxes prepared at Jackson Hewitt on 1/24/2009. We were told that we were eligible for an extra $278 because I had a child in September 2008 and it's money I should have received with the stimulus money that we received. So we filed for the 1 day return. So Sunday I called Jackson Hewitt 3 times looking for our money. She said that she was having a problem with the computer printing our check. (This was around 10:30am) So finally around 2:30pm she called me back and stated we were denied for the 1 day through there bank. And we have to call them to find out why. The bank explained to us, that our 'wonderful' government wants to wait to give us our money due to the extra $278 we are receiving. So we then called Jackson Hewitt back and explained this to the same lady that prepared our taxes. She said she didn't know about this. Now if you work for a business that deals with Taxes, you should know everything that is going on. This really upsets me. So now we have to wait till at least 2/6/2009 before we will get our money. We have no idea how are money is going to come to us. Through the mail in the office or even through one of those Jackson Hewitt Cards that I have heard so much 'good' reviews of. And of course, the lady at Jackson Hewitt had no idea what was going to happen with our money either. So here we sit, wondering how and when we will be receiving our money.
I went their earlier in January trying to get a money now loan with my last paystub. I knew it was based on your credit so I might be denied. I was denied for it but understood. I went back with my W-2 knowing that I was actually filing. This was later on in january about 3 weeks. I was so excited that I was able to file and it was electronic so it would process quicker. Now I went in and sat down with the lady. She was very nice but did not explain things very well. I asked her which option besides the one I had already tried would be the quickest way to get my refund and she said "The RAL option". RAL is the refund anticipation loan. I told her I didnt care about the fees but I need the money. I kept asking her if she was for sure I would get my check the next day. I was so nervous I asked like every few minutes. She insited yes so I felt relieved. The next morning when they opened I called to see if the IRS faxed acknowledgments to their office for E-file returns. I was told I had to wait because they were with other customers. I waited like two hours after they opened and finally got a phone call......................saying I was unapproved for the RAL. Now the lady that did my return never told me it was credit based. And she made it out to be that I was getting the check the next morning! I had such high hopes I was going to get my financial situation figured out one I got my refund. I was so irritated I called back to see if I could cancel the return and file it myself online for free and get it direct deposit in 8-15 days. They said they couldn't because it was already in the IRS hands. So I went on asking why I was unapproved for the RAL and she gave me a number. All it said was I was unapproved because of something on my return! Now I don't have prefect credit, but my boyfriend got approved for the RAL and the lady told him 1-3 days before it direct deposited into his account. She didn't even specify if it was regular days or business days. He has horrible credit and he was approved. Now what could be on my return that makes it not approvable? Did Jackson Hewitt screw up? I really needed the money the fastest way and honestly JAckson Hewitt screwed me out of money and time. If I filed online I could have had the money within this week. Now I have to wait till the second week of January and still have to pay the moneysuckers fees. I will never go through them again! I will just file online and never pay those outrageous fees again! They are liars! They lied to me and my boyfriend! I wonder who else they lied to!
They have been taking money from my account a retirement fund. I've never taking a penny out and it's over 6,000.00. What can I do I'm 76 years old and that was all my saving.
The Jackson Hewitt iPower card is backed by an organization that provides no customer service to you and yet expects you to trust them to handle your money. Even after loading money on to the card, I have not been able to get access to customer service by either phone or through the website, and cannot get my current issue of how to access my account online after having registered more than a month ago. The site keeps sending me to the automated voice system at the 866 customer service number, which in turn tells me I cannot receive customer serivce. I have filed a formal complaint through the Better Business Bureau office of W Georgia in Columbus, and advise that customers of Jackson Hewitt use more reliable types of prepaid debit purchased through well known retailers to receive their tax refunds and not to trust them to this kind of scam artist operating under the umbrella of a well-known company name. The money that I loaded on the card is lost, and even though the automated system lists it as my balance, I cannot use the card or receive customer service explaining why I cannot use the card. A formal complaint has been filed, and I will not be doing business with Jackson Hewitt again.
Like everyone else nowdays, I need my tax return to catch up on bills since I lost my job. I went to the local JH office on 1/16/09 and was told since my employer 1099's me I was not eligible for a RAL and would have to get an AR refund, I didn't know exactly what that was at the time. She said that since I was filing on the first day refunds were being accepted, I could expect my check in about a week, and charged me over 300.00 for the return. I asked about direct deposit since I always did it that way with turbo tax but she said no, that way would be even longer. Well, its been a week. After calling their check line I am told it will be 8 to 15 days before I see my check. I called the office and the impatient lady told me that it was correct and you cannot count weekends in that. I told her that I was told a week and she said that she couldn't tell me anything else and that I must have misunderstood the preparer. Hmmm I wrote on my envelope what she said and even the date it was expected in front of her when she told me it. I dont think I misunderstood, I just think they ripped me off! WHAT A JOKE! Im sure they arent waiting 15 days to get my 300+ in fees! The bad thing is according to the IRS website, my refund isn't due until Feb 3. If I had used turbotax, it would have been direct deposited in my account 1/30 and would have cost me $74.00! Way to go LIERS Because of this, I am unable to make my committment to my morgage company to get my house out of foreclosure. I am also unable to pay my car insurance.
I filed my taxes on Saturday Jan. 17, 2009 at 9:00 am. I requested the 24 hour direct deposit option, since the preparer explained the differences and assured me that it wouldnt cost more. She also assured me that the money would be in my account on Monday Jan. 19.2009 regardless of the fact that it was a holiday. She told me that I would get $2140 and change in 24 hours and another 300 in three weeks. I asked her if I would get a refund on the 24 hour service if it wasnt in there on Monday and she told me yes. I asked her what I would need to do in that case and she told me that it would be added back to the deposited amount. I paid right at $300 in fees to them and when I questioned why it cost so much, she told me that the software automatically generates the amount and they have no control over how much the services are and that it depends on how many W-2s you have and how much you are getting back (I only had one). She showed me the screen and explained what I would get back Monday came and there was no money. Wednesday (4 days later) I received a deposit of just over $1800. I am so angry she never once mentioned I would only get this amount, and it wasnt on the monitor when she explained what I would get back. My friend went to another location and only paid $130 for fees and had 2 W2s and received more money back. Somethings not right with this company. I promised my landord that I would have the money by the 19th. I owed $2149 and change for rent and was so excited that I would finally get caught up, but the amount I received was less than what I was promised and I didn't receive it until the 21st.
I filed my return on 1/20/09. First of all something told me the lady that was helping me was very inexpierenced. I filed the RAL. The next day I called to ck the status and they said my paperwork was rejected by the IRS. I was told differnent stories about what happend. So the manger says she was going to the office to look over my paperwork and would resubmit it. She clais there were no errors to her knowlege and just re sent it. Guess what! It was rejected again the follwing day! Now I am fed up, I want to know what happen, they are toggling with my money and could possibly put me in jepordy with the IRS. After, making a dozen phone calls to the local office, customer service, filing a claim and calling a different office, a lady at another office told me that they were submitting the wrong form. Again, the manager says she will fix the form and resend it for the 3rd time that I know of. I call again several hours later and get more stories. Now they say there is something wrong with my itemizing. I can not trust them anymore and I want to take my taxes somewhere else. So I go up to the office and tell the Regional Manager (so she claims) that I will not allow them to resubmit my taxes to the IRS anymore and that I want my forms back. Her answers back to me is that I will have to wait till the next day, so she can go pick up my paperwork from the Auditor's. If there is anyone that can, PLEASE HELP! What is going on, these are my taxes, why do I feel they are keeping information from me? Thank you So far I have lost 48 hours tomorrow will make the 3rd day and I still have to get my paperwork and try to go somewhere else.
I filed my taxes with Jackson Hewitt on 1/16/2009 and i applied for the RAL loan. I had come in a couple of weeks before and had gotten the $500 loan with my last check stub (after fees it was around $413, they charge you for tax preperation then charge you again for the same thing when you return) i was very upset when i learned that i had no other choice than to have my money loaded on that stupid Ipower card which i had so many problems with (it took them forever to load the money, i got overcharged for gas and it takes forever just to speak with anyone DONT GET THIS CARD!) they said since i had accepted the first loan that there was no other option but to use that card again which i was not told the first time i came in. anyways i applied for the RAL and was told i would get my money on monday but no later than tuesday, well that didnt happen and i had to call the ipower card company and they said to call Republic Bank (they are the new bank they are using this year). well i find out that my application for the RAL was denied and was not given a reason as they said they had to mail the reason to me to my old address that the tax preparer insisted that i use for their bank purposes. Now im told i have to wait an extra 8-15 days to get my return or untill the IRS approves and releases the check. I paid almost $400 for a loan i did not get and in the 10 years i have done my taxes with Jackson Hewitt i have never been denied for the RAL. Last year i filed my taxes with them i applied for the money now loan where you get your check in a hour and i waited over 3 hours for a check only to find out the dumb lady who had never done a tax return before (she was in training which i didnt know) sent my stupid refund to the irs another way so i had to wait 2 weeks for my return! DO NOT GO TO JACKSON HEWITT! you would have better luck doing it yourself!
I took my last check stubs to Jackson Hewitt to file my taxes for 2006. I handed all of my w2s and information on my health savings account over to the representative. She seemed puzzled on what to do with the savings account and then I had one w2 where they didnt take any federal taxes out because I hadnt made enough. She handed the w2 and the savings account statement back to me telling me I didnt need to include these on my return. I dont know anything about this, thats why I go to someone else to do my taxes. Anyway I received a letter four months later from the IRS saying I owe 1100.00 in penalties because I failed to file one w2 and my health savings account. I later went back to Jackson Hewitt because I bought the Gold Guarantee thinking they would stand behind their mistakes, I spoke with the manager and told her what happened. She told me I should have known I had to pay taxes on these items and they were not responsible for this.
My husband and I filed our taxes with Jackson Hewitt for the first time this year and were denied for the MNL, but were told we would get the RAL. That was January 16, 2009, it is now January 21, 2009 and the IRS isn't even showing that they have received my taxes and I have Jackson Hewitt employees telling me and my husband that we were denied the RAL. We have had several conversations with several different employees and have always gotten a different answer. We finally asked for a manager and were told that they couldn't give out the number, but the manager would call within 24 hours. Well, 23.5 hours later they called back and the manager argued with my husband about what we were told. My husband is about to loose his business because we can't pay the rent without this money.
I went in on Monday January 19 2009 about 6:30 PM This lady did my income tax, I pay for my service next day refund, they gave me the Ipower card I told her since I file my taxes single, she ask me if I receive the stimulus check I said yes 300.00, she put 0, I pay to you and IRS more than 200.00 because I had an emergency and I needed the money, and she did this mistake, they call me till next day in the afternoon, and said that I had to go back to the office because the info I had given did not match, I dont hava car , I lost hrs of work just because of her mistake Lost time from work, need money to pay bills, had to be asking for a ride becasue I dont have a car, and I was waiting for my money, thats why I decided to do it for the first time like this next day.
Been with JHewitt for 7-8 years, Saturday the 17th of Jan. went to the same place where I go, different person since I've been with Jackson Hewitt, was told the money would be in my IPower card with 1-3 business days, went back 3 days later, and was told the RAL was declined and automatically put to 5-18 days available, call the manager and nobody at the main office would take ownership of the situation, what kind of customer service do the get trained on? Just get people money only? I'm disappointed with Jackson Hewitt. I will definetly go somewhere after this year.
I did my 2007 tax at Jackson Hewitt in Gilroy CA. They have a drop off service that i thought was convenient at the time for working parents, where you take your privies taxes with your w-2 form and they call you when everything is ready to sign. so when i went in a young girl help me she assured me they were done correctly, i signed with out having anything being explain to me except that i was getting i great refund. now 1/20/2009 i have received a letter from the IRS that im am being penalized for 5,063 because of Jackson Hewitt mistake they reported my income 19,353 less then it really was. after speaking with the IRS we figured out that the seasonal worker that did my taxes used 1 of my w-2 forms from the year 2005 and there was 3 different places i worked that year. now 1/20/2009 i have receved a letter from the irs that im am being penaltized for 5,063 bescause of jackson hewitt mistake they reported my income 19,353 less then it really was. after speaking with the irs we figured out that the seasonal worker that did my taxes used 1 of my w-2 forms from the year 2005 and there was 3 different places i worked that year. i was spoke to the manager and owner in person of jackson hewitt and have been told they have to call me back i havent yet to receved a call i have been calling for one month now.
I was quoted a refund of $686.00 and the check amount was $477.90. When I asked about it they told me it was that I would receive the remainder seperately directly from the IRS at a later date. When I went to cash the check that I received it would not clear the machine at Wal Mart. I need to know what I can do about this.
i got the ral loan which is a one day loan 5 days laster. i paid for the one day not 5 day. they lye. please save yourself the trouble
I filed my taxes state and federal with Jackson Hewitt for the year 2007 I did not receive my State taxes in the amount of 284.00. I called the State of Missouri they informed me that my check was deposited into Jackson Hewitt's bank account. Jackson Hewitt informed me that maybe it was taken by the State of Missouri. I have never received a letter from the State of Missouri saying I owe them are anyone else. I have never received a letter from Jackson Hewitt stating why I haven't received my state taxes for 2007.
I was told I would receive my rapid fund within 1 day. It has been several days now and they still are going to charge me the rapid fees. The advertisement and the sales person failed to inform that the rapid may not work based on (first they said) the Bank, now IRS approval. This was revealed after I called in to check the status. This office has continually misrepresented its services and mislead me. I can't pay my rent on time and may be evicted without some immediate remedy.
On Jan 6, 2009, I took my last paycheck stub to Jackson Hewitt to apply for the IPower Loan being offered. I was promptly denied (even though I always get approved for an early loan every other year). I could'nt understand why I was not approved this year. There were no changes to my credit from last year, and I do not owe any debts. The tax preparer could not answer any of my questions, and only told me to return with my W2 on 1/16/09 and I would definetely get approved for the MNL. The tax preparer entered my info and then tried to set my up with a IPower card. He kept messing up and had to keep trying different cards. He spent 1 hour calling headquarters and the IPower customer service line for assistance. He finally advised me that all is well and gave me my paperwork and card and adv me that I will have $1000 on my card within an hour. While walking out to my car and going over all my paperwork, I noticed that it actually said that my MNL was denied. When I turned around and went back in the office, he told me that he did not see that and he apologized and told me that I would get the RAL. It is now 1/18/09 and there are no funds on my card and all the Jackson Hewitt Offices that I call are saying that the IRS has not accepted/processed (No one's) tax return, and they do not have a clue as to when to expect my refund but could be on my card on Monday. This is false advertisement on the part of Jackson Hewitt, H&R Block and Instant Tax Service. They are taking advantage of people.
I find it interesting that Jackson Hewitt does not have the same amount of refund listed as TaxAct from the IRS.gov website. I have run across several people that have reported that Jackson Hewitt is hundereds of dollars less refund than TaxAct from the IRS.gov website.So I personally looked into it and was shocked to find a $500.00 difference in refund anticipation with Jackson Hewitt being the lowest. Furthermore, it is a FREE service through the IRS.gov site as apossed to costing you $300-$500 for a Professional to prepare your taxes when all they do is read questions off the screen to you. So bottom line, if you can read, go to the IRS website and save money and get the most back.
I had an appointment on 1/16/09 at 8:00AM to file my W2 for 2008 tax year at the Jackson Hewitt located in Hesperia. I sat in this office for over 2 hours when I had already pre-filed last week. I should not have spent more than 30 minutes in this office this morning. The tax preparer named Billie, had to make at least 8 assistance calls to Megan (office manager)to prepare my taxes. At 10:00AM I was advised by Billie that she input that I was Active Military (which I am not-never been in any Miitary)thus I was denied bank services I requested. I went to the Victorville Office and spoke with office Manager Megan who didn't seem to care of my existance and would not even apologize for any of my inconvenience. Megan did not even look at my face and advised that there was nothing she could do for me and did not even offer any form of comp/discount for my time and troubles this morning. Time and travel 2 and a half hours. For the lack of training provided to the tax preparers, I should have been offered a customer satisfaction discount which I was'nt offered anything.
They made a mistake on my taxes $ refused to live up to there slogan to pay your tax if they make mistake. it cost me $1,328.00 in back taxs for 2006 $1,328.00 tax fee/$35.00 credit card fee/plus interest on card?
In january 2008, I went into Jackson & Hewitt to file my taxes for the first time with this company. I provided her with all my information, and she input this information into the computer, I later found out that she hadn't listed me as head of household , and she didn't list my son as a dependant under 18 years of age . I took these calculations to the Internal Revenue Service and they confirmed this problem.
I filed a tax return with Jackson Hewitt end of year 2007 and they put the wrong information on the papers, thus the IRS sent me notice stating I owe them almost 5k. Does Jackson Hewitt have any liability and can I pursue them for this balance? Also I was told that the IRS did an audit prior to releasing the return and they released the return without any notification of this oversight. Does the IRS have any liability since they internally missed this after doing audit? I now owe the IRS almost 5k and not only will this be on my credit report, but I will still have to pay the IRS and spend time and money to fight this with Jackson Hewitt for some sort of resolution. Bad credit and possibly lost wages if I have to file a law suit and miss work to address.
Received a advertisement in the mail regarding ipower card for the holiday from Jackson Hewitt. The flyer to me was false advertisment. First the telephone number for the nearest location was disconnected. I pulled up the internet site to call customer service and they stated that the office had not yet open but there was another office located near my home. I printed up the map to that location and went there last night. Well, there was no office at the Signature Lane address in Lexington Park MD. Which stated they were open from 12-7 pm. I drove over 45 minutes to get to that office which never exsisted. I then called customer service this morning to complain about the inconvience that this caused. I was then told that the ipower card application expired 12/8/2008. Today is 12/10/2008. It does not specified this on the flyer. I am very discussed at this point and will not be filing my taxes thru Jackson Hewitt. I've been a loyal customer for many years, but this type of misconseption is uncalled for. I'm very disappointed and feel if Jackson Hewitt can not get it together then they need to close their doors. What does this say about them be reliable in filing anyones taxes.
i am employee in Jackson Hewitt for 4 years. And yes i do think that they charge to much to get taxes prepare. My office is located in an urban area. Hello 400 dollars to be charge on a simple return i think that's to much. But one thing that i have to say is that many people don't even ask what type of deduction they are getting.The majority of the clients that had seated down with me just want MONEY BACK!!!! (and don't even care how much or what was deducted in the tax return.) I do really think that there should be more trained people working in the company.For example every tax prepare should educate their costumers about the RAL. In no world IRS is going to send your money in 24 hours. RAL IS A LOAN!!!!!!!!! But compared to what they pay us the company don't really care much if you have an education or not. This is why you see many tax prepare such ghetto attitude.Imagine what type of school educated person would accept 7:50 hourly? Instead they tell you is 7:50 an hour signing with bonus. JAJAJAJAJJAJAJAJAJA At the end of tax season where is the bonus?? They always tell you sorry but you overdraw economic damage is that this is a very super stressful job dealing with people of all kinds. Plus the salary sucks.Physical damage is that many costumer have there own problems with IRS, and then when they apply they owe money. Costumers want to turn off computers and knock everything down!This is a very big physical and emotional damage. Many people don't know that managers and some tax prepare work more than 10 hours the whole entire week to get stress out.And yes there is out there good tax prepare and managers out there. Any where you go their is professional and unprofessional working at a COMPANY.
I first used the tax service at Jackson Hewitt in 2005. I understood it to be a professional that was preparing my tax return. I returned to this office and to the same individual in 2006.I paid $850 to have my taxes prepared in 2006. In 2008 I received a letter from the IRS that I was being audited for tax year 2006. When I went to the audit, it was discovered that my taxes were completely incorrect. Their were deductions taken that must be depreciated over a period of time and instead the agent took them all in one year. He also took dedcution for running my home office. He also took a percentage of the total value of my home instead of either the depreciation or a percentage of the taxes and interest. This resulted in over $100,000 in deductions that were not allowed. This was due to him incompetence and not being familiar with the tax laws. It has also resulted in being audited for 2007 because of the items found in the 2006 return. In 2007 I returned to the same agent to prepare my taxes since I thought he was familiar with them and it was my third year with him. The Jackson Hewitt office that he worked out of had closed so he sent a letter to his clients stating that he has state of the art software and could prepare them in the comfort of his home. Well, that is what I did, and he charged me $800 to prepare my taxes at his kitchen table. They were handwritten with a pencil and no software was used. He once again took incorrect deductions, the same mistakes he make in the previous years. This time, it was even worse. When I contacted him to let him know I was being audited he stated I am sorry to hear that. In the 20 years I have been preparing taxes, no one has ever been audited, but I can't say that I am surprised! I asked him to review how he calculated the use of home for office and he stated I have no idea where those numbers came from, the computer must have been messed up that day!! He claimed that all you do is feed numbers into the computer and it spits out your return. I am more than furious about this. I am in the position that I owe the IRS tens of thousands of dollars in back taxes, interest and penalties.
I went down to apply for the holiday loan again this year since I never have the money to get my children anything, and once again i was denied. I've never understood why I can't get this loan but other people I know with horribly bad credit can. Considering this comes from your tax return, everyone who will recieve a refund should be approved, since it states that you have to put your refund on a card just so the bank can get their money back. I don't appreciate things being made out that I can get the help and then I try and i'm slapped in the face. I'm really getting tired of having to choose between seeing smiles on my childrens face or seeing the disappointment. Just once I would like someone to understand what it's like, and say hey, i would be more than happy to give you a lift up for the holidays. The consequences from being turned down for a simple holiday loan that comes from my tax return is that once again I have to explain to my children that santa couldn't stop here this year or that he's gonna make a special trip later. I don't think it's right that a 6 yr old and 3 yr old should have to experience that heart breaking dissappointment because mommy doesn't make enough money to buy them christmas presents or that she can't get help.
I'm a former employee of Jackson Hewitt Tax Service. I would like to express my feeling of working for this company. It is true that most of my co-workers did not seem to have proper knowledge about Federal Taxation. The one whom I worked with often made mistakes and errors while our manager didn't seem to care much. All the upper level managers were only concerned about the store's sales and revenue but not for the interest of taxpayers.
My taxes were file wrongand cost me a pay back. They are now taking money out of my social sercurity check. That I can't afford.
I had my 2006 tax return completed by Jacson Hewitt. They made an error on my NYS tax return. When I called about the error they were only willing to reibmurse me for the interest. I paid them $379.95 for the return and strongly feel they should also reimburse me for the state tax preparation, When I requested a reimbursent for the fee they flatly refused. Since I moved to Nevada, I am unable to sue them in small claims court. I now owe $172.55 in taxes. I retired in 2007 shortly and this fee has put a financial burden on me. I am very upset that due to their negligence I have this bill.
I had my 2007 Incone Taxes prepared by Jackson Hewitt at the Kew Gardens office NY 11418. I just received notice from NYS that due to an error Jackson Hewitt made I owe $172.55. I owe $153.00 in tax plus $19.55 in penalties. I have moved to North Las Vegas NV so Jackson Hewitt here was unable to assist me. When I called New York they would only offer to pay the interest. They are refusing to issue me a partial payment of my fees. I am now retired living on a fixed income and appalled that they won't even consider reducing their fees. I paid them $350.00 at the time and strongly feel that they should reimburse me the fee they as the error was made by them. The error was that they failed to add a 414H in the state return. The consequence is that my income is drastically reduced as I am now retired. This is causing me a financial burden,
I have called 6 times with no return I got a check from the settlement. I cashed it yet the account was closed. I want the $30 that was due to me on top of my $12 I got charged for a bad check. I will go to court to sue!
I recently inherited a sum of money from a cousin that passed away. Prudential failed to deduct the proper amount for Federal tax. Jackson- Hewitt listed deductions that were not true. Now i have to pay the $12.000.00 back I received for 2006 plus penalties and interest to the amount of $42.000.00. I am trying to get that reduced. Jackson Hewitt gave me a $5000.00 check and indicated that was the extent of their liability, they also offered $150.00 towards the penalty and interest hardly sufficient. I am retired so it is really upsetting that all I saved and inherited probably will be gone.
In 2006, my husband and I filed our taxes with Jackson Hewitt Tax Service. We paid them $375.00 to file our taxes through their service. The tax preparer which was the manager forgot to include a $500 dependent care expense as well as a $97 in dividends. When I called and spoke with a representative on September 30, 2008 after I received a notice from the IRS, she pulled the original paperwork and said that it had never been reviewed or signed by anyone else other than Mr. ** who prepared it... per Sharon ** at the Columbia, SC. Broad River location.
at the time that i went to take care of the taxes for my husband and my self i file injed spouse Mr P. looked over everything and didn't inform me that by doing so my part of the refund could take any where from 12 to16 weeks. as of yet i have goteen it. i was living in north lauderdale at the time. when i file he also told me the money would go in to my checkin acc on may 2 2008 when you claim like that where one spouse owes and another dose not they will not put the monies into your checkin. i found all this out from the irs and because of the way he file things that whats holding up my refund. I tried to call him 3 times leaving messages with my phone. i didn't move until july. he never retuned my call pluse he over charges for what is a short form. we claim nothing. we own no homes. i paid less from h and r block when i owned a house and had a long detailed form. you need to look into it. still waiting for my money. the man should be shut down
The year 2005 tax return was prepared by Jackson Hewitt preparer. After about 1 year and 4 months IRS wrote me, and said i owe $11,000 for 2005 return. I took all of the information that i received from IRS back to Jackson Hewitt (Fields Corner Dorchester office) The preparer who completed my 2005 return was not there but the manger Carla was there. I explained the situation to Carla and she said she would have to make some phone calls to figure out what heppened, after contacting her home office. Carla, saw where the first preparer made the mistake (due to a computer error a specific line was not completed on my 2005 tax papers. The line asked if about my loan from my 401k but the first preparer did not see that line but when Carla checked with her home office they guide her to where the line is. Carla completed my tax papers again and I sent it back to IRS and they re-wrote me back stating I owe 6000 dollars. I set up a payment plan with IRS and made arrangement to pay them back the money. The problem is Jackson Hewitt refuse to take any responsibility about my claim (that it was not my fault) the jackson hewitt preparer made a mistake and why should i be penalized for her mistake. I paid 300 dollars to have my taxes prepared by a professional so that means i have complete trust in her actions. I assumed she would prepare my taxe form 2005 correct. Jackson should shoulder most of this amount that i owe IRS, out of the 6000 dollars I should only owe 2800 which would have been the amount i owe if the jackson hewitt preparer did the forms correctly in the begining. Furthermore, since this clearly not my fault jackson hewitt should refund me my 300 plus 3200 dollars back to me. I have called numerous times to corporate office BUT NOTHING has happened. I have been dealing with this situation for over 2 and half years. I have run out of avenues to complain to. The result of jackson hewitt preparer not completing my tax forms correct i ended owing IRS 6000 dollars. which i have to pay
My 2003 taxes have been fradulent file with the irs. I'm in the process of finding out the details. Eric was the tax preparer according to the irs. He has made with 4,363 dollars of my money.
In 2005 I had my taxes filed with Jackson & Hewitt. I paid almost $300 to have my taxes filed by what I thought was a reputable place of business. However, I received a letter from the IRS stating that figures on my tax return were incorrect and that I owed $3500 to them. I called Jackson & Hewitt to inquire about this and got the around. I was told someone would call me back. No one called me back. I called back again and was hung up on. This has been going on for over a month and still no one has called me back to help resolve this issue. Jackson & Hewitt takes your business and guarantees you that if they make a mistake they are liable. However, they refuse to back those words up. I now owe the IRS over $500 in interest and penalties because of Jackson & Hewitts mistake.
Well I went to Jackson Hewitt for my returns back in 2006 for my 2005 taxes season. I went around the time it was pretty. I knew a girl that worked there because I previous worked with her at another job. I trusted Tracy with my tax returns. I actually dropped them off because I was in a rush because I had another appointment. She messed my taxes up so much she put on my returns that I had two kids (I have none) she also put on my returns that I have own my own business (I do not). Causing me to owe the IRS and not receiving a refund for that year. Now I just found out that I owed the IRS this year when I received my stimulus refund check and it was like 522.00 short of what the first letter stated. I was very upset. I called Jackson Hewitt to let them know what happened and they gave me the complete run around. I told me it is not their problem we have a new owner now and we can't do anything for you. I'm thing to myself this is your problem because of the fraudulent information my preparer put on my taxes caused my not to receive a refund and bad part owe the Irs. I contacted the Irs and the gave me some wonderful advice to handle Jackson Hewitt because they agreed that because of the information Tracy Carter put on my return that's why I owed that IRS and did not get a return. No one has yet helped my in this matter. The lady at the local office is extremely rude and very ignorant. Needless to say I will never use Jackson Hewitt Tax Service again! Due to her fraudulent information, I haven't received a refund in about 2 years and I didn't receive a refund in 2006 when I was suppose to
I received notice from IRS that my 2006 return was incorrect as I had not reported all of my income and had entered another item incorrectly. I was notified of what I owed them thousands of dollars, plus penalties and interest (which is still accruing). I have income from 2 sources - my job and fixed payments from a retirement account. The retirement account income (the bulk of my income) was what was not reported. I was astounded and immediately called and went to the Jackson Hewitt office to ask for help. The person who prepare my return was not in, but there were 2 individuals there, who apologized to me, told me that there was obviously an error made and told me that either the office manager or Mr. W. (owner of franchise) would contact me the next day. I was also given a business card with their names and contact information it it. No one called, so I attempted to contact Ms. J., office mgr., by e-mail. My e-mail was not returned, but she claims to have never received it nor a follow up one. When I again called and went back into the office, I met with Ms. J. who informed me that they were not at fault in any and that they would prepare an amended return for me to send to the IRS - which they did. I did not purchase their "Gold Guarantee" as I could not afford it. They are claiming that this is my fault, they never had the income statements in their possession, otherwise they would have a copy of it attached to their file copy. However, I was given a copy of their file copy and the 2nd page of the statement is included. Obviously, the preparer had the complete statement in hand at some point or he would not have been able to copy the 2nd page, which showed the interest income from same account. The IRS also notified me that a copy of my W-2 from my employer was not provided with the return either. They did have that in their file as well. I have been going round with the IRS on this since March now and it is still not resolved. It is my belief that, since Jackson Hewitt is to blame for not reporting the income on my return nor providing the IRS with a copy of my W-2 as is normal practice, that they should be responsible for at least a portion of the penalties and interest. I have written Jackson Hewitt's Corporate office, their local office, and the IRS' Office of Professioal Responsibility. The only response I have received was from the IRS who did tell me that they will review the information and give it all due consideration. I have gone on-line to see if others have had problems with this particular office of Jackson Hewitt and there were many complaints, including Mr. W.'s being brought to task for his questionable business practices. Sure wish I had checked this out before going there. Ideally, I would like to find some venue to pursue Jackson Hewitt's liabibility in this case. If nothing can be done, then I want everyone in Durham, NC to know that they should never do business with this particular office or any other business Mr. W. is involved in. I am a divorced, single mom. I am on a fixed income. My children have just finished college and I was already way over my head in debt from school expenses and living expenses for myself and them following my divorce. Having this IRS claim hanging over me has pushed me to the limit. I do not have the money to pay them back and I am maxed out on my credit limits. I am currently in the process of trying to sell several pieces of household furnishings and am readying my home to put on the market later this month in order to try to ease my debt and pay off the IRS. I don't know anything else to do and I don't know where else to turn for help in this matter.
I have done my tax return through Jackson-Hewett for several years, and never have I had this happen. I will never do business there again I have always had my return sent directly to my apartment. This year, for no reason whatsoever, without request or even being given the option, they had the return check sent to their office. I didn't even care about that, though - the office is only a couple blocks away The check arrived in their office in March/April. They called to let me know and to have me pick it up. At the time, I was busy working and attending school in the mornings. I didnt have time to come to the office until after April, when the tax season came to a close After that, their hours of operation reduced to a mere couple of hours per day, for only one day a week. That also was no big deal, albeit an inconvenience. I swung by their office during their business hours and no one was there. I assumed they were on break. I waited until the next week I was forced to ditch class three weeks in a row to make it to the office during their operating hours, their mere two hours per week - no one was ever there. I called them just to get an answering machine. The machine says their hours of operation, as does the display at their office But, every week it seems, their hours of operation change. One week its Monday, the next its Friday, the next its Thursday. I cant plan for it. After the first month I concluded they werent going to be there anyway After four months of calling them and leaving messages, trying to arrange a pickup or to have them mail my check to me, no one ever picked up the phone. After a dozen answering machine messages, no one has yet returned by phone call As it stands, I am unable to pick up my tax return check, and have been unable to do so since it arrived in their office three or four months ago. I am quite irritated. Ive probably wasted more money on phone bills and gas trying to get my check than I was getting as a return Someone is dropping the ball. The company is being unprofessional and irresponsible. All I want to do is pick up my check I called the JH main company to complain. They told me to call the branch office "tomorrow". I did, just to get a machine stating open hours "tomorrow". I went - they were closed I swung by the office in mid June 08 - during their business hours. There was a note on their door stating that they have man-power issues and that they are understaffed - understandable. The note asks people to call the Puyallup office I called the Puyallup office at around 12 noon, told them my situation. They insisted that it wasnt their fault and didnt want to take responsibility. The company, apparently, is a franchise. They said they would make a few phone calls and "call me right back". That was over two days ago. I have the feeling that they are dropping the ball, too (not that Puyallup should be held accountable) I have written JH in email, their main company headquarters, using the address they provide on their website (which was nearly impossible to find, mind you). I wrote them back late May. Still havent gotten a reply I want someone to admit guilt and to take responsibility. I want them to open their office doors and allow me to pick up my check. I paid them more this year than in years past - they keep raising their prices outrageously. I paid them for a service - not just to file, but to ensure that I received the check by appropriately filing a return address (at least allow pickups). Apparently having them do their job is too much to ask for All I want - and I mean ALL I want - is to get the check. I wasnt asking for anything big I wanted someone to pressure these people into relinquishing my check to me - I ended up being forced to file a formal complaint with the BBB because the BBB was the only ones that cared enough to return my calls Withholding money that I am due, property that is rightfully mine, is borderline criminal
I went to Jackson Hewitt in April 2008 to have my 2006 and 2007 taxes prepared. I asked how much it will cost me and she said she can't tell me until she's done but it won't be too much. She said the computer will tell her when she's done. I needed to get them filed on time, so I told her to go ahead and prepare them. It ended up costing me $598 for both years. I hate to think what she thinks is or isn't too much! Very deceitful by not giving me a clue how much I would be charged! When she prepared the 2nd year, it took her about 10 minutes because she had all my information in the computer. $300 for 10 minutes is RIDICULOUS! What makes it worse is the way she told me to pay for the tax preparations. She asked me for 2 blank checks and ran them through some machine. She said it works like a debit card and the money will come out right away. I checked for over a month and the money never came out. I thought GREAT, they overcharged me and it serves them right! I even called to find out what was going on because I'm not looking for a free ride even though they scammed me. They said they never heard of anyone asking for a blank check before and no one in customer service could help me. They told me to call the office where I had them prepared. It's off-season...no one's there! What am I supposed to do now? It's almost 3 months later and I checked my bank account today and they decided to finally take the money out. Luckily I had the funds to cover it. I completely forgot about it, but what would have happened if I didn't have the funds in my account to cover it...3 months later? I believe they purposely did not take the money out right away so they could then charge me another fee for insufficient funds (thinking I'd go ahead and spend that money). In short, Jackson Hewitt is a RIPOFF. I will be telling everyone NOT to go there! They charge way too much for the bit of work the computer does for them. Customer service did not attempt to help me nor did they seem to care about the stress I was going through wondering if I could spend any of that money to make ends meet in this horrible economy we're trying to deal with now. This could have been a nightmare for me if I had not had the funds to cover this outrageous overcharge of $600 that they decided not to take out until 3 months later after I gave them 2 blank checks (my fault--will NEVER do that again!). With the economy the way it is right now, it's been very stressful for me the last 3 months wondering if I could spend any of that money or not to make ends meet. No one at Jackson Hewitt Customer Service would help me nor did they seem to care.
I went into Jackson Hewitt to have my 2006 taxes done. I gave Flor all my information all my husbands information and let her do her magic. Well magic is exactly what she didn't do. You think you are going to a place like this and having your taxes done by a professional well atleast that is what I thought. Until may of 2008 when I recieved a letter stating that I owe the IRS $1600 because of jackson hewitts mistake. I went into Jackson Hewitt and come to find out on my husbands w-2 form it stated $11,000 well Flor put $1100. So now I have to come up with $1600 tht I should have never recieved because of Jackson Hewitt's error. I called the office and took them my paperwork they told me that all they are going to pay is $140 for the initial interest and penalties. So now I get to make a monthly payment to IRS that I don't have and also continue to get interest and penalties put against it so I can owe them even more money. I now have to take extra money away from my family because of Jackson Hewitts mistake. I am one person that will never go to Jackson Hewitt again and I will tell all my family and friends not to go there.
I went to Jackson Hewitt to fill my taxes on Feb.17th of 2008 and Lisa was name of the lady who filled my taxes and everything went fine until I got a letter from the state of Wisconsin saying I was being aduited.I called Jackson Hewitt right away and I talk to lisa she assured me that it was fine so I called the state to find out what happened and come to find out that Lisa had filed me for earned income credit when I was no eliglbe for it because I moved out of the state before the end of the year. When I went down to the Jackson Hewitt store to tell them about it they told me there was nothing they could do,so I called the main number and they blew me off and I sent emails and never no responds. I would never go back there and I would never send nobody there they are a joke. You pay so much to fill your taxes there and get screwed out of money and they will never refund your money no matter what. I had to wait five months for a refund that I should have received in two weeks.I was suppose to get $1100.00 back and I am only getting 400.00 just because the lady that filled my taxes didn't know what she was doing
I filed my taxes and requested direct deposit. After 3 weeks I called because I had yet to receive my refund. I called again after 4 weeks and they said wait one more week. After 5 weeks they said oh we did your return by paper and not electronically so call the IRS in another week. So at 6 weeks I find out from the IRS that Jackson Hewitt, whom I paid lots of money to, did not file my taxes! Oh the best part is that when I called them and made them aware of their mistake I received a oh oops, do you still want us to file them for you? And then in the end found out they would not mail them out or send them electronically nor would they refund me considering they at least prepared my taxes! No more Jackson Hewitt for me!
We filed our 2006 taxes through Jackson Hewitt in march of 2007. All documents were presented to the tax preparer including my 1099 for social security. The tax preparer Sonia, who worked there failed to input into the computer the correct socail security earnings for 2006 onto the federal 1040 form for the taxes to be filed. We werent aware of this as we dont go over the taxes once we pay a preparer to so. This was our very first year using Jackson Hweitt and they did this to us. WE received a lettter from the IRS this year in 2008 letting us know that thre was a discrepancy in our taxes for that year. 2006. WE called the irs to get a 30 day extension until we could get to the jackson hewitt office to talk with them about it. When we went to the jackson hewitt office the manager terri there did a amended return free on the federal and the state. We were told that they would only pay the interest fees up to that date on the irs debt. Since we have been to Irs and had to file a paper waving the penalty fees and we were told by irs that the amendments didnt even need to be filed, they were sent in and drawn up for nothing. Now jackson hewitt says that they are not paying for anything other then the interest up to date, and so far irs hasnt seen any of that money yet either. WE now have a 805.00 debt to the irs because of their error. Sonia no longer works there, the lady who made such a error. WE can not afford to pay the irs back the money owed that we should of never gotten to begin with but we did because our taxes were done wrong, Jackson hewitt should be responsible in paying the debt. WE have never, ever had a irs debt ever until now. We still get a stimulus payment but that was suppose to be used to take care of whatever was needed just like any other american getting theirs. Now we wont get a stimulus payment or in fact, we hope its enough to cover the debt.
In February of 2007 my husband and I went to Jackson Heweitt to get our taxes filed as this was the first year we were filing together since we had just gotten married a few months before. We took in our W-2's and a print out of his earnings from a job at the airport. The lady doing our taxes filled everything out as normal but when she got to the peice that had his earnings she said that she could not file that and that there was no need to file it because it didn't have the EIN number and because it wasn't but a $3000 worth of earnings. Needless to say, we did need to file it. We thought that she knew what she was talking about so we didn't think nothing else of it. 2 weeks ago (May of 08) we get a letter from the IRS stating that we owe $550 plus penelties and other fees for not claming the $3000 from the airport. I immediatly notified Jackson Hewitt and they told me to bring the paper work in to them right then because I had the Gold Guarentee that I paid $50 for (not counting $300 to file our taxes that year). I asked her why it had taken so long and she said that the reason we didn't get notified sooner is because not only did the lady not file that portion, but she had put my husband name on the return wrong. She had put his first name with my Maiden name. Not sure why since all his W2's and SSN card and DL card had his last name. She said that they government purposely waited till this year when we filed out taxes so that they could get the accurate info off of his SSN and make sure that no one else was using his SSN. Now its been 2 weeks and still, they haven't called me back and when I call they put me on hold...I am assuming to call the supervisor that was supposed to have called me back 2 weeks ago....well it's always, I need to take a message cause she is busy right now. I have 8 days left to get that paid. And not only do I not have the money to pay this, I am still waiting on my stimulus check that was held up do to us oweing taxes and not knowing
I filed my 2007 taxes at Jackson Hewitt this season, and it was the worst decision I've made concerning taxes. I was in and out of work this year and I have three children, I pay my own bills and live by myself. However the lady that filed my taxes filed me as single when I told her that I was head of household and I have three children she did not file my third child. When I got home and looked over my papers I noticed the mistakes and contacted the regional offices and they said by me signing the papers there was nothing they could do, so I basically waiting for an audit because of this mistake, but I should of reviewed the forms before signing I was just moving to fast. The workers at the location I went to really needed to take a course in customer service because they were all rude not just one the whole office with music blasting having customers stand and wait until they decided to look up and service them it was a disaster. I will warn anyone that thinks about using Jackson Hewitt go to H&R Block if you can't do your own
well in january 11 2008 my husband and i went there to prepare our taxes and the girl was so slow of doing them she act like she did not know what to do. she ask us to many questions and it cost us 347.00. she ask us did we want to pay up front. i said no, do it look like we have money to spare. i just barely had enough gas to get up there. but the consequences it was to high of a price to get it in 2 weeks of our deposit and now the rebate is going out in july instead of our bank account. my bills is past do. it is stupid about everything
My husband and I had Jackson Hewitt do our taxes in February '07 and received a rapid refund. It wasn't two months later that we found out that they had excluded my income altogether in order to get us a refund which is illegal. We had to pay our entire refund in for 2007 for their mistake. Fortunately, I looked over the paperwork and realized that we only owed the IRS a 1/3 of what was paid back in our '07 taxes. The IRS saw the same mistake and realized that we did not even make enough money in 2006 to owe that much in taxes. Thankfully we will be recieving a refund of the difference in the next few months but everyone else is not as fortunate for these so-called professionals screw ups. From then on, I have prepared my taxes myself for free online and with no mistakes because they are approved sites by the IRS.
This company did my 2006 taxes. The gentleman that completed mine was so incompetent that me made over $1000 in errors; that is how much I owed IRS and had to pay back by March 2008. I am requesting that Jackson Hewitt pay me back the entire amount of the error. This was not some small error, which I could except. The employee made several big errors. The company charged me over five hundred dollars for their services. They are stealing...and this goes beyond human error. I have made several attempts to get them to repay me and they have not so much as responded to my requested. These people are thieves. I am a single parent and $1500 (in errors and charge for their services) is a lot of money to me. Being out $1500 in funds that I count on has been economically disastrous for me. This is a big company and I am a peon. I am out this much money. This business is dishonest and I intend on telling everyone I know about it.
My check was sent to the local office in March 2008. I called the Maryland Comptoller in May 2008 to find out where my return was. I was told that the check was sent directly to my preparer, however, I was never notified. I called Jackson Hewitt's 1-800 number and was told that my return was deposited into a different bank account and I would have to wait until the regional manager got back to me to find out why....I'm still waiting.
my sister came from ala. to live with me. 2004-2005 she filied her taxes with jackson hewitt. we both asked if she could file my children since i didn't work and without asking any other questions she told us yes, as long as she lived in the home and contributed to the household. well my sister was audited and has to pay back all that money. when we called jackson hewitt to ask for help they told us that there was nothing we could do expect pay back the money regardless of the preparer telling us that it was ok to file them. they are awful. will never use any of their services again. this company will say any thing just to make a dime including lying to customers. we have to repay all that money back with a payment plan that we can't afford but have to keep because of the interest that is growing

I was told my income tax refund would arrive within 8-15 days, and currently it's been over 21 days and I still have no sign of a return. But what aggravated me is that when I called about it I was told it would take several weeks, and that it's my fault for not understanding. Upon escalating to a region manager he told me to stop picking a fight. I feel I was mistreated. I still havent recieved my tax return. The representatives rudeness cetainly caused a rise in my blood pressure.
My taxes were prepared by a local Jackson Hewitt office at which time a mistake was made even though I tried to explain the mistake at that time. An ammendment was done the next day, Jan.21 2008. I was told at that time it would be mailed that day to IRS. Unfortunately, it went missing for two months and was not post marked until March 5,2008. I have filed many complaints and talked to several supervisors and have not yet received an answer as to what might have happened. The IRS reports that my taxes could take at least 8-12 weeks more. As a result of late filing, I have several obigations that have went into delinquency including poperty taxes, mortgage payments , insurance.
My wife and I filed our 2007 taxes with Jackson Hewitt in Feb. 2008. We told them on the phone we had to file for CT and PA; they told us it would cost $150.00. Well...it turned out that the person doing our taxes didn't know how or where to: 1) claim the $600.00 I spent for exams 2) file my Pa Berkheimer taxes (so she didn't) 3)where to send my PA state taxes; and lost my W-2 for unemployment so I can't file the Berkheimer myself. Come to find out, she even charged us $350.00 to do our taxes--not the $150.00 we were quoted...and messed them up to boot. Now I will have to pay someone to redo my PA local tax after I try to get another W-2.
I filed my taxes in Feb. '08 to later get a letter from the State of Indiana saying that my taxes were missing forms. I went back into the office where the manager Sylvia Jones assured me that she amended my taxes and that I shouldn't worry. I didn't hear from the IRS, so I called; and they told me that my taxes were suspended and that they are still missing forms. I went back to Jackson Hewitt where I was verbally abused--literally cursed out! She later told me to get out of her business and was totally ignorant. People like that should not be able to represent Jackson Hewitt. I had my 16-year-old son with me when Sylvia Jones cursed me.
I had my taxes done in Feb. 2008, and I filed for the rapid refund. The federal refund came back in two days, but when I went to pick up the check they told me that I had to mail the state refund. I paid a fee of $425.00 for them to file my taxes, and I still have to wait for my refund for state. What can I do about this? It caused me economic damage because I was expecting to get my state as well as federal back in a timely manner. Now I don't know when I will get any more money.
Recently I received a letter from the IRS regarding my 2005 tax return. According to the letter, my 2005 tax return was done and had given me over $100,000.00 deductions in medical. That could have possibly been done. After talking with JH, they only would refund my penalties and interest. I still have to pay back over 3,000 to the IRS. JH indicated that I should have signed up for the GOLDEN GUARANTEE. I have never heard of a Golden Guarantee, nor did any one tell me about it until this year. I am very upset about it especially now that I found out that I have MS and have huge doctor bills to pay. I am a single parent with a 16-year-old getting ready for college. This is not a good time. Employees of JH should be held accountable for their mistakes regardless of any guarantee. As of the beginning of the tax season, this person is still working for JH in another office. I recently received my check for the interest on the $3,800. That is only a drop in the bucket. I have stress that I don't need. Plans for this years tax return has gone to pay doctor bills. Other bills are not getting paid on time--not to mention trying to keep up main household bills. I have not heard from the IRS yet to find out if they are going to allow me to make payment. Then there is a fee for that, also. If I have to pay the entire $3,000, I don't know where the money will come from. I do not have money for an attorney either.
My husband went into Hewitt Jackson the night before we filed our 2007 taxes and asked an approximate cost of doing taxes. He was told around $150.00. The next day he went down to have the taxes filed. When the person was done entering the information and filing our taxes, the cost of doing our taxes came to $531.95. I almost fell out of the chair. We then found out later, after looking at the paperwork, that there was a fee to a bank who sent our refund check. We were not informed that there would be a bank fee. Then when I went to pick up the check, I asked the manager why the fee for filing our taxes was so much, and she said that they had nothing to do with figuring the cost, the cost was figured by the computer. I have never heard of it costing that much to file a tax return even with moving and a few different W2s. They said it depended on the number of forms that had to be filled out. We don't even have a business. The only reason we had a tax office do our taxes is because we had some errors on our 2005 tax return. We could have done just as well ourselves by the time we got done paying that much money to have our taxes filed. This is highway robbery, and Hewitt Jackson is taking advantage of people--especially by not giving a reasonable estimate before filing someone's taxes. Tax preparing offices should be able to give you the fee before filing with them. Cost a third of our tax refund to file with Jackson Hewitt when we could have done the same thing buying the software for no more than $50.00. This is crazy.
My wife and I recently went to Jackson Hewitt to have our taxes done. We were not informed ahead of time that the cost to have the service would be almost $400. Shortly after our taxes had been filed we received a letter from the state of Missouri telling us that our taxes had been filed incorrectly and that an adjustment will have to be made in the amount of nearly $120 less than what was quoted to us by the JH tax professional. I became alarmed and wanted to find out what these discrepancies were, and to get a refund on my tax preparation fees. Getting someone on the phone in this company is quite a challenge. I called the branch only to find out I was supposed to call the franchise office. Well, the franchise office doesn't answer the phone, nor does it return phone calls. The corporate office will only return you to the local branch, and none of these entities knows what the other is doing. There is definitely a breakdown in communication. Finally, someone did call and admitted that a mistake had been made on the filing of my taxes, but was quick to tell me that no refund is warranted nor will it be granted. I guess it's okay to overcharge and under-deliver for your services. All I have asked is for Jackson Hewitt to admit that a mistake was made and correct it.
I have used this tax service for many years. I was really upset this year when it took a total of 15 minutes for the filing the agent who had all my recent information to hit a couple of buttons and give me a couple of choices as to how I would like my refund. I am aware that the cost is high for RAL, but to have to wait 8-15 days for your money and still be charged $245.00 in cash up front is just down-right robbery. Needless to say, my taxes were done on Feb.4, 2008; it is now Feb. 21, 2008, and no money. When the agent tells you 8-15 days, you plan on getting your money within that time. I wish I would have read some of the complaints I see now on the web site. I will not use Jackson Hewitt services again and make sure I tell everybody about the robbery. I was a loyal customer for years--now it's their loss!
I received a deficiency notice from state return for 2004. I returned it to tax preparers at Jackson Hewitt. The people that I dealt with were very unprofessional and because they were not going to make any money off of me, because they work on productivity, they made rude comments to me on the phone and hung up on me instead of resolving issues. I will never use their services again. `

I went to jackson hewitt last year and tried to file but this employee name tiffany benson, told me that I made to much so I didn't qualify. So I said okay, then I went back in 2008 and tried to file the and IRS told me that my return was already filed in 2007 and went into somebody's bank account already from the jackson hewitt store. I told them it was wrong because the girl told me I made to much but instead the company at 3261 frayser last year did fraud in my name and stole my identity last year. Now I don't know how I will be able to ever file. I have three witnesses to my case.
My husband went into our local Jackson Hewitt office to get a quote on filing our Married Filing Joint Income Tax Return. To make a long story short: They went ahead and e-filed it WITHOUT my consent or signature. My husband told me to stop in the office to sign after I was done work. When I arrived and noticed the fee of $350.00, for filing a basic 1040, I told them I do not agree with the fees and do not want them them to file and would go else where. They told me it was too late. The young lady in the office became very aggressive, so feeling intimidated I asked for names and left. I tried escalating with HJ customer service via telephone. They provided the worst customer service. In the end they offered $100.00 off this year's return and a coupon towards next year's filing--AS IF I WOULD EVER USE THEIR SERVICES AGAIN! I told them this was unacceptable. I have filed a complaint with the BBB and contacted the IRS. I explained to JH I am not trying to get something for nothing. I agree we should have to pay since they did actually file the return. Time is money after all. I thought 50/20 would be fair. They refused. I refuse to sign the return.
We have used Jackson Hewitt for the last couple of years. Last year we paid $191 to have our taxes prepared. They told us their fees had changed but we paid $337 this year. They told us they couldn't tell us how much it would be since they didn't know what form they would use. What a crock. If we have gone there for a while then they would know which ones we use. I had to do my own city taxes since they weren't doing those this year. Also in the past they never asked us about home improvements to claim and didn't tell us that we could claim what we paid for tax preparation. I will never go back to them especially if I can do them online for free. If those idiots can do it then I think I can figure out my own taxes. Instead of getting almost 4000 back I have to pay out 337 in fees that were nto told to me up front.
I recently went in to have my tax return prepared by Jackson Hewitt. I elected to have the RAL refund for financial reasons. My refund was about $5,000 which I needed the next day as I originally requested. I was in turn denied the loan from Santa Barbara Bank. I was told that I would have to wait 8 to 15 days in order for the bank to receive my refund from the IRS. I asked Jackson Hewitt why and was told that it probably had something to do with my credit. What they should have said is that it probably has had something to do with the way they prepared my taxes or even that there might be a problem with the IRS's credit. When did my credit score start affecting my tax returns? I can only wonder how much effect the court case that toke place in California against SBB&T had to do with this delay? Why should my family be penalized for The Bank getting in trouble for preying on the poor? Late on rent, missed car payment, not able to get groceries for family.
I have read with shame, and disgust, the situations that have been displayed. Unfortunately, I can see that these are very common situations. However, In MY OFFICES, The following are clearly explained and always spelled out: The RAL is NEVER A GUARANTEE. IT IS A BANK DECISION TO LOAN MONEY ON THE REFUND, AND J.H. HAS NO INFLUENCE ON APPROVAL OR DENIAL. Gold Guarantee has a $5000 max limit. If you are approved for a max claim, $5000 + penalties and interests is the amount you will get. The remaining liability is yours, unfortunately. I have been working as an Office Manager for JH for the past five years. I have always gone to great lengths to make certain that a client FULLY UNDERSTANDS the ramifications of his/her products and service options choices, and is is truly regrettable that these situations occurred. I am saddened that the reports shown on this site have this much hostility and anger because of a few poorly trained and clearly misinformed office personnel....
My husband and I went in to Jackson Hewitt on 2-1-08 and filed our taxes. We were told we could not get a RAL despite the fact we had used the same company and bank the last 2-3 years in Texas. We were told on 2-8-08 that the bank had our refund and was cutting us a check. We called 2-9-08 and were told by a rude lady at the bank: "No, we do not have your money." We called a manager who said they only had a letter from the IRS saying when they would get the money, yet we are paying them $391 in fees including $30.95 to open an account--yet no one knows where our money is! My husband has been out of work for a month. We have three children, ages 6 and under. All of our utilities are getting shut off including gas which is our source of heat and cooking. I will never use Jackson Hewitt again and would definitely not recommend them to anyone.
I went to Jackson Hewitt to have my taxes done. At the time I told the lady filing it that I felt it was not correct. My refund was $500 approx., and they took over 1/2 of it in fees. I am eligible for EIC, so I asked again that it be reviewed. She told me I did my withholdings wrong for the year, and that it was my fault. When I returned to the office to speak with the manager, she found SEVERAL mistakes. They had the wrong marital status, date of birth and address. I asked that I get some sort of compensation. After redoing everything, my refund is almost $2000! BIG DIFFERENCE! I asked to have that money released to me since they were at fault and was told that since I had to file an amendment (due to their lack of training), that it would be at least the middle of summer before I would know anything. The only thing they offered is 1/2 off next year's tax fees! What a ripoff! Do they really think I will ever use them again? Not a chance! Now I know to do it myself; the amount I had originally figured was the same that they finally came up with. The only reason I went to them is to get my money back in a hurry! The work I do is seasonal, and I need the money for bills and my child!
Jackson Hewitt is the the most unprofessional company I have ever dealt with. They need to screen their employees better. I filed my taxes last year with them in Queens, NY. I have NEVER had a problem or owed money to IRS, and I have always received the expected amount when I file my taxes. Well, last year I was told I was going to receive $1500--and instead received a check for $50! I didn't bother researching what went wrong until recently when I started hearing all this negative stuff about JH. To make matters worse, the tax preparer kept harassing me and calling my house asking for a tip! Can you believe the nerve?
I went to Hewitt on 02/01/2008 to file my taxes using the rapid refund next day. I was told by the preparer that I would receive my check the next day. I asked her about what time I should expect for them to call me and she said around 9:00 a.m. They charged me $271.00 for Jackson Hewitt and $95.00 for the bank. I got a call Saturday morning on 02/02/2008 telling me that the bank denied my RAL and if I have any questions I need to contact IRS. I did and my expected date to receive my check is 02/19/2008. I don't think I should be charged that much money if I did not get the RAL. I do think they overcharge and something should be done about it. I was expecting to get the money so that I could pay my bills that are delinquent because I did not get my check the next day. Thank you Jackson Hewitt for nothing.
The people in this office told me I would get a check the next day. I called to today, to pick it up and was told I had to wait up to 7 days. The ladies in this office are VERY unprofessionally. They should not use the phone for personal use, eating at the desk, talking about peoples returns in front of everyone. And telling lies about your refund.They did not ask all the question like are you in the service, gas, home, any thing you need to claim. And I don't think I got the right refund amount because they were in a rush (they were not busy). If I knew this office was like this I would have gone somewhere else. I need to pay my bills and my little girl needs a cap on her tooth and glasses.
I went to my local Jackson Hewitt office to file my taxes and to use the RAL which I was sure that I would get since I was getting $7000.00 back from the IRS. They never once explained to me that it was a loan, and they never once advised me before beginning that I might be denied the loan; so I went ahead and had them do my taxes which cost over $400.00. Then I was told that I was denied for the RAL, and I was very upset because I was counting on this money which I needed now. That is why I did the RAL. They should explain to people that you might not get the RAL before they start, because if they had I would have gone home and filed the taxes on my computer myself for free. Now I have to wait 7-15 days for my money, and I am out $400.00. This is a lousy scam.
WOW, I wished I had known about this complaint site last year. All I have read here are horrible, and I think Jackson Hewitt company should be shut down! Is there a way we people can do that? I will be first in line. Any way, my experience was last year in 2007. I kept getting those $20-off pamplets in the mail, So I thought I would go use it, not having any idea what a tax preparer cost. I always did my own taxes. I had an appointment, only the lady didn't have me on the books. I had my paper work with me, and asked how much is this going to cost me before she started, since I consider myself poverty stricken. She looked at my paper work quickly--like she knew without really even looking. She asked ME, how much was my gross amount last year? I said it says it's right there, YOU JUST LOOKED AT IT LADY! Right there I knew I was in trouble. I said under $27,000 a year. She told me that it would cost me $120. I ABOUT FELL OFF MY CHAIR! I file a short 1040A form because I have nobody I support, just me with no assets! No deductions or stuff like that. Anyways, I walked away. So, I went home to my first ever computer and found out I could file on line with efile, through Turbo Tax, FREE. So I am saying it on here and again, somebody needs to get those Jackson Hewitt run out of business! THEY ARE PREYING ON PEOPLE BEING NOT ABLE TO DO THEIR OWN TAXES! Where can I file a complaint to get them run out of business? Is this the only place? Thanks for reading this.
I got my taxes done at the Delaware Rd. location in Buffalo, NY. It seemed like it was going to be okay. However, after filing my taxes, as I was signing the paperwork I noticed that the girl entered my social security number wrong. I then had to sit there for an additional 45 mins. while my 7-month-old was screaming because no one new how to fix it, and they had to call the store manager. So finally everything was fixed, and I paid $500 to have my taxes done and get $1000 the next day. Well, the next day comes, and Charlie (the store manager) calls me and leaves me a voicemail saying that I was denied to get the $1000 and that was it. I called him and was quite upset. (The woman who did my taxes told me that I was guaranteed that money). In the middle of me voicing my opinion and telling him about the ssn situation and everything, he hung up on me. THE STORE MANAGER HUNG UP ON ME! I was so upset I made my boyfriend go there and talk to him. I only got charged $100 for my taxes being done. But the experience was horrible, and I will never go there again. And I would recommend (unless you like aggravation and stress) that no one else goes there either.
My girlfriend and I decided to try going to a different place this year for our taxes to be done and get the money now--that we saw on the sign that we could. Well, let's say that it cost a lot more money to file with them, and we didn't get any money at all from them; we have been denied, and the reason: we just do not qualify. So now we have just entered into the same waiting game that we would have had to play if we just filed them ourselves on the net for about $50, but instead we paid Jackson Hewitt $363 for them to say we will need to wait--and then we can come back to their office to pick up our check when the gov sends it to them...not us. They didn't offer us auto deposit to our account either. When we asked about auto deposit (after being denied two times for the money now), they replied that our taxes were already filed, and it was too late. Another thing is we cannot get the office where we filed, on the phone; but they call us at any time they want. They called at 9:30 pm one night. Our story is just like others I've read on this sight, so don't go there for tax prep.
We went to have our taxes prepared this year. We filed every thing as usual and expected our money on the spot. We got $961 dollars then and were supposed to get over $3000 the next day. Well, we knew that out of our tax money we had a certain amount that we could spend, and the rest had to go to bills. So we went to Walmart and celebrated our new marriage by getting a hotel room and just spending the night by ourselves while my mother watched our little girl. The next day we went to pick up our check and guess what? No check. Jackson Hewitt messed up again. Because I filed a 1099 self employment paper, it disqualifies you from receiving the loans to get your money the next day. Our tax preparer should have known that. Because of her ignorance we have to wait until mid Feb. to get the rest of our money. Then when I got home I got to researching and the bank that Jackson Hewitt uses plainly states that if you file a 1099, you do not qualify for the loan. That lady gets paid to know these things, not me. Plus I had already had an estimate on our taxes and I was $2 off. So I entered last year's data into the program I use. I came up with a $590 difference. My calculations show that our refund should have been bigger. Did Jackson Hewitt rip us off? I have no rent money. My phone is going to be shut off. I have no money for gas to get my little girl to school. And the sad thing is Jackson Hewitt charged me $201 dollars to cheat us. I could have done our own taxes and got the money back in the same amount of time.
I have a complaint regarding one of their employees and how my questions on tax preparation were resolved at one of their offices. I arrived at the Bluffton, SC office, at Belfair Village, Wednesday, Jan 30, at approximately 7.00PM. Ms. Kisha Richards invited me at her desk and I showed her all the documents and I explained my situation. I have to say that I posses some knowledge of tax preparation but I had a question regarding where to enter a Tax Treaty Exemption (I found thereafter that was the line 21, other income, on 1040). I explained this problem and Ms. Richards replied to me immediately that the consultation cost me $20. I said, no problem. Then she left the room for minutes (but not for documentation), then returned and talked with other colleagues and by phone, visited other desks, as if I wasn't there. Finally she entered my wife and my data (we filled jointly) into a computer and said to me that we have to pay $1,700 if we file jointly, or $675 if we file separately (but adding immediately, that we did not have the right to both claim itemized deductions). I wondered if this could be true, because I knew from my wife's colleagues in exactly her situation (taxation of teaching income, 7 months exempted) that they received money, and were not were obliged to send them back. I asked Mr. Richards again if she took into consideration the 8833 Form, which I already completed, based on my wife's employer tips. She reminded me again that any consultation costs $20 - I said that I understood that - and she convinced me that that form is, anyway, of no use in tax calculation. I paid the $20, I left the office and I headed to another office (of a different company). They explained me there that that 8833 Form and the Tax Treaty Exemption (taxation of teaching income) is of great relevance in tax calculations. They solicited me for no money and calculated that we (my wife and I jointly) have due a refund of $2,600! I have definitively decided not to visit again this office for tax preparation and I am going to inform my friends and colleagues not to use their services anymore. Also I intend to post this complaint on the forums of tax preparation.
They did my 2006 tax returns. I was contacted by the IRS and they let me know that the preparer from jackson Hewitt had made a mistake on my return. Iwas also contacted by the FBI. When we got to the bottom of the problem, which was that my Federal Withholding taxes had been inflated. I then had to file a 1040X and when all was said and done, instead of getting a refund, i now owe the IRS. I went to the office wherer I had my taxes done, and was told that because I did not have a gold number they would not pay what I now owe the IRS, even though it was a preparer error. I now owe the the IRS, it has caused my blood pressure to stay elevated, I am on disability because I was hurt on my job, and I am worried that the IRS will take my disability until the debt is paid. If they do, how willI pay my bills?
I filed my taxes this year for the first time with JH. First of all the preparer seemed like she was in a hurry. Luckily, I was in view of her computer screen and realized that she spelled both of my kids' names wrong. I wanted to apply for the money now loan. I didn't qualify. So she told me that I would be approved for the RAL and receive my refund within 24-48 hours. Well, big surprise, I didn't get it. She says that the bank did not approve me (after telling me that I was approved). So I ask for the number to the bank to find out why I didn't get approved. The only thing that they could tell me was that I didn't meet certain criteria. When I asked them what the certain criteria was, they couldn't tell me. They said that I would have to wait 30 days for my denial letter. OK, if their sending me a denial letter stating why I wasn't approved, then why can't they tell me over the phone. Sounds like a scam to me.
I went in for the second year to get my taxes done. I always get my taxes back early and I used their next day service. But this time they put my wrong address, town and zip, so the bank denied me for unverifiable personal information and now since they also filed my state taxes, they are messed up also and they are trying to put it off as a student loan problem. In fact, I went to sbbt website and it says in plain bold print, "unverifiable personal information." It has caused me great financial hardship because I depend on that money for bills and had put them off until I get my money and made promised that I now cannot keep because of their stupid mistake. I cannot do anything about it at this point. They also told me on the phone to come get my check and when I got there, after driving 30 some odd miles, all they had for me is a letter stating I will have to wait almost 2 more weeks for my check. I would like to know what I can do about this since they are charging me $225 for a service they did not render very well. Do I have a case for at least getting that money back and to report these people so they will take notice of their stupid mistakes?
I received a letter from the IRS on December 3, 2007 requesting documentation to support my 2005 tax return (Gifts to Charity and Job Expenses). I contacted the Jackson-Hewitt office that prepared my taxes and found that they were closed until the official start of tax season. I was re-directed to another local office who gathered my IRS information. While there, I explained that the information the IRS is requesting is not available, given that I never provided my tax preparer with receipts to support gifts and job expenses. I explained that the tax preparer apparently took it upon himself to fraudulently fill in the blanks with information he concocted on his own. She then informed me that they would review my case and contact me within a week. Two weeks passed, and still no call. I decided to check the status of my review myself. I contacted the office and spoke to the same woman who told me she would follow-up with me within a week. When I told her my name and de-briefed her on my situation, she reacted as if we never spoke! After her selective amnesia wore off, she went on to say that they are still reviewing my paperwork. She advised me that that more than likely, Jackson-Hewitt wasn't going to do anything except cover my penalties and interest since I didn't purchase their Gold Package. I advised her that I was never told about their Gold Package because it was never offered to me. After going back and forth with her, I kindly reminded the tax employee that the IRS needed their documentation by January 3, 2008. She explained that a letter would be mailed to me regarding their in-office review. I questioned why I would be receiving the information when it is the IRS that is requesting it? She told me that I needed to call the IRS on my own and tell them that my original tax preparer filed a fraudulent tax return. By now, I'm very confused because if memory serves me correctly, they are dedicated to providing me the utmost in service, value and accuracy.. Another week passed, and still no letter. I called the office on Saturday, January 5, 2008 AGAIN to check the status. I continued my conversation with the same woman. However, this time I was informed that Jackson-Hewitt spoke to my original tax preparer and his manager and determined that he was not at fault. Since I signed on the dotted line I was in agreement with my tax preparers doing's. Oh, and I had also, somehow, provided him with the receipts to sustain my return?! I couldn't believe what I was hearing! At that point, I had had it. I couldn't continue listening to her rattle on about how they were going to weasle their way out of this. I asked for a letter stating just what she explained to me. She told me that she couldn't provide me with a letter. That was only provided to customers that purchased the Gold Package. I then asked for her immediate manager and regional manager's contact information. She provided names, but reluctantly gave me their numbers. She only provided her direct manager's number. I attempted to contact her manager first. When connected, I immediately asked office manager for the regional manager's telephone number. She told me that he wasn't available but that I could leave my name and number and she'll make sure he returns my call. I refused to leave a message. I asked for his office hours and just like that, she hung-up on me! The office manager! I called back immediately and the line continued to ring busy. I kept calling until she answered. She finally answered and pretended as if it was my phone that disconnected us. Again, I requested the regional manager's number. She refused to provide me with his information. I had to end our conversation. I couldn't take anymore. I am truly disgusted with the way Jackson-Hewitt does business. At this time, I don't know what penalties are going to be placed on me financially. I've never been audited before and I don't know what to expect. I really want justice to be served.
I filed my taxes with Jackson Hewitts' Waterloo, NY office in January 2006. A simple single W-2. As my taxes were done professionally, I felt no need to double check their work. (I trusted them). I got my refund fine and great, and did not think anything more about it. On Cristmas eve a got a letter from the IRS stating that my Income reported on my return was over $4000 less than on my W-2. Jackson Hewitt found and admitts to the preparers error, but now I owe the IRS over $1600.00 and New York State $700.00. All they offer is to ammend my return and pay the interest and penalties, because I did not purchase the gold garauntee. Why should I pay extra money to make sure they did thier job right? It's a matter of principle. They are supposed to be professionals. I paid money to make sure these kind of things don't happen. Now I'm stuck with a debt of around $2400 which I don't have. Had Jackson Hewitt done my taxes correctly, the IRS and New York State would have been satisfied. I have to pay around $2500.00 tax debt. I might face possible exclusion from claiming EIC for 10 years. This might potentially mess up my 2007 tax refund. This ruins my financial planning for this year.
I filed my taxes 7 yrs ago with Jackson Hewitt and was told I wasn't getting anything back because I didn't make enough that year, and lucky me, I received a letter from the IRS stating I never filed for 2000. Now I'm in debt for over $5,000.00.
I had Jackson Hewitt Tax service in Kernersville, NC file my 2004 taxes. I paid the fee and thought everything was taken care of. However, this year I have received notices from IRS and North Carolina Dept. of Revenue that I owe 2004 taxes, penalties, fees, and interest, and now my paycheck is being garnished. I called Jackson Hewitt and the gentleman stated, "Oh, the tax preparer did not key in a W-2, it's here in the file, it's clearly OUR FAULT, but you didn't purchase the gold guarantee; if you would have purchased that, we could pay you no questions asked, but we'll have to see what we can do." I have faxed them all the forms they have requested, and was told 12/6/07 they would know by 12/7/07, the settlement and when to expect it. I called today 12/7/07 and Mr. Tinnen was unavailable. I've been hassling with these people since the end of October 2007. Jackson Hewitt owes me $670 in penalties, interest and fees as a result of their negligence.They are dragging their feet; meanwhile I'm being garnished 10% because of their negligence. I've told everybody I talk to "Don't go to Jackson Hewitt." I sincerely hope with all these law suits, the AUTHORITIES WILL SHUT THEM DOWN. (Of course, let the people get their settlements FIRST!)
My husband and I went to file our taxes in December '06 so we would get a tax anticipation loan for $500.00 before Christmas. We received it no problem; then when January 06 came we were offered another loan for $2,000.00 off our last paycheck stubs, so we did that no problem. Then when we got our w-2's we went back to get the rest. On average we get back around 6,000.00 a year. About a month later my husband received a phone call from Jackson Hewett telling him he needed to pick up a check for just under $2,000.00 that we still had there; we told them we already picked up the check. They said no, we still have one more check; this brought us to about 8,000.00 this year. We argued that was too much, but they told us that tax laws change all the time and that was right, cashed it with no problem. Two to three months later we started to get bills for the last check from HSBC (where we cashed it) stating that we must not have filed our taxes--please do so. Jackson Hewitt was not helpful. I now get bills piling up from HSBC, and the amount owed is now also on my credit report. No one at Jackson Hewett wants to know anything about this problem. I thought they had to pack up what they file. I have a worse credit rating and owe money I cannot afford to pay back. This upsets me, and I get sick to my stomach--I trusted them wholeheartedly.
I went to Jackson Hewitt to file my taxes in Jan. of 2006. I had all of my paycheck stubs and was intending to get what they call a money now loan on my anticipated tax refund. When I went in, a tax preparer and her assistant began typing up all of my paycheck stubs for the year. When they began my return they asked me how I was going to file; I didn't know which was better--joint or married, but both of them told me I should just file single. This sounded very fishy to me, so I asked the office manager the same question. She stated yes, a lot of people do it that way. Therefore I had confidence that I would be ok, but just in case I purchased a gold claim guarantee. Well, I applied for financial aid to go back to school and was selected for a Dept. of Education audit based on my FAFSA responses which showed I was married during the time of my 2006 returns; but my returns were not showing this. I knew then why I had been audited. I contacted the IRS, and they informed me that I had filed incorrectly based from a few questions they asked me. They stated I needed to amend my taxes to reflect my married status. I contacted Jackson Hewitt to have them assist me with this and submit my gold guarantee but was unable to get a response from the local main office. I called customer service and they submitted a case to have someone call me. I did not get a response from anyone for a week so I submitted a BBB complaint. The Jackson Hewitt office responded and asked that I come in to amend my taxes. I went in today and filed and was told that I now owe $1600 to the IRS. I asked the office manager when my gold guarantee would be submitted, and she told me that it would not be covered because my paperwork showed that I was single and no indication of marriage was on my paperwork. I asked her why any paperwork would show me to be married if I was advised by my preparer to file as single. She stated that this was just hearsay and could not be covered by the guarantee I purchased. I am still in progress with the BBB and have gotten in contact with a corporate manager for help with this. Can I legally get a lawyer to have my gold guarantee approved due to the misguidance? I want resolution to my issue. Jackson Hewitt is a dirty company to do business with. I hope the media can get a hold of them one day.
I just purchased a 2001 Jaguar S-type, it had 42,000 miles. Ive had this car for only a few weeks (I haven't received my title in the mail yet) and already, I have problems with the transmission. When I park the car at an incline the car is stuck in Park. In an attempt to take the gear off of park, i broke the gear switch. This happened yesterday. Today in an attempt to get info on how to solve my dilema I see all these complaints on the same issue. What to do? I can not afford to spend money on an ongoing issue. Im afraid to take it to the dealership in White Plains, NY because of the pricey outcome it may bring. Any advice??
I filed my taxes for 2003 with Jackson Hewitt. I was suppose to receive $3149.00. The deductions Jackson Hewitt took out are the following. 1.my refund acct fee 25.00 2.tax prep.paid to J.Hewitt 177.00 3.Doc prep. paid to J.Hewitt 39.00 4.Gold Gaurantee pd to J.Hewitt 29.00 5.Delinquent dept to RAL lender 2174.57 The amount that i received in total was 704.43. The fees i agreed to have deducted. I of course questioned the delinquent debt. I was told i owed this money for my return back in 1994. I made serveral calls asking why they believe i owe this money. All i was told was that i received a loan and didnt pay it back. Jackson Hewitt refused to sent me proof on the matter. I happened to find my refund paper work for 1994. My refund that year was about $1400.00. I then called again asking If you are correct on this matter why was 2174.57 deducted when my refund amount was only 1400.00? I was told 2174.57 was deducted because that is the amount owed. I dont know how many phone calls i made or how many people i talked to, but i do know i got absolutly nowhere and didnt know what else i could do. Recently I received the court ordered refund notice on the case of THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA VS. JACKSON HEWITT. After reading this i went to this website and it states that Jackson Hewitt was involed in illegal debt collection. I believe i was a victim of illegal debt collection. It caused financial burdon and humiliation being spoken to as if i had stolen this money from them.
Jackson Hewitt filed my taxes on 3-16-07. They could not give me a cost because they said they charge per form and the computer would generate the fee. It took the lady 1 1/2 hour to do them and the charge was $304. That was $200.00 per hour. My attorney does not charge that much. I think this company is ripping people off with their high charges. I called a supervisor and he said he would look into it and call me back but now all the offices are closed for the season and I guess it's just my tough luck. There are many complaints on them. Can't something be done to a company that has such unethical practices? I am a retired senior and I feel I was cheated out of my money.
My husband and I have used Jackson Hewitt for the last four years to prepare our taxes. The last three were unremarkable. Fair prices and great services. Until this last year. My husband and I thought that we were participating in the rapid refund (RAL). Instead of getting our check within two days it took 16 days longer than turbo tax. Then are charge for prepartion was $336.00. Last year we paid $110.00.
In 2005 I file my income tax with Jackson Hewitt. My refund was $8,173 I was shock since it was the first time I got that much back. My husband and I question the Jackson Hewitt tax preparer, Israel Vasquez, about it. He was insulted and stated he knew what he was doing. In February 2007 I received a letter stating I owe $3,640 due to the fact Jackson Hewitt did not correctly prepare our 2005 return. At the time we were preparing the taxes they sold me a 'gold guarantee' which stated that if they made any mistakes in preparing the taxes they would pay anything owed up to $5000. I contacted their office since Feb.20 2007 and spoke Ed, who said That Israel Vasquez doesn't work their any more. I gave Ed the letter from the IRS stating I owe. He pulled my files and confirmed that mistakes were made by the preparer. He made copies of the letter from the IRS,then said he would turn the paperwork over the their Francshise manager, Chris. She kept avoiding my phone call. I went to the office, she stated the files were in the corporate office with their lawyers. I wait several days without any response. I went into the office and spoke to Chris who gave me the runaround about her computer was not working and she had transfer the file to Marcia at another Jackson Hewitt location to check the Gold Guarantee statis. I ask her how come she told me it was in the main office. After several days calling she finally had me sign a cover sheet confirming that the Gold Guarantee is in effect and they will investigate and contact me.  Several days went by so I called the district manager Stan F and explained the situation and he said he would contact me later that day, he never did and has been avoiding me since then.
They prepared my 2005 tax return. In January of 2007 I received a letter rom the IRS stating that my 2005 taxes were done incorrectly and that I owe them $7000. Fortunately, i did pay for their Gold Guarantee plan which would hold Jackson-Hewitt repsonsible for any error made. I received a check for $5000 to send to the IRS which I did. I received another letter from the IRS stating that I know owe the remaining balance of $2200. Of that $2200 I am responsible for $683.00 which I have no problem paying, the remaining balance is penalties and interest. I contact Cindy at Jackson-Hewitt explaning the letter and I fax the letter to her on 3/31/07 have been not heard any response from her. I have been calling and leaving message all week and have not been getting a phone calls back. Today I left a message with the district manger Linda Baer and no response yet. I have until 4/25/07 to respond back the the letter from the IRS and if no response they will continue to add penatlies and interest. I don't know where to go from here or who to contact. I will never deal with Jackson Hewitt again.
I went to them to file my taxes they filed them so i would get a rapid refund they charged me 800 and said it would take 2-10 days -- it took 3 1/2 weeks so when i went to pick up my check i asked if i would be getting some of my money back since it wasnt a rapid refund, they said no. Then they said my state check would be coming in to them when i went to pick it up they said they had put it together with the other check but none of my paper work stated that.
I have filed with Jackson Hewitt since 2001. I filed my 2004 and 2005 taxes as normal during the proper filing times. The preparer's asked if I had been separated from my husband during the tax year of which I had. She stated that she would file me as HOH and get me some more money. Well, this presented a HUGE problem because apparently if the couple is back together at the end of the tax year, they must file MFJ or MFS, not HOH. They said I had to get it amended in order to get financial aid. I went to Jackson Hewitt in January 2007 to do this amendment for both 2004 and 2005, since they had prepared each incorrectly. I added my husband and his income and changed our status to MFJ for both years. They stated I would receive my refunds within 8 weeks. After waiting 10 I called the IRS, who told me a letter for each year was being sent to me because the amendments were done incorrectly!!! I purchased gold guarantees for both tax years that state that in the event they make an error, they will pay up to $6K to correct it, however when I mentioned it to the branch manager, she pretty much told me that they would find a loop hole around that, because I'd be dealing with an insurance company, and you know how insurance companies are!
I went to JH in January to pre-file my taxes and get a refund anticipation loan. The gentleman filled it all out according to my last pay stub, and I was on my way with my $416.25. He anticipated my refund to be $1573.00. I return later in January to file, and they have made mistake- he put my social security income in as my federal income- only a 3-4 thousand dollar mistake. The lady tells me sorry, you’re responsible. Then she tells me "Well, we will make up some creative deductions to cover this...don’t worry, I’m going to lie for you". I was taken aback, and almost laughed because I work for the US government. Had it been done right, I would have never gotten the RAL, and I would not owe the bank $416.00.
I have been getting charged $32.00 unknowingly by Jackson Hewitt each year. This fee is listed as other items purchased from Jackson Hewitt with no other explanation. The $32.00 charge was explained to me as "an unknown fee". However, I saw there was a certificate for Gold Protection through Jackson Hewitt. I called the man who did my taxes and he said "oh, that just automatically gets put on there”, but he would remove it. I called his supervisor and asked if they receive commission from the gold protection plan. She stated yes and I went on to ask her if that's automatically added on as a fee. She stated they must offer the product to you, and then give you a chance to accept or decline. She tells me it is impossible to remove the charge. $32.00 might not seem like much, but to a single mother it's 3 nights of dinner. And when I think about how they are getting a percentage of that money, it makes me SICK.
I file EIC as most single mothers due and it cost me 486.00. People I have spoken with spent less. I was told it depends how complicated my taxes are. I only filed my EIC, a christmas club for 25.00 and a student loan for 100.00. How complicated is that? They can not tell you how much it cost, only to say depends on which jackson hewitt I go to and how complicated my taxes are. As a single parent 488.00 is very pricey. I have not had any hardship over this, I just fell someone needs to step in and say there should be a cap on the amount charges and prices displayed
I was overcharged for tax services and promised a reimbursement. I complained to the Office of the Attorney General and Jackson Hewitt did an about turn and refused the reimbursement but would agreed to re-do my taxes at any additional cost to me. I refused this offer because I had already paid the IRS. This company doesn't let you know what your fees are going to be upfront. They claim they don't know what the fees are until the taxes are completed because the computer generate the charges. When you ask that your documents be returned then you are told that they can only give you copies. Because the tax process has started and you need to pay for any tax time but they don't know how much until the taxes are totally completed. This company is a bully and needs to be stopped. The personnel at Jackson Hewitt misleads use regarding charges and hold your documents as hostage espcially if it is close to April 15th. The staff are under trained regarding tax issues but smart enough to get your money and give poor service. I also complained to the Better Business Bureau but was told that Jackson Hewitt would not respond. This complaint started April 16, 2005 with me requesting $196 refund of the $476 paid to Jackson Hewitt. Now, I want to suit for the entire amount.
A person went into this office posing as my daughter I was out of state she only had my ss # and she did my taxes she spoke to victor and he said it was ok since I was in another state. She had no power of attorney or nothing. She even picked up my check for me.Just think how easy it is to do a fradulent return, any one can sign your name to a return in this office, not one checks anything, my DL and name are different they even took a picture of this.
I used turbo tax this year and a friend of mine had one for last year. I redid my taxes for the prior year and instead of owing I should have received a refund of $787. I contacted Jackson Hewitt and my son's social security benefits should not have been included in the amount that I was taxed on. They did not seem to know about this and they redid my taxes which only should have taken 5 minutes instead took an hour. I had to pay the government $400 and I just want people to know that these people do not know that child benefits should not be included in income and the child under 18 should file him or herself. Who knows how many customers they have screwed out of money that is owed to them or how many people had to pay that shouldn't have.
4/2005 Fed Income Tax return disbursed in a Jackson Hewitt Cash card that I NEVER received cash or signed for receipt of. Jackson Hewitt associates have been very nonchalant about this matter and dragging their feet in a inconsiderate and most unprofessional manner. Lost $2600.
I went in to Jackson Hewitt to get my taxes done on 2/17/06 and a young lady by the name of Kara helped me. She had enter my W-2 information, but was having problems with entering my 1099 for my start up business and she called the maanger Pat over to help. Well he told her to merge all four of my 1099 together and make it 1, so that what I thought happen. Well after completing my paper work I thought everything was good. I signed up for their Gold Guarantee Program just in case they made a mistake. On March 29th when I was complete my daughters financial Aid papers I notice that the 1099 space was 0 for 1099's being issued. So I go in to talk with the manager about this problem and he said, It doesn't matter you got your refund! I then told him, It does matter, and I would like to the error fixed! Pat said, Well we can amend the tax return, but did you get a letter from the IRS yet? ... I was very upset that he would not fix my tax return then and that he was very rude! The problem is I was entitled to a refund, but they gave me too much of a refund because they left out my 1099's, which caused me to owe the IRS $748.00 back! Well In filing a claim with their GOLD Guanartee Program they are trying to said I made the mistake, because I signed my tax return as complete and that I did not give my 1099's at the time I got my taxes prepare with them. Which is a LIE!
Jackson Hewitt prepared my Income taxes in 2003 and made a huge mistake on the amount of Mortgage interest to claim. this left me owing the IRS over $1,898.20 with interest. I paid for a Gold Guarantee insurance to cover myself in case of mistakes, now the company is refusing to pay. I have been contacting this company since September of 2005.
I went to Jackson Hewitt to get my income tax prepared back in February of this year(2006). My federal return had turned out to be okay, but just because I didn't know the assess value of my house off hand the preparer took it upon himself to not completely do my state taxes. This made a big difference in my refund. I knew that something was not right, so the next day I called the office and explain to the lady who answered the phone that I didn't think my state taxes had been prepared properly because i'm use to getting a bigger refund from the state. She then asked me if I had all of my forms when I came and I told her yes. She looked up my return and told me that the guy that prepared my taxes had access to look up the assesed value of my home and should have done so. She also told me to come in that very day because she have to put in to have my state taxes amended and I would have to come in to get the papers so I could mail them right away. I immediately went in, got the forms, and mailed the right away. It was a $770 difference in my return!
I referred a close friend, he had his 2005 taxes filed March 20 with them choosing a rapid refund 3-5 days and was told it could take up to 1 month. Speaking very little English he called several times and I called once only to be told the check was not there yet. After 1 month he was called and asked his ss number and asked me to return the call. I did and was told someone had stolen his check and that nothing could be done for him for 10 days until the police report was available. The check was there on March 21, a report was not filed until April 3. He wasn't notified until April 7.He had borrowed money up to $4000.00 now he must suffer and is the loser.
I went to Jackson Hewitt to file my taxes and I put them on hold I then changed my mind and requested my paper work back and they lost them and didn't know what to tell me to do.
Mrs. W messed up my income tax return. she filed me as head of the house and I told her several times I was not. She had a nasty attitude with me. She did not ask me all the questions on her screen and became frustrated when I asked her to go back because I was trying to show she was wrong. she forgot to credit me for my school money, then had to go back to do that. when I confronted her with my problem she just got done my boyfriends tax return. he too had a problem with her not explaining the fee to him. She had an attitude still and got another woman to come over and talk with us. She left before resolving the problem herself leaving it up to her coworkers to fix because she had somewhere to be.
She was very unprofessional throughout our working relationship; and did not pay me for all of the hours I worked (5 hours short) plus mileage for attending an Office Manager's Training Session (80 miles round trip at $.485 per mile). I do expect to be paid for ALL of the hours I worked. Also, after starting in December 2005, I discovered that the Tax Forms for 2003 and 2004 were not being kept under lock and key. These forms have very personal data including Social Security Numbers. With today's problems in identity theft, I found this to be extremely dangerous and very unprofessional. I was not willing to be responsible, so in order to correct this situation I purchased two file cabinets that locked. Although I was not reimbursed for my purchased in professionalizing the office as directed in our Office Manager Training Class, I did feel it was important enough to correct this problem. I still feel this situation could exist in other offices and needs to be looked into.
Had my income taxes prepared. They sent me my completed taxes but used my W-2's from both 2003 & 2004!!! When I was told I owed nearly $500 (I usually get a refund), I questioned that. They said they would review it again & have someone in Corporate review it again for accuracy. I received it the other day in the mail & immediately noticed they added a W-2 from 2003 which made my income almost $11,000 higher!!! This explains it! They pulled a 2003 W-2 from last year's file. The W-2 says in large numbers "2003". NEVER will I use this company again. I called the manager & she stated that this happens all the time. I just cannot believe the "Experts" they claim to be could not do a simple income tax return properly! Here it is, April 13th & now they have to redo my taxes at this late date! They do NOT know what they are doing & don't really seem to care.
