I paid them for a service and they never returned the phone call; kept the money and did not produce the product. Eventually, the tax situation was resolved on its own. JK Harris lies, can't believe any of their promises. There should be a special 'place' (not just referring to jail, either) for the people who work for JK Harris cheating those who are genuinely in need. read more hide
About 2-3 years ago, I enlisted the firm of J K Harris to help me with my tax situation. I had paid them close to $2,000.00 to help me. I had received a phone call from them and was asked to pay additional monies for their services. I did not send any other money as I thought something strange is happening. I learned 3 days later that J K Harris is out of business and went bankrupt. Is there any way I can recover the initial money I paid upfront for them to help me. I have since enlisted another firm to help me, 2020 tax resolution of which to this point I am satisfied. Thank you. read more hide
DO NOT USE JK HARRIS!!! THEY ARE SLOPPY AND THEY LIE! My husband and I sought their help after several failed attempts to set up a payment plan on our own. JK Harris, specifically Rick **, promised to help set up a payment plan or get the IRS to settle our debt for less. We had to pay for every little thing they did and ended up spending $3,500. I spent hours/days gathering up all the necessary paperwork JK Harris required and faxed and mailed it over.... several times! It seemed as though they would always misplace the paperwork. They asked me for things over and over again. They also switched us from rep to rep, which was part of the problem. When it was finally time to submit the paperwork to the IRS, they addressed the envelope to the Ohio office! When we got yet another IRS letter saying they intended to levy, two months after we submitted our paperwork with JK Harris, my husband called the IRS. They said the paperwork was sent to the wrong office and we would have to resubmit everything to the correct one. When we contacted JK Harris, they wanted to charge us to do so!! It was their fault! They also wanted to release themselves from being the Power of Attorney and they suggested we deal with it ourselves. We tried contacting Rick ** who originally signed us up several times and he ignored every single one of our calls! We ended up paying the IRS $5,000 to set up our own payment plan! We could have used the $3,500 JK Harris TOOK from us to do that and avoid the headache! THEY ARE SCAM ARTISTS! DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!!!!! I WANT MY MONEY BACK JK HARRIS!!! read more hide
I contacted a lady by the name of ** from St.Louis area who worked for JK Harris. She agreed to take the case with the IRS and she wanted 4200.00. I never heard from her again until one year later the IRS shut down my bank accts. I owed 15000.00 and ended up paying 27,500.00 that I had to pull out of my retirement fund which cost me 65000.00 because I had to pay taxes and penalties on early withdraw. I also had to take one year off work in order to withdraw the funds because my union does not let a person take early withdraw unless its twelve months after last contribution. So in all this cost me $165000.00. Is there any way to recover my lost money. Most people spend life in prison for this crime. Are there any lawsuits against this company? I have every intention of filing criminal charges and a lawsuit against this Company and **. read more hide
My father having been under constant duress for a filing error years earlier, contacted JK Harris to assist him. Having recently been granted social security, the IRS began taking about 70 percent of his check leaving him unable to maintain even a modest standard of living. Upon initial contact he was given assurances that they would work on his behalf and presumably at least try to get the deduction reduced so he would have enough money to live and having something resembling a normal life. He sent them a payment of 5000 dollars. Over the next few months he continued to send them payments until it reached about 10,000 dollars. At this point he started contacting customer service for an update of what was happening..... He never heard from them again. No calls were returned and no work was ever done on his behalf. My father used the last of his money with the hopes that JK Harris could help him. They never did a thing. Never returned the many calls of inquiry. They simply took his money, presumably figuring he was out of money and options and would have no recourse against them, leaving him high and dry. I cannot tell you how disappointed we are with them and I would strongly advise anyone against using their "services." They are a morally bankrupt company preying upon those that are in the most need of help. Shameful. Just shameful business practices. read more hide
In 2010 I went to JK Harris to prepare federal and state back taxes for me and at the time felt these people had my best interest at heart. As time went on, at each visit, more money was asked of me consisting of filing fees, legal fees, court fees, etc. I was well over $6000 in the hole but everything was dragging on. Though the back taxes were filed, they stalled when it came to honoring the promise of cutting the amount I owed in half. In the end I ended up going to the IRS and doing the job myself. I had no problems and was out of $6000. I wasn't aware of any legal problems until several years later. Of course now I've received notice from my state that my 2009 taxes were not filed,. I don't know how this could be since the other prior years were filed. Anyway, here I go again! I hope there's a class action suit against this man/company. I want my money back! read more hide
Well, I had to pay them back taxes I did not know about because I was on disability. JK Harris and for almost 2 years I kept calling and calling him. I couldn't get anywhere. Finally IRS came after me because they did not do what they said they were going to do. Well by this time I was off disability and I had regained my old job back and since I hadn't encountered and the IRS said I had to pay my taxes, well I got honors class action lawsuit against JK Harris. I got $25 back and I had to pay all my back taxes and all my fines and everything. I was on a disability policy. Was there not supposed to have to pay taxes on but the way they wrote it up is I had to pay taxes on it but it took three years later after I was on disability before I got the newsletter from the IRS saying I owe them taxes which I did not know or I would have paid him. JK Harris robbed me. You stole my money. Can call whenever you want. They took my money and did not perform a service. I guess that's wassup the service and I got $25 back of the class action lawsuit. I got a check from the lawyers that represented the lawsuit. I never even bothered cashing a check. I just put it in a frame and put it up on my desk to remind me that you can contact the IRS for $175 filing fee and do this on your own. read more hide
We went to JK Harris back in 2003. We were in tax trouble. At that time, we had to pay $500.00 and they would help us with the IRS so they could not take anything from us. They did, indeed, do what they said and once JK Harris did what they do - I never heard another word from the IRS - not one letter and not one word. I have long since paid off the balance owed to the IRS but with absolutely no problems. I never had a problem with JK Harris and was able to reach them. I don't know what has happened over the years because back then - they were very good. read more hide
In 2006, I contacted JK Harris. After submitting all the paperwork and docs, along with $4000.00, several months later with nothing more than promises, the case was dismissed. They did nothing at all. All the money was lost, without much of explanation. Contacting them was a joke. read more hide

They would send us paperwork, we filled it out and sent it back - and this went on and on. They always gave us the excuse that they wanted the same information over and over again. It was endless. In the end, we invested money into believing they could help us with back taxes owed and they did nothing for us. I would never recommend this company to anyone. They are also very rude on the phone when you finally do get to speak with a representative. Oh, and they hand off your case to a new specialist every other month, which you have to start over the entire process again. read more hide
I just found out today, Jan 7th, 2013, that I was scammed by this crook and scum, JK Harris. I am a disabled person who, like others, was subject to the barrage of TV commercials touting the tax services they offered. Heck, they even had a local office I could go to. It was in that face to face office meeting that I was scammed out of $1,000 and never got a single service for that. I had called my JK Harris rep and got nothing but lies. "Oh, you didn't send this form or that form." But I had. When at last I went one on one with the IRS, I informed them that JK Harris was working on my behalf. "Ah, no they are not" was the IRS reply. "They have never contacted us on your behalf." The state I live in has sued JK Harris. Why as a customer of JK Harris was I never contacted about any of this? Why didn't the state of Tennessee contact me in regards to the local office I was scammed by? The state included that local office in their lawsuit. Angry? You could say that! I remember the face of that man on TV, JK Harris. I hope I never run into that guy. He must be living under a rock at this point as there are many who would love to have a go at him. Scamming anyone is beyond shameful. Scamming a disabled person, hey, JK, it's called hell and you are going there. read more hide
Several years ago, my husband went to JK Harris about helping us resolve tax issues. My husband was led to believe he was speaking with an attorney from the firm. Later, he found out he was not. This young man promised he could remove liens and assured us that they would go to battle for us. This did not happen after paying them over $5000. The girl who would call who was responsible for our case became very rude and acting 20 times worse than any IRS agent would ever do. My husband informed them that he is and has S Corp. papers, being a complete independent contractor. They did nothing, gave us no information that S. Corp would have kept us from overpaying taxes, which resulted in a trickle down effect. JK Harris caused our family undue stress and made matters so much worse for us. There is no excuse for this behavior and it's a total ripoff of money, plus me doing a lot of their job. They were paid to do it, not me. I feel like JK Harris law firm needs to be investigated and license removal is appropriate due to lies, not representing clients correctly and no regard at all to acting on behalf of us and many more of their clients. It's inexcusable knowing what I know now. I feel a total refund is due to my family, plus interest, plus mental emotional distress due to scheming, lies, and unprofessional to say the very least. I am on medication because of them, and I am still having to take it. They owe my family and many countless others. read more hide
I went to JK Harris some years ago and they promised me that they would take care of my IRS if I would pay them $25,000 to get started. The man in the office showed me letters from customers that they had helped.

Because of the pressure IRS put me under, I am now unable to work due to disability. Thanks JK Harris for giving me total hell. read more hide

I went to JK Harris for help with taxes owed from a business I owned with my ex-husband. I was left with the taxes, 3 children and unable to pay. I allowed JK Harris to do a biweekly deduction from my bank account for help on my situation, $2,500.00 that I could not afford, but wanted to resolve the tax issue. They did nothing! They made sure they took my money! I tried emailing and calling and just got the runaround for months, only to find out they went bankrupt! I want my money back. I worked hard for what I paid them.

I paid JK Harris $1,500 to help me with tax issue; instead, I was bilked out of my money and no one helped me with anything.

I have paid over $3,000 to JK Harris to help my husband get over his tax debt. He cannot read, and Jeanine sympathized with me by telling me her father was the same way. What a joke. They reeled me in and then cast me aside when the money went through. I am a disabled woman. I have been disabled since May 2003. My life sucks, anyway. I married my husband unaware of the tax debt he had. I still love him and have tried every avenue to get it reduced to something he can pay. I believe JK Harris is a farce. They cheat people out of their money, Social Security disability money; and they tell them lies and that everything will be alright. Well, they are crooks.

I paid JK Harris for them to file an OIC for my husband and I in 2011 for back taxes owed since 2001. I gave them $6,000.00 and I should have just set it on fire because they did absolutely nothing to help me. The only thing they did do is put me in more debt. I will have to move out of my house into an apartment to try and cut back on expenses. I hope that someone sees this and offers some kind of guidance because I am at my wit's end with this.

One year, my friend did taxes for me and filed under small business. It was wrong. I let a couple of years go by until I went to file through JK Harris and let them know I needed to have taxes from that year corrected before I could file other taxes. Later, I found out (within cancellation time) that I was having someone else do my taxes due to the fact JK Harris said they couldn't go back that far to do that year. The person I hired could and did and I got all my taxes straightened out by him. Meanwhile, the struggle to get my $575.00 back that I put down was a joke! The finance portion of the company said they had to wait and investigate what cost was incurred before they could refund my money. I said there should be no cost. They didn't even get any of my information yet since I cancelled so quickly after finding out they couldn't even do the job. After a few months, they sent me a paper to sign to not proceed with any other action and accept $250.00 of my $575.00! I wrote back telling them I wouldn't sign anything of any sort since they never received any of my paperwork to even start anything concerning my taxes. I sued them in court and won due to no acknowledgement from them and I still never got my money. I'm on disability and a limited income from only that source and JK Harris and their people must be living like fat cats off everyone’s money they stole. read more hide
I found JK Harris in Wilmington, NC and the person that was supposed to help me was Ken **. I gave him over $1500 and then he moved about 2 hours away. I did go to see him once and then I would never get a return email back. JK Harris said that they wouldn't do anything until I paid another $3000. They were supposed to have me on a payment plan and they did nothing except kept all my original files and rip me off. I found the son of the owner of JK Harris in an office in South Park and I met with him and explained my situation. He told me a bunch of **, that Ken ** was no longer with them and that they cleaned house from the people that were making their company look bad. I asked him what about my money and how could they help me. He said that their policy since it was with Ken **, there was really nothing that they could do. I asked him about my tax issue and he told me that just don't answer any phone calls and it would go away. Yeah, right. JK Harris is the biggest crook out there, ** to the max. The son can go ** himself. JK Harris should be in jail since they are crooks. I have nothing good to say about them and they should be ashamed of themselves ripping off people that need some type of assistance. I cleared up my issue by calling the IRS directly and working things out with them. If anybody needs any type of IRS or credit help, do not use JK Harris. They will rip you off and lie to you. read more hide
Misrepresentation caused financial distress: We were also dealing with JK Harris after my husband had problems with the IRS changing his tax status and my becoming ill. They promised immediate help in order to keep a lien off our property and wages from being garnished, and they said they could remove the penalties. After paying them our $5,000, we went through constant lost paperwork, talking to the IRS ourselves, because they didn't. And finally, there's no contact. We are now in bankruptcy, because finances spiraled out of control and the money we paid to them was coming from our already minus one-strapped income being that I couldn't work. I wish my husband had never called them. read more hide
We met with JK Harris almost four years ago. We signed a contract and paid over $2,500.00. JK Harris' workers are incompetent, to say it nicely. They did our paper work three times and had everything so messed up. I don’t know where they got their info from but it wasn't the info we gave them! In January of 2012, we then talked with a lady at JK Harris who said it was almost done and here we are four years later and $2,500.00 broker. Prior to JK Harris, we went through tax resolution out of California and they were $4,500.00 and did nothing. Then we get a letter about fraudulent activity from the government, concerning doing business with that company. I am not sure if the tax resolution company here on this site that is advertising for customers is the same one or not. As of now, I am pissed off at JK Harris and all tax companies. Resolute Tax Service is saying they can help you if you’re a former JK Harris customer. Yes, I checked it out and they want money too. There has to be an honest company who deals with IRS issues who are not out just for the buck! This is **, and yes, I am freaking pissed off. Suck us all dry then file bankruptcy, what the hell is this crap anyways? This should not be legal. I will be contacting the court where JK Harris filed bankruptcy, I will also find out who bought out JK Harris' clients, someone had to have had it for cheap. Anyone have any ideas or who is honest to do taxes besides Tax R Us, Tax Fix, fake names but anyone with tax in it, I don’t trust. I’ve been there, done that and running a second one with the company at Resolute Tax, former JK Harris clients attention. Yeah, suck us dry some more!

JK Harris promised me (in a contract) to resolve my back tax issues and to work out a settlement with the IRS. They did nothing. I paid them more than $5000 over a period of 2 years. Again, they did nothing. Finally, I got tired of inaction and contacted the IRS myself. I filed all of my own tax returns for the back tax years. I made an agreement with the IRS, and I am on a payment plan right now - all of my own doing, and nothing from JK Harris. I have sent them certified mail requests for refunds. They even agreed to return a majority of my funds with a deduction of several hundred dollars for nothing, and I have still not received a dime. This has been a four-year mess and this is with signed agreements from JK Harris to refund my money. Still, not a penny. These people should be in jail, but the government allows them to continue to be thieves and liars. read more hide

It is unfortunate that people in difficult situations seeking help from JK Harris are now in even a more difficult situation and more in debt than they started with.

My mom hired JK Harris & Co. for her tax issues for tax year of 2007. We gave them like $4,000 to help us out they never resolved anything. We had to keep sending all our expenses every quarter that never changed for us. They expected us do a lot of the research. Then months went by, they told us that we didn't send in the info they needed so our account was dropped and then our account had to be reinstated and have to give them about another $900 to do this. We tried to contact them several times also and they never returned our calls. Then when we got in touch with them, they said our offer and compromise was there now. My mom sent the IRS $500 to get the process started. Then we get a phone call from the IRS that JK Harris & Co. went bankrupt. We have to hire another power of attorney. So we did got another lawyer and he helped us out getting us to pay with the $500. We owe the IRS $1,500. It took our lawyer half the time that JK Harris had our case for a few years. They weren't nice people to deal with and very rude. I think something has to be done for the people that got scammed. Is there anything as a consumer we can do to get some money back? We are hopeful something will be done for all these people. We had a very bad experience. Please email me or call me at the number listed. Thank you and hope to talk soon. read more hide

My older brother went to JKH in February of 2008. He died unexpectedly in March of 2008, and we found papers from JKH while going through his affairs for his non-English speaking wife. We called the local office, and they refused to even admit that he was a client. So I asked a hypothetical question - what would you advise the family of a person who died unexpectedly while a client of JKH to do? Eventually, the 2nd person I talked to promised to send information on where to send a copy of the death certificate and other information, saying it would come to the client's address. No such information ever came. Eventually, we contacted a JKH national VP through their website, and got condolences and more promises of help. We did finally get information on where to send the death certificate, and received additional promises of help. All they ever actually did was pass the case from agent to agent to agent, requiring new signatures on paperwork with every agent change, and not doing anything at all. When I tried to contact that same VP again, she was no longer there. One time, my younger brother did talk to someone on the phone who seemed to understand what was going on and what was needed, but she sent paperwork requiring a signature from our older brother, who had been deceased more than 2 years at that point. JKH is a waste of time and money, and our sister-in-law's case only came to a resolution when her employer instructed his lawyer to assist her in the matter so her wages wouldn't be garnished, $865 down the drain. Basically, we want to try to make sure that no one else ever gets stuck dealing with these scam artists. read more hide

We are small business owners that, like everyone else, has been struggling to make ends meet, thanks to the economy crunch. So we hired JK Harris to help us with back taxes and current taxes since we've had no business, which means "no income" since 2010! They gladly took our $5k+ and did nothing for us! We were told that they had filed everything so we would be in compliance with the IRS and not accumulate anymore fees or interest. We’re getting certified letters from the IRS, so that tells me they did nothing. They said they were! They were still drafting $425 every two weeks from our account even though they are "out of business" and filed bankruptcy! You took our $5k+ and did nothing for us! They were still drafting $425 every two weeks from our account even though they are "out of business" and filed bankruptcy! What do we do? Where! What do we do? Where do we go from here?

I have received a check for $13 and $16 as my settlement? Of course, the tax debt has continued to grow and I have no funds to pay for any help as I counted on the settlement. read more hide
I hired JK Harris to help with my back taxes. I paid them over $7000.00. I wasn't satisfied, and they offered to refund approximately $4500 of my money. I signed an agreement accepting the money, but they never paid me! The agreement was prior to their bankruptcy, and I don't know where to file a claim for my money. Looks like fraud to me! read more hide
I called the lawyer three times and left a message from my cell phone and he was not returning my calls. Then I called him from my other cell phone and he answered my call and told me he would call me right back. When he called me back, he told me that JK Harris is going bankrupt and another lawyer was taking over my case. No one has yet to call me back. I gave him $1700 the first time and then gave him $500. His name is Anthony **. read more hide

I became a J.K. Harris customer in 2011 and paid them $4000 to assist me with my back taxes. Communication was great. I spoke with a lady name Sherry B. in the corp. office. She requested more information from me via US mail. I just got the letter back in the mail stating by the post office that it was undeliverable. I called the 800 number many times and my local contact and the numbers are disconnected. Pissed! I feel like I just got stabbed in the heart! read more hide
We hired JK Harris to help us with getting our taxes straightened out. We paid them a large amount to file our taxes which they did. When that was finished we had other tax business they needed to handle and we agreed to let them withdraw $868.75 every 2 weeks from our account, which they did 12 times for a total of $10,425 but they never did what they were suppose to do and took our money. We would talk to someone in the office and they would assure us they were working on it but then one day we called and the number was disconnected and we read on the computer they filed bankruptcy. I want our money back! I have my bank statement were they took the money and now we have no money and our taxes are not straight. I am livid and I want something done. These people stole from my family and need to pay! read more hide

JK Harris sucks. I joined them in January 2011 thinking I was going to get help with my IRS debt. In fact, like everyone else, all JK Harris did was make my situation worse and now I have the IRS about to garnish my wages and I'm a single mother of 2 and JK Harris stole about $4,000 from me and my children. Thanks JK Harris for nothing. My overall rating isn't even 1 star but I had to select that. read more hide
After I got divorced, I lost my job. Since I was paying for several mortgages and could not liquidate any assets due to the economy, I got behind on my taxes, and I was underwater on my mortgages. Like many others, I hired JK Harris for $4,000 to resolve my tax problems. This was in October of 2011. They did file my 2010 return, but I never heard from them again. I continued to trust they were going to help me. Then, they did not return my calls, and I continued to get notices from the IRS. I didn't receive any notice of their impending bankruptcy, and just found out today after calling all their 800 numbers and the calls not going through, when I received an auto generated email with the bad news. I was on hold with the IRS for an hour, and the amounts I now owe are thousands more than when I hired JK Harris to help me. Now I don't know what I am going to do. I'm sure there will be some class action law suit but the lawyers will get most of what is recovered, and the consumers nothing. Is this the American way? Am I better off on welfare rather than being responsible and working for a living? It seems to me that is our reality. I guess I am in good company with the rest of everyone here. I went to the consultant based on a recommendation from a friend and now, I know I should have researched the company beforehand. read more hide
They have gone out of business, and they took over $4,000.00 from a disabled, divorced mother of three children. My problem with the IRS has still not been resolved. Thanks for absolutely nothing JK Harris & Company. I have been working with JK Harris for over a year. Now with penalties and interest, I owe the IRS more money than I did before I started working with JK Harris. After giving them all of my savings, I am officially broke. read more hide
I’ve paid 3550.00 dollars on May 27, 2010 to settle back taxes. I was told I needed to go back 10 years on my second appointment. Then, I was told a lady by the name of Allison ** would be handling my case. Her number is **. I`ve been working with her for a few months giving her my tax info. I’ve been trying to reach them now for a few weeks with no luck. They have taken my money and all and my tax information. They have not returned my calls nor sent me any tax documents. I went on line to their internet page and learned of all the people that have paid them like me only to be ripped off. read more hide
Hired JK Harris to help us reduce our tax department. They never returned our calls and I constantly called them. They continually sent me to new reps and 2 years later, they still had not put in our OIC. Every time I complained they said I had to resend all my financial statements because they had expired. I paid them $2400 to get things started. When I met with Jess ** he knew I was recovering from cancer and was still very ill. JK Harris would steal money from his own mother because he has no moral, ethics or human compassion. My husband and myself had to scrimp and save to make that weekly payment of $400 dollars. Maybe people wouldn't be at the mercy of scam artist if the U.S. government was willing to work with its tax payers. We got into trouble because we took money from our 401k on a hardship and was penalized. I was unable to work and the loss of my income hurt us. Is there any such thing as law. JK Harris is no better than Madoff. read more hide
I went to JK Harris back in March of 2011. They were hired to help settle a tax issue and I paid $4,800.00 to complete the federal and state issue. They never took care of the issue and levies have been placed on my wages. This company and their team should go to jail base on the results they have done to people. Rick is a person that I meet with in Portland, Oregon and looking back was no more than a used car salesman. People in this country need to wake-up with what the IRS is doing to the country. This is the most brutal agency in the country and they do not follow the will of the people. Chapter 7 should not protect these people. The victims of this scam should find these people and make them pay for what they done. They should pay everyone back that they scamed with interest. read more hide

I went to JK Harris on April 2011 for help resolve my tax problems. They charged me $2,500 or $400.00 every two weeks and $600.00 or $200.00 every two to take care of my situation. I submitted all the documents and power of attorney they requested. After several calls to them for a status reported, they finally got back to me and informed me that they were negotiating a payment plan and it will be several weeks to reach an agreement. I waited until after the holiday to call them just to find out the contact numbers I had been disconnected. I had the personal cell # to the person I first spoke with and he informed me that the company went out of business two weeks ago and he was out of work. He was concerned that nobody contacted me and suggested that I contact the IRS and set up a payment plan. I spent three (3) hours on the phone with IRS, City & State and set up a payment plan. They informed me that JK Harris did not submit documents that would have completed the final step and lowered my monthly payment. As a result, I will pay almost $1,000.00 dollar a month for almost five (5) years to pay back what I owe. Needless to say, with the economy the way it is, $1,000.00 a month is hard on me. I feel JK Harris should give me and others our money back for failure to complete their commitment. read more hide
I am writing this complaint only to help others to avoid making the same mistake that my husband and I made. Many years ago, my husband worked as a truck driver for a company that did not withhold taxes and consequently, we did not save enough to pay the total amount owed at the end of 2004. We set up a payment plan with the Internal Revenue Service and paid $200.00 per month for the next several years, but continued to get more behind because of the penalties and interest that they charged. When my husband changed jobs to work for a company that did withhold taxes, the IRS kept not only his tax returns, but mine as well. I had extra money held out of each check and they took our earned income for children as well. They took everything and we finally realized that we would never get them paid off. We decided to go to J.K. Harris who had been recommended to me by a co-worker. We paid them $1,000.00 up front and they automatically took almost $400.00 out of our checking account for the next 11 months and then our final payment for the interest that they had never discussed was almost $500.00. During all of this time, they assured us that everything was going well and the offer had been made. We were losing our home and had to file bankruptcy just before our last payment was made. The IRS sent us a package that they were denying our offer in compromise and J.K. Harris stopped taking our phone calls. Jim ** was the attorney that we had been working with in Canton, Ohio and he told me to go and stand in the poverty level line at the IRS because we would qualify for this now. He said that J.K. Harris couldn't help us and he was sorry. They had taken almost $7,000.00 and hadn't done a thing to help us. I don't know how Jim ** or John K. ** sleep at night or look at themselves in the mirror knowing what they are doing to people. They are liars and thieves and the government is letting them get away with it. We could have paid that money to the government, but they won't even help us now. I have contacted Mike **'s office and the Better Business Bureau and still nothing has been done. The IRS continues to take our money and tax returns every year and we didn't even owe them that much money in the first place. Is this really what it means to be an American? We have paid taxes our whole lives and now we can't get anyone to listen to us or help us put an end to this nightmare. The people at J.K. Harris should be in jail and the IRS should be doing more to help the people who have ended up in the same situation as we have. I have heard stories about other people who have owed taxes that they couldn't pay. Some have said that agents have come to their homes and basically told them not to worry about paying any more and their tax issues have been forgiven. Well, we don't have a home anymore and no agent has ever come to tell us anything. They just keep taking from us and I'm sure that we have paid more than we ever owed the IRS. I wasn't even working when this happened to my husband, but they continue to take my tax returns as well. Can someone tell me where the justice is in all of this? I am 52 years old and they will probably continue to take our money as long as we continue to work. I look at the people who don't work and the government provides money, housing, food, and insurance to them. Maybe they're onto something! Anyway, stay away from J.K. Harris. read more hide

My husband owes several thousands to the IRS. This is the reason for contacting an attorney or what we thought was an attorney at JK Harris. My husband began working with JK Harris over 3 years ago and we have paid them at least $3,000.00 or more. They never return your calls, they are constantly telling you they are "still working on it", they demand more money, they always have a new rep, etc. This is a bunch of bogus.

My overall rating would be "1 star". Their ad says “one call does it all". That's a lie. I was told by my rep that I met with that no one could take money out of my disability checks. Well, they did. I am disabled and live on my disability. I paid $2500.00 to J.K. Harris to handle my tax problems. Technically the problem with IRS wasn't even mine. It was my ex-husband’s. Every time I called J.K Harris' office, I was directed to a new rep. I sent in paperwork every 3 months and every time, it went to a new rep. I was told to ignore notices from IRS. This went on for over 4 years. I was told last October that everything was settled with IRS, but I continued to receive notices from IRS. I called J.K. Harris again this week to ask about the letter I was to receive from them stating that I was not responsible for the debt. I was told that I was responsible, but that I was in a "not able to pay status". So after 4 years of paperwork, phone calls, and tons of aggravation, I'm right back where I started. read more hide

I would rate JK Harris with a zero or lower if I could. My husband and I met with one of their agents when we lived in Springfield, MO. We gave him approximately $400 and signed a contract to pay over $3000 to represent us with the IRS. We sent the information they requested. We were to get a return call back each time we called their office and a call was never received. Each time we called, we were told a new rep was handling our case and that agent would return our call but never a call. I believe there were around three supposedly reps involved. I finally emailed and received a letter stating they would give us only half of our money back because of the administration fees and costs for their time. They never did anything but take our money. And the half of the refund they promised never came and again calls were not returned. read more hide
JK Harris promised to settle out tax debt, and we paid them almost $4,000.00. They made promises to us, and even filed our 2010 tax returns wrong. When we finally realized what was happening, we put a stop payment on future payments. We then got a letter from an attorney, and they are trying to sue us. They are scam artists who feed on the working class, trying to make difficult choices. We are now trying to figure out how they have the right to sue us, when they lied, and did everything different than what they promised. read more hide
For the rate your overall experience, there should be a button for losers. It would not let me pick 0. I give them nothing. I met with a sales representative of JK Harris in July 2011. I was in danger of having my wages garnished and that JK Harris could settle my tax debt pennies on the dollar. This rep pressured me to pay him $400 that day and set up a monthly pay plan of $800 a month for the balance of $3100. I was making payments to their collection agency at an 18% rate. I found out after making payments that JK Harris will not work on your case until they receive the full balance. At this time, my debt to the IRS was around $25,000 and I felt completely hopeless. I paid all the fees owed to JK Harris in Oct. 2011. For the next 4 months, JK Harris did nothing to resolve my tax issues. I had three different reps that I worked with. The representatives did not contact me. Instead, I had to call them to get updates. I paid them well to resolve my tax issues. I think we should all get together and bring JK Harris down. Is there anyone out there who would want the case against JK Harris? It would improve your business. E-mail me if you want to join. read more hide
It was the beginning of October 2008. I've seen a commercial for a company named JK Harris which quoted "we are the nation's largest tax representation firm and we guarantee to stop interest and penalty charges and to lower what you owe the IRS". I put down $1,100 up front to a guy that I thought I could trust to handle my current situation, which at that time was lower than what I owe know. Then, I was put on a monthly payment plan that I paid on time every month, which totaled to $5,000 with the interest. He gave us his cell phone number and instructed me to call him anytime if there was a problem. Shortly after a problem came up and it came time to call his number, it was no longer working. So, I called the main headquarters of JK Harris in North Charleston, SC. I talked to 10 different people before I got to the right person. She wasn't the only person handling my case. So, she couldn't give me an answer as to why the IRS was still contacting me and stating that it was an urgent matter, "we intend to levy your account". Bottom line, they did not resolve the problem. They just took my money and ran with it. read more hide
I paid JK Harris more than $3,000 to help me with a debt to the IRS. After waiting for 10 months for an answer, I got a letter on October 16, 2011 saying that I did not qualify for them to help me. As a result of this, I now owe the IRS more than I did at first, plus I have the fee they charged on my Master Card. Now, I owe the IRS more money than at first and also have a credit card bill.The bill from the IRS was a little over $5,000, but now it's almost $7,000. read more hide
I went to JK Harris believing that I was going to be helped (I was wrong). I met with Michelle ** (very nice person). I first met with her in December 2010, but I waited and then went back in June 2011 and that was when I signed up to be ripped off. So to start, I paid JK Harris $1,100.00 and also paid $700.00 toward the next step of the process (if I moved forward, then I have $700.00 as a credit) so they could get power of attorney and find out from the IRS how much I owe. So a total of $1,800, this was on June 28, 2011. Not even a week later, Michelle called and I met back with her in the office. She then advised me that it would be another $4,900 to move on; this does not include the $700.00 credit I already have. I did nothing, I told her I would call and I had to think about it. So July 2011, I decided that I just wanted my money back, at least the $700.00 credit. I had to sign and email or fax the paper back. I then finally Spoke to Trawana **. She told me that it takes 45 to 60 days to get a refund. I'm not at all happy about that, but I have waited and nothing has happened. To the point that the company now doesn't return call (not that they ever did) but now my emails don't even get answered. read more hide

I thought these jokers could help, but I was wrong. Like a lot of these people, I paid them money ($800.00). After several months, nothing. Finally, I had another meeting with a consultant at one of their many satellite offices. I owed in the neighborhood of $5000. Their offer to me was pay them another $3000 and they would settle everything with the IRS. I read the paperwork, looked at the guy and asked, "are you ** kidding me? I asked him to do the math.

My wife and I signed an agreement on 9/22/10 for services with dealing with the IRS for tax years 2007 and 2008. We paid monthly installments totaling to $2,590. We stopped automatic withdraws from our checking account because we never received a call from them or answered any of my 10+ calls to them. We wanted to know what we were getting for the money we already paid because there was no audit representation or Federal Stream Line installment Agreement. The only thing they did was ask the IRS for a Master File and IRP for 07 and 08. That cost $300.00. They also made one phone call to the IRS since I had to pay the IRS. There was nothing more for them to do. After contacting the Better Business Bureau in SC, we found out that they have had over 720 complaints against JK Harris. On 4/01/2011, they sent us an offer to pay us $690. We wanted at least $2,000 of the $2590 we paid them and got nothing at all for our money. Being seniors on limited income and having to pay the IRS $370 a month just on interest and penalties without touching the principal, we decided to settle for the $690. We signed, dated and faxed their general release back to them. I have the TX Result Report showing the faxed was received by them. After waiting for over a month, I tried calling and leaving messages but never a return call. I called the BB Bureau and they tried calling. They finally told me they would give up. HOW can a company like this still operate and cheat people out of their money, with more than 720 complaints against them? read more hide
Back in Oct 2010, I met with Scott **, representative of JK Harris, in regards to back taxes that I owe the Internal Revenue. He assured me that they are a great company and he assured me that they would help me. I felt very comfortable because I desperately wanted to resolve this issue. I gave them my checking account information to take payments electronically. I never once received any documentation stating that the work was done. He assured me that all the information went to the IRS. I have a payment agreement with the IRS faithfully every month. I have asked if anyone has been inquiring information on my behalf, the answer has been always no. Also, to file my taxes would be 30.00 because I was a customer. Once Feb 2011 came, I call to file my taxes. JK Harris told me 425.00 to file. I spoke with David **/ Micheal ** , they assured me that everything was going good and not to worry. Today almost a year later and nothing has been done. I have left messages, no call back. Please help. read more hide
I hired JK Harris in 2007 to help me with a tax issue. I was told they could help me settle the debit. All they did was drag it out for two years and in the end, the IRS garnished my Social Security Check in the amount of $250.00 per month. JK Harris did nothing to help me at all. They just charged me $4500; they stole my money. Now it's too late to do anything, and they dropped my case in 2010. With no explanation to me other than it was settled.

I have hired JK Harris to help me with my tax problem. I paid them $1350.00, and they wanted more. I really cannot afford more. Now the IRS has levied my social security by 15 percent. Each month of which, I cannot afford. It takes money from me that I need to live on. I called them to get my money back, and they told me I could not get it all.

In 2006, I was audited by IRS and owed around $23,000.00 from 2003. I hired JK Harris Firm and I paid them a total of $2,800.00 to work my case. They kept running me around and said that they were still working on it. Almost eight weeks went by, I called them and said that this is not working out and I am getting four letters a week from IRS for payment arrangements. I called JK Harris Company and told them that I wanted a refund on what I had paid them so I could start paying on this arrangement for IRS. JK Harris said that we cannot refund the money paid for the services they did. I wrote a letter to their company and finally, they sent me only seven hundred dollars and some change back. I want everything I paid and if I can get some help from a law firm in Nashville, TN, that would be great. It cost me a lot of money and added to what I owe IRS and put me further behind. We almost lost our home and put me and my wife on the verge of a nervous breakdown. We had to file bankruptcy to keep our home. read more hide
In August of 2010 I met with Mr. Frank Piecka a consultant for JK Harris to discuss my situation and to see if I qualify for their services. Mr. Piecka informed looked over the documents that I had brought with me. He determined that we needed to meet again. On September 3 of 2010 I met with Mr. Piecka he told that I did qualify for their services. Mr. Frank Peicka informed me that they would be able to gather all of my documents and determine how much I would have to pay to the Department of Revenue. At that time I was told I would need to pay them a fee of $830.00 for those services. I said wow that is a little steep. Mr. Piecka said that it might turn out that I would only minimal help from them and this would be all I would have to pay. Around Octocber I met with Mr. Piecka again. At this time he informed me that they could help me and settle my debt for a small amount. It sounded good. He also said that It would cause me $2500.00 for their lawyers and tax professionals to make sure that this small amount would be all I would have to ever pay on this debt. Once they contact Massachusette Department of Revenue with my income and ability to pay, I wouldn't have to worry about this debt any longer. I argued the fact of paying them $2500.00 plus the $830.00 I had already paid that I could have actually given this amount to Mass DOR and would have paid a third of the debt. Mr. Piecka informed me that I would continue to accure fees which would keep adding up and this small amount would not even put a dent in the debt. I contemplated this and told Mr. Piecka there is no way I have $2500.00 to do this. Mr. Piecka called someone in his home office and told them my situation. I was then informed that they could take payments and that they would use $500.00 of the $830.00 I had already paid. Mr. Peicka assured me that I would not have to pay more and that my tax problems would be resolved. I asked If his company (JK Harris) did not settle my tax debt what would happen to all of my money. He plainly said to me, then we (JK Harris) would have to give you your money back. Mr. Piecka made me feel confident that JK Harris lawyers and tax professionals would settle this for me. I told Mr. Piecka that I had did everything that I could to settle this on my own. Mr. Piecka said that their lawyer know all of the tax laws and the tax professionals would be working for me, therefore I need not worry. Her we are 9 months later and I am out of $2830.00 with no resolutions and on top of that, they will not refund me not one penny of my money. Please what can I do.

I was audited by IRS back in 2007. I consulted JK Harris to take care of it on my behalf. They promised that they will start immediately contacting the IRS and get the information and I shouldn't worry. One week passed and nothing happened. I contacted the IRS audit officer to ask if anyone called on my case and he replied, "No, not at all. He told me also that I can do what they will do for me. The officer waived some of the penalty for me and advised me to get my money back from them ASAP before they start. I did contact them asking them to stop my case immediately and they did. I paid them $1400 the day they had me in their office for filling application. I requested the money back since they did absolutely nothing. A few months later, they send me a letter indicating that all they owe me is only $600 some. I was crazy and said why? Until today, more than 3 years and I’ve received nothing, not even the $$600 some they promised. I don't know what to do. Are we in USA or Nigeria! Can someone help me here? read more hide
I contracted with JK Harris in October 2010 to help settle some tax issues including a possible levy. They dropped the ball and did not file a tax return that the IRS was waiting for, and because of that, the IRS levied all the money in my bank accounts. JK Harris admitted that they did drop the ball and promised me a refund of the $3100.00 I paid them for this terrible service. I signed a release and was supposed to have my refund by the end of April! Now they won't take my calls or my emails. And of course no refund yet! I spoke with the Consumer Affairs Bureau in SC, where their Corporate Office is and I was told by them that there have been 132 complaints filed against them and they never answer the complaint. How do they get away with this? read more hide
Like most people, I have some tax issues. I reached out to JK Harris to help with this issue. I heard all this great advertising about how they help you with your tax problems, promising they will work with the IRS to solve them. They know all the laws. They are ex-IRS agents, so they can definitely help. Well, all they did was charge me $2500.00, filed some forms, and had me waiting and waiting. Then, they sent me a letter stating that my account was closed with the IRS. All I did was fill out an offer of compromise and send it to them. They did absolutely nothing but take my money. I could have filled out an offer in compromise on my own and sent it to the IRS. They claimed they could solve and get my IRS issues taken care of. I would like to file a class action suit against them. If you have any information for me, I would greatly appreciate it. I know there are other people out there that they ripped off. read more hide
JK Harris and Company had me sign a receipt and general release agreeing to pay me back money for service not rendered, but paid in advance. It's been over two years since services were prepaid and almost a year since the release was signed and returned. To me, as an average consumer, this is unacceptable behavior from a firm that deals with sensitive IRS cases. It was absolutely stressful and I was eventually hospitalized for the stress endured from them not paying back money that was rightfully mine in the first place. To JK Harris, the funds are petty change. To me, the funds are my families survival. The recruiter had no problem obtaining my funds via their main offices in Goose Creek, SC, but they ultimately refuse you the funds when they are obviously rightfully due to the consumer that paid them. read more hide
We paid JK Harris $5,000.00 to help us with the IRS. They did nothing but make our situation worse. They told us to make an offer and compromise. We did all the paperwork and waited and waited while penalties and interest piled up for about 2 years. Then they sent us a letter that said we would never be accepted by the IRS for a compromise because we have equity in your house! They knew this all along. We got lied to and it has caused us to become much deeper into debt to the IRS! We need our money back just to help pay our horrible IRS debt! read more hide
My story is a lot like most peoples issues that Ive read on this page. JK HARRIS is the worst company i have ever knew. They are definitely a scam going on here! I had at least 7 or 8 people that so called represented me , throughout the time ( 5 years ) I payed them thousands of dollars. JK HARRIS kept changing my contact person.Actually the first person I had representing me , I quote: be careful with this company they are not to be trusted , unquote. He shortly after that left JK HARRIS. I had to start with a new representative. There was a lack of communication on JK HARRIS side to me. When I called my representative, I didn't get a response, a lot . I was told be JK Harris that I was to communicate with the IRS, and the IRS said it was very unusual for this since JK HARRIS was representing me.I then had to go back to JK HARRIS and tell them what the IRS had said. This was very hard to do. I want to get my money back from JK HARRIS for horrible service and the way they represented my company and me.I definitely have a case and I want to file a law suit to JK HARRIS. read more hide
These so called "Tax Attorney" have scammed me. I've paid over $7,000.00 for them to help settle my tax debt with the IRS and all they have done is shuffle my account around from person to person for the past three years, in short, nothing has been accomplished or expedited. I received a call last week from them, stating that they could reactivate my account for a new discounted fee. This company should be shut down permanently and reimbursement should be paid back to all the people whom they have ripped off! read more hide
I found JK and Harris in the yellow pages and thought they would be a good company to go with. That I would qualify for an offer in compromise. Then I decided to do a background check on them the day after I found out my copies of the agreement papers were pretty much blank. I could not see or read anything. Then I started thinking why did he want me to fill out the paperwork that I didn't have any information about it and told me to guess how much everything was. And that he was in a big hurry for me to sign the money orders of $1,025 over to him because he had a flight to catch. I did a background check the day after and found out that they are scamming people all over the U.S. and cancelled them 2-3 days after I found all the information on them. read more hide
I got a bill from the IRS for $14,000.00 due to a sale of a home that was foreclosed. I panicked and went to JK Harris for help. They first told me to fill out this form that would give an estimated amount of what he thought I could settle for. He said they could help and "probably" settle with the IRS for about $300.00 plus their fees. I said "don't you need to know what the tax is for”? Is this a real tax or a mistake? He told me, no, they didn't need to know why the tax was there and that I had to pay it if the IRS said so. After paying almost a $300.00 payment a month (my husband and I were barely surviving as it was and went without to pay this to JK Harris), they came back and said you don't qualify. After several 1-hour drives to Knoxville, I called the main number and got an agent on the phone. She told me to fax her every bill and debt I had. I did this for 45 minutes and then I was told " Oh wait you do qualify, for an additional $2000.00 and we will file the settlement paper for you.” Not having any more money to spend, I was advised by a friend to go to a local CPA which I did. He looked at the tax paper by the IRS then asked me about how the tax was incurred and for $50.00 filed a paper to the IRS that this was not a legitimate tax due to the law imposed by Bush regarding foreclosures. The tax was removed by the IRS in 3 months. Now, tell me, for $1050.00, shouldn't these team of experts known that the first thing they should have done was to see if the tax was even legitimate? I filed a complaint with their department and they denied me because they did paper work. Excuse me; as far as I am concerned (and told them) none of the so called paperwork they did would have needed to be done if they would have known their job! I mean they are supposed to be the number one company in the US and supposed to have all these great CPA's and Ex IRS agents and attorneys working for them. Could no one pick up on the fact that I was being taxed on something I wasn't even supposed to pay? Please help me stop these people! read more hide
The way this company portrays themselves and the services they claim to provide is a scam. They are inefficient, basically useless and potentially extremely damaging to their clients. In my experience, they've done nothing I couldn't have done myself and appear to repeatedly be deliberately allowing time to pass so that a situation becomes critical before they act. Then they demand more fees at a time when you, the client, feel you have no choice but to pay to avoid some horrendous action by the IRS. I've sent numerous documents, statements, etc. only to have them tell me sometime later, after I call them, that the documents were illegible and I should need to send them again. This is nonsense as the documents are perfectly clear. I was charged $700 for them to make a call to the IRS to place a hold on collections. The amount was calculated from the amount owed and the urgency of the situation. The closer to the deadline, the more they can charge because of the clients fear. The call took 10 minutes. I had to be on the phone as well as the Harris rep. and could easily have done the whole thing myself for nothing. They prey on the fear of their clients and provide a service of little, if any, value. I am not dealing with the IRS directly and am very happy doing so. read more hide
I went through the whole initial consultation with JK, meeting in person and all that jazz. The next step according to the tax professional was to pay an extra amount of money up front before any sort of work can be done. If I hardly knew what my situation was, how could they require me to pay a huge amount of money before they even did a little research into my situation? Needless to say, this really put me off. I did not commit on the spot as I am very wary of financial companies I see advertised on TV. (previous experiences). So I decided to research any complaints from JK. If it wasn't for Consumer Affairs I would have probably gone through the same experience as everyone else here. The web is our greatest defense against scam companies. Now I still had to deal with my tax problem at hand and I know absolutely nothing of tax laws. So I went with a suggestion from a close friend that went through a similar situation. Their experience with the Tax Relief Foundation was a very good one. Now I know this is not the arena to boast about their performance (I will save that for some place for positive reviews). Needless to say my experience was exceptional! They also conduct a full tax investigation before they decide on an amount that's fair. I am just so happy that I caught these comments on JK before making a huge mistake. From now on I will always ask someone I trust for a recommendation, even if it's just to order pizza delivery for the night. read more hide
I contacted JK Harris because of an ad I saw for negotiation of pennies on dollar for back taxes to IRS. The total amount I owed was approximately $24,000 + $10,000 in interest and penalty. I had to pay JK Harris $300 upfront and then payments of $320 for 10 months, which was deducted automatically each month from checking account. Once I provided all my financial data to them, it was agreed that I had no disposable income left at the end of the month after living expenses. Several months after the balance to JK Harris was paid, they did the paperwork for IRS. First, the papers got lost; then, the totals were incorrect. The representative handling the case was changed several times, and there seemed to be mass confusion. Finally, after I received correspondence from IRS threatening to garnish my pay, JK Harris produced their resolution. The resolution was either an Offer in Compromise of $11,228.00 in cash or to pay $17,163 by making monthly installment payments of $712. Since I had no disposable income left, I was unable to accept either one of the terms. To avoid garnishment, my mother contacted IRS, and worked out a payment agreement with them of $300 a month in addition to claiming zero exemptions each payday. I could not afford even the $300 but my mother assists me in making the payments each month to try to finally get rid of this bill. We also discussed the Offer in Compromise (OIC) with IRS and they informed me that any individual can make the offer of 20% of total bill to be considered for an OIC. I feel that I was not appropriately represented by JK Harris. The outcome was certainly not what I expected and I feel that once they reviewed my financials, they knew exactly what they were able to do/or not do. $17,000 payable on a $35,000 bill is not really pennies on the dollar. I would like my money back from JK Harris because I don't feel that they did anything for me. read more hide
Short version: paid them 1,250.00 to help me with a tax problem, after I made the last payment on June 17, I got a letter from the IRS saying that Stephanie ** , John ** Samuel **, who I have never even knew , talked to, or anything else, would no longer be representing me! I have all the paperwork, receipts, and everything they asked me for (copiers) that letter was delivered to me on Oct. 17. I tried to call their office (during regular office hours) and got a machine telling me to call back during office hours. I am now out 1250.00 also I lost my job, and everything just keeps going downhill, my husband is losing hids job in Feb. and I still am fighting with the IRS over something I did not do. There is no extra money for anything. read more hide
We retained the services of JK Harris to help resolve out tax issues. The ads that are on the JK Harris website were promising and reassuring. Upon contacting a rep, the paperwork was quick and so was the money part. I paid JK Harris $1050.00 to do absolutely nothing! The service was okay at first with the rep stating "We will reduce your liability," "Nothing to worry about." 2 months later, there’s still no communication from this company. We called and requested an update from Carol the rep. She was forgetful and made excuses for the non communication from them. She said she would have the tax consultant contact us for a release so he could act on our behalf to the state. That transaction happened about a week later. 1 month later, we got no response as we are now getting threatening letter from the state to levy! I called and Carol just happened to get the results that day! How convenient! She stated, "We cannot help you. You have too much money. You have to pay the state everything." I know our income is not that great! My husband was on workman’s comp for 16 months with 2 knee surgeries! When I called to complain about my whole experience, it was like talking to a person that read a generic response! Their quality assurance division was a joke! I need further guidance to stop this company and hopefully see some of my fee retuned! Please help! What they did was nothing! I could have called the state of CA and had the same results but $1050.00 richer! read more hide
Tax Defense Network is no different than JK Harris or Tax Masters! I was originally ripped off by Tax Masters with a sales pitch that promised me an Offer in Compromise with no results and an upfront fee of 5 grand! Well guess what, I called JK Harris and got the same answer to my tax problems. I did not trust it for a second. So I kept looking for a reputable tax company. I called TDN and you know what? They told me the same thing as Tax Masters and JK Harris! 5 thousand dollars for an Offer in Compromise that I knew darn well I wasn't qualified for. Finally, I got help from Dave at US Tax Liberty. He didn't try to sell me, but told me exactly what was up and then told me they can't even quote a service fee until they contact the IRS and find out what can actually be done with my case. His number is **, if you still need help. There is a simple rule to find a good tax help company. If they try to sell you with a reduction right there on the first phone call with that fee right away, then stay away!

In October 2007, I received a notice from the IRS and IDR advising that I owed back taxes. Having seen JK Harris ad on TV, I contacted them and scheduled an appointment. Our contract was for them to file the back taxes and contact the IRS and IDR to schedule to negotiate a settlement. I was told to send them copies of any and everything that I received from IRS which I did. What I didn't know until a year later was that they were doing nothing with the papers I was sending them. When I pressed them for action as described in our contract, they cut off communication entirely. read more hide

Tax matter with the IRS. We hire JK Harris because with have tax problem according with JK Harris can give us a solution charge over 5,000.00. We paid a down payment and monthly payment by our bank account every month $308 dollars. Each time we call for update status with the IRS and we don't have any good answer, very poor orientation from them. Only solution we received was a letter from IRS for garnish and levy. We call JK Harris and the respond was no positive but still asking for monthly payment when we have call a lawyer and paid one thousand for get agreement with IRS for payment plan. We paid to the IRS 500.00 monthly and JK Harris send a statement every month to paid to them when that company do nothing for us. Before that company was another that keep our money and the California Court close the doors for fraud and we still waiting for a refund. Why the Government let those Company's ripoff the people. My story is too long, we need a Lawyer to suit JK Harris, we owe more because of the delay from them and Company doesn't care for the customer in trouble making money from the hard working people. read more hide
We hired JK Harris to settle our tax problem and we were assured that it would be taken care of. After over a year and after they took us for $3000.00, our claim was denied because of Sonya **** who was our caseworker. The IRS called us one day to get some information that I had already given to Sonya ****. The agent was very mad and said that she could not get the information on a timely manner. Sonya **** never followed up with us when she sent the proposal to the IRS to see if we could pay that. We got a letter from the IRS stating that they accepted the offer which was more than we could pay per month. Sonya never followed up on anything and I believe that they wanted to make an example out of JK Harris by refusing our offer. The time that IRS called us, I had to fax everything that they wanted and it cost me $45.00 to send which JK Harris should have done. I filed a complaint with BBB but to no avail. They still say that they have done what they were supposed to do. Needless to say, when Sonya messed up again with the IRS lady she was let go and another person took offer. By this time, it was too late. IRS has already made up their mind. I wish there was a class action suit in Florida. read more hide

I went to J.K. Harris office in Columbus, Ohio to get help dealing with an approx. 15K tax bill. Since I was not working at the time, the agent assured me I should file an offer in compromise at $0, and I would probably get my debt forgiven. Fool that I was, I paid the office $2500 to take the action. Months later, they sent me the offer in compromise to review, and just about everything except my name was wrong. They had totally wrong dates, account numbers, phone numbers, social security number, you name it. When I complained, they told me to "redo it with the correct info" and turn it in to the IRS. Needless to say, the IRS flatly turned the request down, and that was that. J.K. Harris was done. Period. They took $2500 from me simply to fill out one form incorrectly. Now I have received a letter from the IRS that J.K. Harris says they are no longer representing me. Like they ever did! They are con men, plain and simple. Crooks. How the government allows these charlatans to remain in business and out of jail is beyond me. read more hide
I hired J.K. Harris because I owed federal and state taxes for '06, '07, '08 and '09. The IRS was calling. I got very worried so I hired J.K. Harris. They told me they would review my tax problem, put a hold on the IRS calls and set up a resolution with the IRS. This is what happened. J.K. Harris takes your ability to pay. There is no set price. You have to provide (They give you a financial kit) and you have to list all your debts, everything! Then you have to bring proof of your debts with you to your next meeting, along with your pay slip. Then they make a determination on what it is going to cost to help you with your taxes. So it's really your ability to pay! For me that was $2700. I had to pay right then $300 just for them to get started (earnest money). Then you set up a payment plan (Post dated checks). Keep in mind, you have to take time off from work because in my case they only work during normal working hours and not the weekend. In the end, they did not find any errors on my taxes, did not help me in reducing any penalties and when it came to the resolution, they wanted me to send another debt report with my payslip again to tell the IRS what my ability to pay was. For me, that was going to be $420 a month. I did not agree to that. J.K. Harris told me that is how much it was going to be and there was nothing they could do about that. I called the IRS myself and I was told about two payment plans: one would get reported to the credit bureaus, the other would not. This was never explained to me by J.K. Harris. Also, the IRS asked me what I could afford to pay each month! I could not believe it. In about one hour on the phone, the IRS set me up with a payment plan of $250 a month. I called J.K. Harris back and told them about this and they had no comment. I asked for a $700 refund (Price of the resolution phase). They told me to contact their QA department. I wrote a letter explaining my situation. Two months later, they sent me a packet of forms to sign and they were only going to refund me $225. I wish I would have never ever got involved with J.K. Harris. They do not do what they promise and I believe they work for the IRS and not you! Please, whoever is reading this and considering J.K. Harris, do not hire them please. This is a very brief explanation of what I went through. J.K. Harris put me in a huge financial situation. I was scared hoping they could help me. I thought that they could get my penalties reduced and they told me they could. They did not. The payments to J.K. Harris made it hard for me to pay for food and gas just to get to work not to mention a dental payment that came up I could not pay because of the post dated checks to J.K. Harris. They cost me a ton of stress and disappointment, not to mention money! I could have used that money to pay towards the IRS. Unbelievable. The worst money I have ever spent. read more hide
This "firm" charged me to amend my taxes. The firm did it wrong and I was penalized. When I tried to call and get a new amendment, they refused to take my call. I called the 800 number to complain and they said that they would look into it but never did. They refused to forward my file with the tax documents to me. I filed a complaint with the BBB and they that they would look into it but finally just said that since the amendment was completed, I could not get my money back. read more hide
My wife and I are engineers and worked as independent contractors in the early 2000's for the electric company. We ended up losing our contracts at the same time and ended up having to live off our savings. My wife finally started working again several years after we relocated to California. To make a long story short, she starts being garnished and letters start coming in the mail that we owed $80,000 to the IRS! So we called up JK Harris after seeing a commercial. They did absolutely nothing! I'm serious. Other than require $600 per month for over two years from the both of us (thinking we we're getting an offer in compromise), we come to find out after continuing to be garnished and harassed by the IRS that they never even filed for any paperwork other than a Power of Attorney two years prior. JK Harris will string you along just to drain your bank account month after month! I finally got some help from US Tax Liberty; all I needed to do was file my returns for the past several years (we didn't file since the loss of our contracts, we didn't think we had to without an income) and then they set us up on an installment agreement for what we did owe from pulling out of our annuity without prepaying the taxes on it (only ended up owing 15 grand). Dave was our rep at US Tax Liberty and in hindsight, it was obvious not to use JK Harris by just comparing one conversation with Dave and one with that horrible guy from JK, who only told us what we wanted to hear so he could get our money. JK Harris is 100% the biggest scam you could ever be a part of. They will tell you they can perform miracles when it is really all lies! I'm telling you, if you go to them you will get ripped off! read more hide
My husband and I retained JK Harris in 2008 to assist us in a tax issue. After continued communication problems (they refused to answer our calls, return voice mails) and loss of important documentation, we terminated our contract with them and requested a refund. While some services were provided, we were offered reimbursement for a small portion of our pre-paid contract. We received this letter on May 20, 2010 and was told it was "processed" one month later. The letter clearly states we would receive our reimbursement check between 90-120 days (later told this only included business days). As of today, 120 days has passed. I just got off the phone with Quality Assurance (this was my fourth call in as many months) and was told the following, "QA has no hand in who, how or when a client received reimbursement. The accounting department issues a weekly list of whose check will be going out this week. We were not on the list and many clients have been waiting since 2009. I was not allowed to speak to accounting to find out the status of our check. There is absolutely no way to know when or even if it would arrive." Do not do business with JK Harris! Thus far, we are still waiting for $3,700 and could be for many years. Also, in the initial contract, it states (in legalese) as a client, you waive your right to retain a lawyer or engage in a lawsuit against JK Harris and the only recourse you have is through arbitration, which, as we found out, is virtually not an option. read more hide
I too have been expecting a refund from J.K. Harris in September of this year. I have submitted several emails and received several excuses why it hasn't happened.

I paid JK Harris $12,500 five years ago to resolve my tax problems which they said they could take care of. Up until now they have done nothing. They called the FBI and said I was harassing them and I should not be since they told the FBI in South Carolina that I got a full refund. This is not true. They have said I am not entitled to any refund because they tried to solve my tax problems. I do not believe them. The FBI was going to charge me with harassment, but they now have changed their mind since JK Harris lied to them. They are very mean and rude. Since JK Harris cannot or will not do anything or refund my money, I now still have even more tax problems, liens, garnishments, etc. I also lost my $12,500 to JK Harris, which I could really use now to help me eat and pay rent since I still cannot work much. read more hide

After we signed contract, we paid total $2700 in time. However, JK Harris' case worker worked with us for a year, then things changed after she no longer working at JK Harris. First of all, nobody ever called us about this change. The last word we heard from that case worker was everything should be all set, just waiting from IRS which might take for a while. We finally called to find out the case worker changed. The case worker was very rude and treated us like a criminal. She said, she called us but we never received any calls. The said asked for the last 3 months bank statements which we gave to her after a couple of days requesting from bank. Never heard from her again. Then when we called, she said our case was closed. What a scam! We are very hurt by this situation. We feel that they are only interested in the payment we gave to them, not willing to spend effort. Now, they told us that we have to open the new case, sign new contract and the sales person called us right away asking for a new contract. What a joke: the case worker never get hold of us. But sales got hold of us right away.We want JK Harris to evaluate the case **and give us a fair treatment. We want to have the contract re-open.

I contacted JK Harris. A personal interview was conducted, I furnished all needed information and as we started to make payments, JK Harris dropped us. The IRS, when contacted, stated from Charleston, SC office that JK Harris agency never requested my file from IRS. We are still trying to deal with the IRS, which is a one-way street if anyone else has tried to negotiate and use common sense. JK Harris never responded to calls, emails, letters, faxes, etc. This is pitiful public relations. I feel it is because I am one small case, low profile, low attention getting case. I hope others can deal with them or we all force them to confess negligence. The claim is from when my wife withdrew funds from IRS to pay for her mother's funeral and many bills (which she is not legally responsible). The IRA company did not take out taxes for IRS. I claim that the IRS is due only taxes on this IRA, no the IRS re-figured our combined total income at a later year.

I hired JK Harris almost three years ago to help negotiate a settlement with the IRS. They deducted $2,500.00 out of checking account until my contract was paid in full. I provided all documentation, statements, everything they requested to submit to IRS. I finally received a letter from IRS that my Power of Attorney (JK Harris) did not participate in a mandatory conference on my behalf so they denied my offer of settlement. When I called my account representative, Sherry **, in the South Carolina office, I asked her about the letter. I was told they don't participate in conferences. Then what did I pay them for? I then asked Sherry** who I could talk to about requesting a refund and she placed me on hold or mute. I could hear her clearly saying to another JK Harris employee, "Some people think they are so special. Get a grip." After she got back on the phone with me, I confronted her about what I heard and of course she denied it. Apparently I was special enough to debit $2,500.00 out of my checking account. I to this day have not heard back from Sherry Black's supervisor and after reading all the other inquiries, I'm not surprised. I've reported JK Harris along with Miss. Sunshine Sherry ** to the Texas Attorney General's Office, the Better Business Bureau of Gooseneck, SC as well as the BBB in Austin, Texas. Every time I see a JK Harris commercial on TV here in Austin, I'm going to call the TV station. I don't understand how they can still be in business. read more hide
I hired JK Harris Tax Company to represent us and negotiate a settlement for pay roll taxes. I was not informed of what was happening. I had to call. I had different caseworkers they never returned calls, were rude and uncaring. I paid 500 for 10 months, they never resolved anything .When I pressured them, I was told that I could pay 2000 dollars a month until I finished paying. I was told that they could lower taxes as I would not have to pay penalties. Not so, I still have an unresolved issue and am out 5000 dollars don't be taken in by these **. read more hide
I went to JK Harris after receiving several certified mailings from the IRS for back tax returns. As is the case, I was terrified. I had been laid off from my job, on unemployment, unable to pay my existing bills, etc. After several hours, mountains of paperwork, Powers-of-Attorney, I was told that it would cost me approximately $3,000 with a down payment which I made. I was promised that the letters would no longer come to my house and they would get me a "do not attempt to collect" status until I found a job. Months and months later, with no communication from anyone at JK Harris unless, I initiated the call. The only thing I received from them were monthly billings which I did not pay and have not paid. The certified letters continued and finally after over a year of constant harassment, I received the "do not attempt to collect," however, we have filed a lien letter. I no longer receive mail from IRS, but I am furious that it took so long and that no communication came from their office to me to update. When I called them, I would find that I had a new person in charge of my case and they were not familiar with what was going on. There was no team. The only good thing about all this is that I have paid them very little and do not intend to pay them anymore regardless of the contract. They did not do what they said they would do and I lived with the nightmare until they did. Sorry, JK Harris, I would never recommend you to anyone for any reason! Psychological for a year or so my life was a living hell. Financially, I do not know yet and I still can't find work and will not pay JKH when I do. read more hide
I got them to do my taxes & dropped them. I called and they sent me a letter stating I was granted a partial refund of $1,545 after I have paid them $2,100. I signed a receipt & General Release, they said it would take 90-120 days before I got anything. Now look I still don't have my money and that was February 2009. I have called numerous times and no one will return my calls. What kind of business are they running? They take people's money and run with it. I want what's mine. I am stressed out about them not giving me my money back. read more hide
I have been a client of theirs for over 4 years and I have had numerous case workers handling my case. Of all there was only one that took all of two days to solve my case. Bridgette I believe is her name. I have paid them and had a problem but still ended up paying you as agreed. Since that time I have become disabled. I don't want sympathy, I just want you to hear this. At the end when it was most crucial, no one from JK Harris handled the IRS. I was told that I was to speak to them so what did I pay you guys for? Then they told me to ignore the rejection of offer and compromise and when I hear from the IRS again to call you back. Then I was told my case is closed because they didn't accept my offer. I thought you were supposed to take it to the end. I even told the worker I would be willing to try to make reasonable payments and I was transferred to the sales department. I feel like a fool. I don't think it is just unsatisfied customers. They make promises that they don't keep, they hire inexperienced workers, and they don't advise people properly. Half of these young people I am sure never worked for the IRS. I depended on them and told people good things about their company. I asked for support and asked questions, but their people are more closed mouth than the IRS! Well, no more. Now I have a lien on my home, getting ready to levy my SSDI checked again, and other personal problems that I would love to tell you but I am sure that you don't care. I made a mistake and have been trying to fix it with your help but you really let me down! read more hide
I hired J K Harris to represent me with the IRS, paid them $3500 to help fix a problem, now they have created an even bigger problem than when we started. One of the employers Erica admitted to making a mistake on August 26, 2010 at 9:00 am. They sent paperwork for another compromise and nothing was updated, they just sent anything to shut us up. We let a lawyer look at the paperwork and he laughed and said what a joke. We are so unhappy with J K Harris, I would never recommend them to anyone and I would like at least half a refund of the $3500 I paid them. The corporate Gina ** never returned any of our 5 phone messages we left. They never return any phone calls at the office. It is sad that I have to pay to re-open my compromise because of the neglect of J K Harris. having to take time out from work to try and contact people to try and fix the mistakes made by J K Harris, and having to come up with more money to re-open my case. I was making all my payments monthly. I’m worried because nobody would return my calls to let me know anything about my case. read more hide
This nightmare with J.K. Harris was over a year and a half ago. We needed to clear up our taxes. I saw their commercial and called for an appointment. Signed all of the forms and releases it took them forever to get anything back to us. Mostly due to the fact someone had lost our file. Every time I sent paper they asked for they would send me a letter that the file could not be completed because they did not have the papers I had sent to them. This was a constant routine with them. I would send papers to them and they would send me a letter stating that they need the same papers that they had just requested only to find out that they did not get them. I would call and never get a call back. Trying to email was just as bad. At one point with State Taxes, the person I was told the cases had been handed told me that she had no idea what I was talking about and that I had to deal with State myself. I called the gentleman who was working on our taxes. After 6 weeks I finally reaching him, he said, the reason he had not done them was he did not have a S.S.I After I picked my chin up off the floor, I, gave him the S.S. I number. Several weeks later the IRS papers that he sent were still wrong. They did not have any of my husband’s W2's. I called him to let him know that they were wrong and left a message. Three weeks later I called again, He said, (not to worry about it, just file them and they would file an amendment). I told him I will not send them in that way I wanted them done correct. That took a few more months. The worst problem was the State Taxes. Eight months we have been trying to get them to CA. We lived in CA. in 2004, moved to AZ in 2005, 2006, 2007, and WA in 2008. When they filed the State, they filed them all for the State of CA. Sense then CA has garnished my husband’s wages for taxes that we don't even owe. I called the case worker she would not take my call. After a week I spoke to someone else she was somewhat rude. Then I asked if I had signed the revised form for them to do the different states. I think that she was hopeful that we had not. Come to find out we had. So now I am waiting for them to review our file to see what happened so they may be able to fix the problem of the garnishing of the check. At one point with State Taxes, the person I was told the cases had been handed to someone else told me that she had no idea what I was talking about and that I had to deal with State myself. This has been the worst experience I have ever had in my life. The customer service was horrible. There, business practices are questionable at best. We paid them over $11,000 and still have nothing settled. read more hide
After 3 years and over $15,000 paid to J.K. Harris, my wife and I are forced to deal with the IRS on our own. Three years ago, we were told by a J.K. Harris representative that they could settle our $48,000 plus tax debt with the IRS. All of a sudden, we were recently told that the debt is less than the amount of our income and that they could not help us. This is the same debt and income that we had 3 years ago. Had they told us this from the beginning, we could have paid to the IRS already the $15,000 towards our debt. J.K. Harris and companies like these are all scam artists. Our tax debt is still there and we are out of $15,000. My advice, try to deal with the IRS yourselves. We are now forced to deal with the IRS ourselves in order of reaching a payment arrangement. We have received letters on their "intent to levy". We do not own any real property. But they could levy our income if we cannot reach a reasonable payment arrangement. read more hide
I had a liability to pay a fine on Income tax. I went to see them with the first letter. They claimed that I needed a thorough tax review done. I paid $1200.00. Documentation was sent to me. I contacted them when I received the documentation which was at the same time I got the bill from the IRS. The tax review that was so necessary to get things started was never discussed with me. Rather they started their scare tactics on what the IRS was going to demand and how much it was going to cost me in addition to what I already paid. Do not use these types of tax services. They are scams. I called the IRS and worked it out with them. They were very understanding and agreed on an amount that I had offered. read more hide
My husband had 5 years of back tax debt. He saw the ad on TV for JK Harris and thought it was the way to go. He was scared and nervous, he thought they could help. $6,000.00 and 1 year later, the issue is still not resolved. Every time I call, I am told a different story and the customer service reps are very rude, no compassion or empathy for my husband and I. They are argumentative and instantly on the defense. I have said to them, you must get a lot of calls from unhappy clients because of the way you are instantly defensive, bold and loud on the phone. My husband and I were told we wouldn't have to worry, they could make a deal with the state and federal government so we wouldn't have to pay penalties or interest. It didn't happen. They didn't even tell us that they had our returns done until I called and asked what was going on. Then they said, "oh, they're finished now and we will mail them to you". They only mailed some of the returns (state). I had to call and fight with them on the phone just to get the federal returns. My husband and I have wasted $6,000 on nothing but lies and deceit. That money could have went to our back taxes. So now, we are at the point where only some of the state returns were completed and they are trying to say we were not contracted for 2003 state, only federal return. Come on, why would we do only the federal returns and not the state? I am very upset. I feel that this is a scam. We were lied to and treated very poorly. They are misrepresenting what they can do. They are nice when you first walk in and when you are paying them but after you have paid all you owed, you're lucky if you hear from them again. I definitely do not recommend using this company's services. They shouldn't be allowed to prey on innocent citizens who are just trying to set things right with uncle Sam. My husband and I are humiliated and exhausted and now, we have to pay even more to get our '03 state return done. I have lost sleep many nights over this and I am depressed even more today than I ever was. read more hide
I contacted JK Harris to help me to settle my back taxes and paid the fee that they had asked. I received very little contact from them and now I have had a lien placed by the IRS, but all the time I thought that JK Harris and Company was working to prevent that from happening, and the money I had paid to JK Harris I could have paid towards my taxes. I feel that they are out for themselves and take advantage of people’s mishaps. I never should have put my trust in them, but they make their TV commercials seem so innocent that they can help you, but they don't. How can a company continue to operate like they do? I’ve had more problems with the IRS, and lost money for the fee that JK Harris charge and the stress afterwards after you find out that they did not do what you have paid them to do. I hope there’s some way that I could be refunded the money I lost with them and that someone closes this company down before they cause more hardship to people who trust them for their services that they do not deliver. Thank you. read more hide
Tyrone ****, my JK Harris representative was a smooth talker. He assured me that they would be able to cut my IRS debt down substantially by obtaining an 'OIC' (mine is offer in compromise) from the IRS. Upon the 1st meeting, I was told I needed to make 3 payments of $250 to get the JK Harris lawyers in motion collecting my information and establishing a case for me. From what I've read, I was lucky it was not a larger amount! After calling me into the office, two more times to get additional information and signatures, I was told that the JK Harris lawyers recommended a payment plan. When I protested, they said they would continue to fight for my cause and I never heard back. It's obviously a well-oiled corruption machine out for money any way they can get it. The more gullible the client, the more they stand to make. I wish I had done more research and taken care of things myself. Visiting JK Harris for help simply added $750 to my $11,000 IRS debt. Not to mention the time it took to meet with them, gather the required paperwork and the stress of waiting and frustration. read more hide
In September of 2008, I walked into a JK Harris office scared and confused about my back tax situation. After seeing the advertisement from JK Harris about how much they could help someone like me with the tax problems I was having. I put my trust in them to help me. Being Tax specialists as they claim I went ahead and listened to all the things they said they could and would do for me. Then after signing a contract worth over 6000.00 dollars it started. The constant things that( I ) had to do, not JK HARRIS, I did a lot if not most of the information gathering and when I tried to get some help from them I was treated poorly and told that is what I had to do and they could not help me. So after a year or so I was presented with the fact that they indeed could not remove any of the interest or penalties from my state taxes which is not what I was told at the start of these proceedings. So I had to settle for a payment plan for 99 months. Then the fed tax issue became just that an issue, after going back and forth with JK Harris and changing people that were handling my case at least 3 times they got me to the OIC and of course it was rejected. When I asked them about why the penalties and interest where not removed like they said they could and would do. There was a pause in the conversation and then they had no good explanation why that did not happen. At this point, I asked the JK Harris rep, "What the next move was?" and she told me that I needed to sign another contract for them to continue with my case, When asked what have you done for me for the six thousand I already gave you? They said and I quote " we got you to the offer OIC". So in closing, I just want to say that they did nothing for me. I could not have done myself for the money I gave them. They misrepresented themselves about what they could do for me and I truly believe they should be held accountable for the people like me who are trying to do the right thing in getting these matters taken care of but are not sure or even know nothing about tax laws and programs that are available. I am not a very educated man so being able to read and truly understand the contracts that they provide is almost impossible and I believe they know that and take advantage of this. I am very upset and disappointed with JK Harris and am not sure what to do or who to turn to. So if any one knows who or how to handle this matter please feel free to contact me so we can put a stop to people like JK HARRIS taking advantage of the average person that works hard for there money and is truly trying to do the right thing by being a productive tax paying member of our society. read more hide
On May 4th 2010, in Jackson Mississippi, I signed a contract for with JK Harris to assist me with settling back taxes with the Iraq. From May 4th until June 23rd, I was contacted by Angela J. to complete a form 8821. I had no further contact with anyone from JK Harris until June 23. At which time I e-mailed Angela ***. I have all email traffic. Anglea J. responded with, "Your Professional Staff Recommendation Report was completed and sent to your Consultant on June 4th." I was told I would receive a phone call from my consultant. As I am still serving in Iraq and there is an 8-hour time difference. I waited patiently by my phone for 8 hours on the 23rd ( all night) and on the 24th and had no contact from JK Harris at all. On the 25th, I asked for my money back as I have received no communications other than my contact with Angela. I was told by Angela that someone would be in contact with me over my request . In mid July, I had not received any communications from JK Harris. I contacted my bank and filed a dispute over the charges. That money was refunded to my account. Several days after I was refunded my money, I received notice from the IRS that I was identified as a tax delinquent and had a certain number of days to render payment. As I am still in Iraq, no action can be filed against me by the IRS. JK Harris is the only one that could have made any allegations or notified the IRS of my situation as JK Harris is the only entity other than myself that is aware of my tax situation. On August 12th, I received at my home in Richland, Mississippi a packet of information from JK Harris outlining what actions I should take with the IRS. This is the first communication I have had with JK harris concerning my case since May 4TH. The same packet of information was mailed to the bank investigator, who promptly made the decision to send JK Harris back the funds I had disputed. I made every attempt to point out that I had not been provided with any services from JK Harris. I even provided an example to the investigator. I pointed out it was like paying for a hamburger. The hamburger is prepared but I never got the hamburger. Even with this, the investigator had an IQ of 2 minus plant life and could not understand the concept. JK Harris notified the IRS that I was tax delinquent. I am serving in Iraq and am exempted from paying my taxes until I return home. I have been charged $1350 by JK HARRIS and have received nothing. I entered into contract with JK Harris on May the 4th. I had no communication or contact from JK Harris until August 10th. The added stress and worry over my taxes being here in a combat environment caused me many sleepless nights. It has affected my work and my personal relationship with my wife and children and my health. These people took my money like any common thief would read more hide
I ran into tax issues for the 2009 tax year. After spending $1500.00 for J. K. services, I received no results. They did not perform any services and I was asked to pay them more to set up a repayment plan to the IRS. With the money that I gave them, I could have used it to pay off part of my debt. I wish I had looked into it more. They put on a good front but in reality they don't do anything they advertise. I did not get any reductions at all! That didn't stop them from collecting me money. I will be paying to the IRS for the next 15 years. Thanks for your service. You did nothing for me and it makes me wonder if your company didn't pay for the so called testimonials. read more hide
Well I called in about a tax problem I had, and as soon as I explained my tax hardship, I was asked for 2250 as a down payment for the service. But the total fee was around $6700 for a back tax owed of $40k, federal and state together. They told me that I can get an offer and I was feeling good about it, but I also told them that I did get a letter from the IRS that I was getting garnished and it was coming within a week or so. Now when I signed up with them, it was 02-13-2010. I was garnished on 3-01-2010. I did send them the letter right after I got it in the mail and they said they would take care of it. So I thought that everything was okay. but when I got my check and my employer told me that they had to garnish my wages because of IRS issues, I was then really **. They said they would handle it. I never got a call when I left a message. I sent an email. I did everything to get them to pick up. So nothing went well in my favor. Now I get $900 taken from my pay every month. So I just gave up, and I came across a firm that I tried one more time, I didn't want to do another program because of these people. So I gave them a chance and they actually stop the garnishment, resolved the tax issue and I got a refund of the money they took from me. So I can't say that it didn't work out for the best. So if anyone would like to get the help I got, then let me know and I can find the number for you. read more hide
After being homeless for a number of years, I did not have any money at all to purchase a stamp. I was not in a position to be able to file my taxes. Since I was recently able to move into the Y and get a viable job with income, I went to JK Harris to find out what they could do for me. I advised Matthew **, the representative, that I did not have the money he requested and could not confirm their services. Then two weeks later, I received a letter from the IRS which was later followed up with a levy against my income. It made me so mad that I ever met with him. I was not trying to avoid my taxes, but I needed time to file the six years in order to get the right amount I owed. Now I am looking for the lawyers who won the 54 million dollar lawsuit against JK Harris so they can help me. I am at risk of losing my job because of this levy which was just given to me on August 2, 2010. read more hide

I owed $35,000 back to the IRS. So when I saw the commercial for JK Harris I thought I would give them a call and see if they could help me. Do not trust this company. They immediately wanted me to charge $4,500 on my credit card so they could work on my case. $4,500! After a 20 minutes conversation. That put a bad taste in my mouth. So I started doing some research on how you can reduce your tax debt. It turns out that most of what JK Harris told me they could do for me didn't even apply to my specific case. read more hide
I contacted JK Harris in 2009 to help me reduce my tax debt. I didn’t file for 2000-2004. Apparently, the IRS will file for you if you don’t. So the IRS told me I owed 20k in back taxes and had started garnishing my pay. At JK Harris, they told me, based on my hardship and financial situation, that I was qualified for an offer in compromise and would only have to pay the IRS $1,000. Lies! I paid them $2,200 up front so they could file a power of attorney and stop the garnishment and $1,200 a month for the next 3 months would be my total fees for the POA and the OIC. The garnishments stopped for 3 months. I called in to see why and they told me my OIC was rejected and there was nothing they could do for me. Then, they told me that I was not entitled to a refund because there is no guarantee for the outcome and the money I paid them was for their services, which they performed! They did nothing for me and took $5,800 from me! About 6 months ago, after searching for some sort of solution to my taxes, I came across settlewiththeirs.info. According to them, OIC is not even a legitimate way to reduce your tax debt unless the IRS determines that you have no way of repaying the debt, i.e., on your death bed with no job or assets. But they did a tax investigation for free and got back to me with the results the next day. It turns out that I was not entitled to an OIC like they stated earlier, but they said they could reduce most of the interest and penalties on my debt and stop the garnishment indefinitely. I have 12 months left of $250 a month back to the IRS, and then I will be done with this tax debt forever! And they were about 2 grand less than JK Harris. Moral of the story: if it sounds too good to be true, then it is! Stay away from JK Harris. I am filling a complaint to the attorney general, the BBB and my governor! I suggest that you all do the same! read more hide
I used JK Harris Service and was totally *** about the service that I got from them. I'm still going through the process of getting my money back from these bloodsuckers but I did find someone to help me. I went to ** and they helped me out. I got a settlement offer with the IRS and I had a debt of $32000 and saved around 25k of the total debt. So I'm happy, and also they never asked for any fees up front before they did some work for me. So go there and see what they can do for you. read more hide
I had a Tax issue and it was both Federal and State. I owed around 50k in back taxes. So I contacted JK Harris because I did see them on TV and I thought that since they were on TV, they would be a prime choice for me and I can get this taken care of. Lo and behold, that was really the beginning of my nightmare. They asked me for all kinds of fees up front before they fully understood my situation. The agent told me that I didn't need to worry any longer because they have a good reputation in this industry and that the IRS always gives them the best offers for the clients in his firm. So I paid 450 dollars up front and that was what he called an initial fee for the Tax Investigation to fully see what the IRS was looking for. So from there, he gave me a fee. When he called me back and said that they could get this resolved for an additional fee of 7200 dollars and that I could pay all of that up front or do installment payments. Well, I also told him that I got letters from the IRS stating that my wages will be garnished and also they were looking to audit me also, so it was a nightmare. He did assure me that I will be protected. So I paid a down payment of 2250 dollars for them to get started and protect me. First of all, I want to say that, I wasn't protected. I was garnished for 32% of my wages and also they put a hold on my account, a hold on my son's savings account that I've been paying into for the past 8 years and that was frozen. So when I told JK Harris that, he said that they couldn't do nothing as of yet because the IRS already started the process but they can contact the IRS and negotiate and get them to return my funds and release the hold on my accounts. That never happened. So when I asked them to just stop whatever they are doing because I should be able to contact the IRS and get something done myself. I asked for my money back and he told me that since they started working on my case that I couldn't get my money back. And I told him that if I don't get my money back that there will be a big problem. So I'm contacting the BBB, the Attorney General, FTC and anyone else that I have to. I wouldn't recommend them to anyone I know or don't know. read more hide
We had sales tax issues and met with a representative in the Melville office. He assured me that JK Harris would be able to help me eliminate my debt. I made payments of $2,000 in order to hire them. They were of no help to me. and I called and wrote to them that I didn't want to continue with them. I wasn't happy with their work. They mailed a letter for me to sign that they would refund $1,500 of the $2,000 payment I made. I signed the release form, which stated that my refund would be issued withing 30-90 days. That was 2 years ago. To this day, I am waiting for my refund. I call and email, and they give me the run around. They tell me they have no news of when I will get my refund. I don't know what to do, and feel like I have been robbed. I have been taken advantage of. They took $2,000, I didn't get good service and they won't send my refund. read more hide

I contacted JK Harris in 2007 after seeing one of their commercials. Let me start by saying that I blame no one else other than myself for putting myself in the situation that I am in. With that said, I contacted JK Harris because I had a substantial amount of back due taxes owed to the IRS. In the first meeting with their rep I was told that based on the information I provided, they felt I would qualify for an OIC (Offer in Compromise), meaning that they (JK Harris) would make an offer of less than what I owed to the IRS on my behalf. I was told "Not to make any payments until the case was settled because if I made even one payment then that would make it more difficult for JK Harris to get me the OIC!" To make a long story short, after 2 1/2 years, 3 different case managers at JK Harris and two different lawyers at JK Harris, I was told that the IRS rejected my OIC. I could never get in touch with any of my case managers. There were times where my calls went unreturned for weeks and weeks. So in addition to what I originally owed, I accumulated thousands of dollars in penalties and interest that was piled on to what I originally owed. Additionally, I paid JK Harris almost $3,000 to handle my case. read more hide

At JK Harris, they told me based on my hardship and financial situation, I was qualified for an Offer In Compromise and would only have to pay the IRS for $1,000. Lies! I paid them $2,200 upfront so they could file a Power of Attorney and stop the garnishment and $1,200 a month for the next 3 months would be my total fees for the POA and the OIC. The garnishments stopped for 3 months. I called in to see why and they told me my OIC was rejected and there was nothing they could do for me. Then they told me that I was not entitled to a refund because there is no guarantee for the outcome and the money I paid them was for their services which they performed! Complete **! They did nothing for me and took $5,800 from me! About 6 months ago, after searching for some sort of solution to my taxes, I came across SettleWithTheirs. According to them, OIC is not even a legitimate way to reduce your tax debt unless the IRS determines that you have no way of repaying the debt (i.e., on your death bed with no job or assets). But they did a tax investigation for free and got back to me with the results the next day. It turns out that I was not entitled to an OIC like they stated earlier, but they said they could reduce most of the interest and penalties on my debt and stop the garnishment indefinitely. I have 12 months left of $250 a month back to the IRS, then I will be done with this tax debt forever! They were about 2 grand less than JK Harris. Moral of the story: If it sounds too good to be true, then it is! Stay away from JK Harris. I'm filing a complaint to the attorney general, the BBB and my governor! I suggest that you all do the same! read more hide
I acquired the services of JK Harris Co., because I had a problem with the IRS. This was in the year 1995. I never got any help and when I asked for my refund of $1500, I was told that they were still working on my case. read more hide
I am like all the rest of the people I hired JKH to resolve a tax problem for me. I was told that they will do away with the tax or reduce the amount that the IRS said I owed. Like many others that I have read, I have been through at least 3 to 4 persons that I was working with .One was fired the very hour that I called in to talk to her. They very rarely call to tell you what is going on with your account and when you do get through to somebody, they give you the run around. I believe that this guy by the name Mr. I is a make up name not a real person. He is the power of attorney. I have paid them a total of $2500. and have not got a thing out of them. The offer and comp has been rejected and they want to stop. I think a class action suit is to be brought against them for misrepresentation. I could go on with my complaint. Just do not use JKH. They do nothing but take your money. read more hide
I hired JK Harris to resolve a possible tax issue and I paid them a retainer of $1550. It was later determined that the tax issue resolved itself and their services were not needed. We agreed to a partial refund of my retainer ($975). I filled out all necessary paperwork, nine months ago, to have JK Harris release my funds and I have sent no less than 25 e-mails couple with over a dozen phone calls. Although approved to receive my refund, I have yet to receive my check. I have a letter sent to the CEO as well as several other executives and Case Specialists. For several months, I have sought my refund for $975 (the remainder of the retainer). I signed the release forms in September 2009 and was informed that my refund would be sent in 90-120 days. After not receiving my refund within the time frame the company specified, I contacted both Review and Oversight Department as well as the Quality Assurance Department. They informed me that my refund could take up to 120 business days. So, I waited until the end of 120 business days (February 2010) but still, there was no refund. I have sent several additional emails, as well as, made several phone calls requesting my refund. Regardless of the form of communication, the reply was standard and without resolution: "We are issuing refund checks as quickly as possible and apologize for the delay. We will contact you directly as soon as we have an exact issue date. Please feel free to send an email or call." Most recently, on several occasions, I've requested a supervisor's contact information. Here's how the Quality Assurance Department replied: "There is not an individual supervisor that handles the refunds." As a fellow executive, I would be most concerned how the Quality Assurance Department handles customer related issues - especially without supervision. I think you would agree that, at this point, I am getting the runaround. I have accumulated 15 pages of email correspondence that aptly documents the inordinate amount of hours I've dedicated trying to have JK Harris issue my refund check. It has been eight months since my initial request. Please advise how JK Harris intends to resolve this issue. I had countless hours of time communicating with JK Harris as well as immeasurable stress. I am currently under financial strain and need my money to apply towards other financial obligations.
JK Harris submitted a compromise to the IRS for back taxes I fell behind in. They submitted the OIC, knowing the IRS would not accept the offer because I was and still am unemployed. When I told them they needed to refund my $2,000 because of the deception, they stated that they did all the paperwork and their contract was finished. The lady I spoke with at the IRS stated to me that 98% of the OIC's submitted by JK Harris are turned down. Good track record. I was turned down again in reference to my refund from JK Harris. I would and do tell everyone I know not to do business with JK Harris. After paying JK Harris all that money, I still had to pay the full amount owed to the IRS and made payment arrangements. I just threw $2,000 away to JK Harris.
On April 10, 2007, I consulted with JK Harris and Co. in reference to a problem that I was having with the IRS. I thought I had back federal and state income taxes that were due from prior years. I was informed that I had to file all taxes for all years that I had not filed, which were tax years 02, 03, 04, 05, 06 and 07. After filing all outstanding taxes that I had not filed, I began to get refund checks from the IRS. I could not understand way. Finally, I telephone the representative that was handling my case (Michael **) to find out why I was getting the refunds when I owed back taxes. Michael informed me that I did not owe any back taxes. I then telephoned the IRS a find out that the taxes that I thought I owed was discharged in 1995 and 1996. I then went to the Circuit Court of Baltimore City to pick up the copy of the release information. I then telephoned Michael to find out what happen to the payment of $4,800.00 that I had paid to JK Harris and Co. I was informed that several documents had been filed with IRS at a cost of $2,208.00 and I was entitled to a refund in the amount of $2,592.00. On July 19, 2009, I received a Receipt and General Release form to sign and return to them. The letter stated, "once we receive the signed release, it will be forwarded to our accounting department for processing". We will process your signed General Release in the order in which it is received, and this process could take between 90-120 days. As of today, June 26, 2010, I have not received the refund check. Almost a year later, I have sent several emails to the company and the only response that I get is "we are processing refunds as fast as possible, we will email you when your refund check is ready". I cannot understand why JK Harris had to charge me $2,208.00 when the IRS had discharged my case in 1995 and 1996 and I did not hire them until 2007. What took them so long to find out I did not owe the money. I feel that I am being ignored in reference to my refund check that it is almost a year later, I still have not gotten any results. I only had 1 week to pay the $4,800.00, why does it take this long to process a refund check. I am in the process of purchasing a home and I could use this money to help with the closing cost. This has been a frustrating situation for me. Looking for your response. I have all paperwork if needed.
There were numerous people that I discussed our tax issues with. After paying approx $13,000 and approx 3 years of correspondence with JK Harris, there never was a resolution. It was impossible to get JK Harris to put into writing to me the steps that they took to resolve our IRS tax obligation. We were told we would only have to pay $500 in taxes to the IRS. Incorrect, the IRS rejected our paperwork. JK Harris washed their hands of this, refusing to return calls or taking this matter to another level.
I paid a large sum of money to get help negotiating with IRS. They did nothing and would not even return my call or emails. Stay far away from these people. Request was sent too late to IRS and several thousand dollars lost.
I contacted JK Harris to help me and guide me on how to resolve my back tax issues. I explained to the JK Harris my situation. I haven't filed or paid taxes in over 7 years and wanted to resolve any issue to catch up on my taxes. I paid $1,220.00 for my taxes to be done, which I could have done my self for a lot less. Then paid another $920.00, to be told that I had to pay the amount due, including any penalties. Then, I was asked to pay another $1,300 to negotiate a payment plan. I decided to deal directly with the IRS and it seems as though, I could have just dealt directly with them and not have wasted so much money. I have never felt so taken advantage of as much as I feel right now. $2,140 dollars which could have gone to my taxes. I am now stuck with over $82,000 that most of it are penalties. IRS was not knocking at my door. but I thought the right thing to do is catch up on my IRS so I would have piece of mind. With all the knowledge your company claims to have, you would think at my initial request for help. The advise would have been "Mr **, we feel that with your case you would be better off dealing directly with the IRS". I was presented with false hope and will do my best to make sure that this never happens to anyone else.
Hired JK Harris on approx October/ November 2008 for back taxes deposit for $2000.00 and withdrawn from my account $440.00 mo for a year on the first of each mo not a day late and I didn't give them the ok to with drawl it that way. But I let it go thinking they were working on my taxes around November 2009 I received a wage garnishment come to find out they did not even file a paper with the IRS how can this company who was sued by 18 states in 2005 but yet it's 2010 and they cont to do the same business as before taking money from people and not doing the work. I can't believe there is not a government agency that would protect the us people from criminals like this I have saved every document including all emails I sent them for the last year please if you could help I have seen a web site with multi complaints consumer complaints. I have left information with an attorney regarding a second class action law suit I feel this company should not be allowed to cont to advertise on TV. And continue to take people’s money I have been offered a settlement back in February by JK Harris. I have tried for 2 months to talk with anyone regarding the refund no one will. Return my call leaving several message and email for 2 mo including today several times please help.
Well, I contacted JK Harris to help with my tax debt in which I explained to my representative that the IRS was going to levy me in two days if I did not complete my paperwork to them. He told me not to worry. But when someone tells me not to worry, I worry. So two days later, I called JK Harris representative and he did not answer. I immediately called my bank to put a stop payment on my check (caught it just in time) and contacted the IRS, filed out the paperwork and negotiated a settlement and a penalty abatement program myself. These companies are a fraud. If I would have listened and followed what JK Harris said, I would have been levied and my wages would have been garnished. Now I am happy and through with the IRS.
I've got some tax problems from the past several years back. I went to JK Harris for them to help me with my tax problems. They assured me that they could take care of it. I was just reading some comments about them on a site and I was in shock because it's exactly what is happening to me too! I have changed case specialists at least 3 times now, filed all my paperwork 4 times, getting ready for a 4th time now. The paperwork is for my bank account statements, monthly bills, etc. They tell me everything's a go, then I say great, but at the same time, I'm getting letters from the IRS. So, I called them and told them. They said, don't worry, I was under non-collectible status, meaning, they wont levy my wages! Well that's where I'm at now, they are levying my wages now and they are avoiding my calls, trying to talk in circles. Well, I sure would like to shut these people down, oh and by the way, I paid JK Harris in full. Now, I owe even more money this year for interest and penalties over $20,000.00. I could really use some help from someone. I'm at a loss on what to do. I owe much more money now.
I have been having my payment out my bank account. My offer got rejected due to the information that JK Harris already had. Then I found out when the NC state IRS sent me a letter to start drafting it out of my paycheck then i had to notify JK Harris and it happened 6 months ago and never contacted me. I don't want to pay what I don't owe, but I will pay what I do owe. They switched case specialist 3 times in 5 months and only one called to let me know what was going on.
I contacted JK Harris to resolve an outstanding tax debt from 2007 and from 2008. They were quick to take my $4200 and assured me they would likely settle my debt for about $1700 then they became useless. After they filed the paperwork, I saw that they did not include 2007 on the settlement offer. I pointed it out and was told, "Oh, it won't really matter anyway." I couldn't believe it. They only amended the offer when I complained loud enough. Finally, I ended up paying the total tax for 2007 (over $20,000). I re-figured it myself and paid it. Then they (JK Harris) told me I hadn't paid it all and they would settle the remaining balance. I actually had the letter from IRS indicating it was paid! They were faxed a copy! They did my 2008 state tax and did not include a tax court ruling regarding attorney fees. This would cause my tax to be $9500. When I pointed it out, they said they did not know what I was talking about and that my tax was $9500. I based my own calculation on current tax law and the tax was $4200. The State accepted it and credited me with having paid my tax in full. I could not believe the incompetence. When I told them what I did, the person (the 7th or 8th I dealt with) was very nasty to me and basically called me a liar. At this point, the only thing still outstanding was my 2008 tax. The original tax was $49000. At JK Harris' direction, I sent in an offer of $9670. The IRS sent back a reply and said I had to pay $52,000. When I called JK Harris and talked to my case specialist, another new one, she had me fax her the paper. Then she told me that it looked about right and there wouldn't be much I could do to dispute the amounts listed by the OIC case officer. I couldn't believe my ears! When I pointed out that my original tax was $49000 and that I had given them $4200 and now my tax was more than my original tax, and that by hiring JK Harris I had actually lost $7,000 due to their incompetence, she reminded me that I always had the option of dealing with IRS myself. I would hasten to point to anyone that I felt like I had been dealing with IRS myself! JK Harris had done nothing. I actually had to recheck everything they did and caught several mistakes which would have cost me thousands more. All in all, I spoke to a total of 14 people, had five case specialists assigned to my case without notice of any change, all in about a 15 month period. And I did all my own paperwork. JK Harris filed the extension form for me. Everything else they sent to me and told me to fill it out and send it in. I could have done that without their $4200 worth of guidance. They are useless. If you really need tax help in a big way, hire an individual accountant or tax attorney, not a "Tax debt settlement" firm of any kind. I have paid out a little over $7000 more than I would have if I had just paid the tax straight out in the first place. Only by my own diligence did I detect and correct their lazy incompetence and avoid losing an additional $5000+. I really wasn't able to pay the tax initially or I would have. I went to JK Harris looking for relief. I went through 15 months of hell from the IRS. I actually experienced physical symptoms from the stress including weight loss, headaches, increased LDL Cholesterol, and digestive problems that required medication from my doctor. I am still being treated for physical symptoms of stress and I don't mean little things. I was in for more testing this morning. I kept telling myself it would be OK in the end. Now I find out that I will actually be in debt to the IRS for more than my original tax. This is what the JK Harris team has done for me. I hope you have better luck than I did.
After you very clearly understand what J.K. Harris and Company will actually do on your behalf and what their advertisements and staff imply they will do, and then decide to use their services, be very, very careful that you fully understand the Terms and Conditions on the "Engagement Agreements" you will be asked to sign or initial. You will likely to be asked to sign more than one document. Do not assume that the Terms and Conditions on both are identical; they may well not be. You may suffer consequences because you thought they were both the same since they seem to "look" the same.
It has been a couple years now since I have been dealing with JK Harris to get my tax issue resolved. I paid $2,500 to have an installment agreement and after waiting tirelessly to have anything done and with threats from the IRS I decided to do the negotiation myself. The amount that the IRS wanted was more than I could afford so I called JK Harris and told them the situation. I then decided that an offer in compromise might be better than installments so I told them I want to do an offer in compromise. I have been waiting for months after months and nothing gets done. Have been through several case specialist and each new case specialist knows nothing about the case. It takes so long for them to do anything that by the time they send you a bunch a forms to sign, the information is outdated. There is now a lien on my wife's property. JK needs to be put out business. I have nothing good to say about this company.
They took my $500. They did nothing. I signed a review and oversight refund for $375. It was approved and I was promised a refund in 120 days on 3 September 2009. No response to date. Mr. ** said it might be years to get my refund.
I was told to pay $2,550 up front by Walter ** who represents JK Harris in the Midland ,Texas Area. He Is from New Mexico & JK Harris would get my taxes lowered by IRS. I was then contacted by Latoya ** in Goose Creek SC who said a consultant would contact me. This never happened. Now I owe my Son $2,550 and still have problems with IRS.
I meet with their representative, told him my tax problems. He said would easy that that's what they do. I set up auto pay, throw my bank {I made all the payments} sent them tax information. Talk to comp. counselor, was then reassigned to different counselor a couple later, weeks later yet another counselor. I received a letter requesting more information after send what they request then I was given the run around when I would call. I paid in good faith and got nothing, I still have my tax problem and my bank account is a little lighter. I did try to call them and find out what happened after yet another half run around and being put on hold 4 times. I was told that they would review my case and respond with in 48 hour that was 2 weeks ago this is a scam from start to finish. Any help would be thankful. I am going through a divorce. I was looking to them for resolve, they misguided me. I feel robbed and taken advantage of.
J.K. Harris and Company evidenced that anyone thinking of using this firm should approach them very, very carefully, and should be completely certain that they clearly understand what services will be provided. They should not be mislead or confused by inferences in advertising statements or those that are made by J.K.Harris personnel inferring what the firm will do. J.K. Harris and Company has failed to refund payment which they agreed I am entitled. Further, in calculating the amount, the cited conditions in their contract that were not present, and made (intended?) errors in simple calculations.
JK.Harris took $3500.00 of our money and did nothing for it. They sat on our case for a year and when the IRS started levying our accounts, it took a week just to get a hold of the woman working with us. We could not make our house payments or pay our bill. This situation forced us into bankruptcy. We almost lost our home and the credit is shot. I could go on but whats the point? We just want our $3500.00 back.
I contracted JK Harris on April 22, 2009 to resolve my back taxes problem with the IRS and the State of California. By mid-May, the company had reached a settlement with the IRS and had the levies against my bank accounts lifted. The resolution of my State of California tax problem has been a nightmare. JK Harris started working on my case in the end of May 2009, and there still has been no resolution as of April 2010. In July 2009, a JK Harris agent called me to resolve my IRS problem. I informed the agent that that was a done deal and I need to get the state resolved. 9 months later, I'm now getting threatening letters from the state tax board, and they are demanding immediate payment. Since May 2009, I have had 3 different case specialists. The latest one came on the heels of a reorganization that was designed to improve customer satisfaction. I am far from satisfied. I have faxed the same financial info over and over. It seems the communication from specialist to specialist is far from seamless. I never missed a JK Harris payment. Unhappy with the service, I tried to reach a supervisor. I tried to contact the supervisor for over a week, left messages, and never received a return phone call. When I called last Friday, I was put in the que and had to listen to mindless commercials on relieving my tax-related stress. I was disconnected 3 times in a row. Since I could not reach a supervisor, they end up putting me through to the same specialist whom I was trying to log a complaint against. I reached my boil-over point when she asked me to sign another power of attorney form for the IRS. I explained that an agreement with the IRS was reached last May and that I'm getting threats from the state demanding immediate settlement. I asked her to focus on the state issue versus trying to cover ground of a year ago. I also pointed out that since JK Harris did the IRS settlement, she might want to read the company records to verify. She stated that her records showed no such activity and that JK Harris must contact the IRS to ensure an agreement was reached. I asked if my bank statements for the past 4 months showing IRS payment were not enough proof, but she stated she must confirm the deal herself. I told her since I had less than one week to avoid another levy on my account, I wished JK Harris would work on the state problem. Worried about the letters I received from the state, I went home and contacted the state tax board. I explained my issue with JK Harris and also stated that I really wanted to resolve my tax problem. The state tax advisor asked what I could afford and the basic financial questions. In the same call, I had the settlement I had been asking JK Harris to negotiate for me for almost a year. I would never recommend this firm to anyone. I am asking for a refund on the state money I have paid out to date. Reading the letters posted on your site, I guess I will not be holding my breath for the refund.
The fall of 2007, I met up with a rep for JK Harris and signed the "contract" for their services. As nothing was happening, I was in touch with the IRS and got that mess straightened out. JK Harris didn't do a thing except take my monthly payment for "nothing". So I asked for a refund and it went through a process for months then I received a letter stating my refund was approved. Minus the 25% of it for them I would get my refund in 6 months. Working days no weekends or holidays, so I should have had the refund of $1816 around April of 2009. It's April of 2010, still nothing except excuses. The customer service people say they are working on it as quick as they can and I will be notified when the check has been issued. I call every week for an update and it’s the same song and dance and I'm beyond peeved! They say the same script and I am so tired of it! That's pretty sad when you’re given such a hard time and they went against their contract to boot. I want interest on the money. I know, right!
I paid them $5,000 to help me with offer and compromise with IRS. They also was to help me prevent liens and levies against me. They did not as a levy was presented against my payroll acct. and lasted a month. Finally, they said the IRS wanted a payment of $844 by December. They never did anything for me. I could not pay any creditors during this time. I still am paying a huge payment to state in federal each month with penalties and interest. I am going to have to file bankruptcy as I can. I am 71 and single and drawing SS and trying to workout and pay my creditors and this tax debt.
I contracted JK Harris to do an offer in compromise. It took them over a year basically to even start the compromise. I had to keep calling to even get them to start it. I talked to a new person each time. They did not inform me that if I owed the government the following year, the offer would be void. Major flaw in communication. I then asked them to start over, including the new year taxes owed since I was not told that this would affect the offer. They told me the contract was over and they could not help me further. What a waste of money, I'm 34 and still owe the government a ton of money. I thought this would help but all they did was hurt me more..
I paid JK Harris to represent me with the IRS and paid $4,000, and the first offer to IRS was rejected. I did an appeal, and the second offer was rejected. I found out from the IRS that JK Harris did not forward the package of information to the IRS. I was lied to. JK Harris said the IRS turned the offer down because did not change from last offer. I overnighted a package to JK Harris, and they said they would forward it to the IRS. They did not! I am out $4,000, and they wasted my time and money. And most of all, they lied!
I contracted JKHarris to help me with my IRS issue in 2008. Only to realize it is still dragging out now in 2010. I have gone threw 3 case workers only to have mis communication and no communication at all. I continue to call and call and fax in writing and call only to realize that they breach our contract. And when I called, I speak to a different person each time. I had paid my payment up until the last payment only to realize that I'm paying them to do nothing. I had to go to the IRS Building in Richmond Va, to speak with them because I was still getting letters saying they were going to put liens on my truck and garnish my wages. I'm paying JKHarris to do something and they are taking my money. I was given a tax advocate from the IRS and I had to revoke my JKHarris Power of attorney on my case which was Mr. S. I called him twice only to get no response. I then called back to ask why do I have to pay the last payment when JKHarris did nothing and now I have a tax advocate. My tax advocate said there were big communication gaps in my case and I also had to send paperwork to the IRS because JKHarris wasn't. I faxed letters to the complaint dept only to get no response. Now I have Plaza associates calling to collect the last payment for JKHarris and no one will contact me from JKHarris about my case. I have had the worst experience with this company and would never recommend it to anyone. I am still trying to deal with JKHarris about breaching the contract. I have been so stressed out and continuing to get headaches because of them. I am giving them to the end of March 2010 to get back with me about this matter. If not, I will have to go to a legal matter.
In 2002 I met with an agent who told me they could settle my $10,000.00 debt for $3,000.00. I paid them that amount plus interest. Months went by and I gave them a call. I was told to contact the IRS, but I paid them to represent me.
As a result of a tax issue and after seeing the numerous ads on TV, my wife and I called and set up an appointment and met with a JKH rep. on 1-16-2008. $8,000 later and we had no results. They lied. We've sent in the requested paperwork and have paid approximately $8,000 and they haven't done anything to help us. But one thing they can do is harass us for payment! We even paid extra for them to get their emergency team to work on our case asap and stop my wife's wage garnishment. That, too, was a bald face lie. After reviewing the class action lawsuit info online, it is quiet evident that JKH's mode of operation is to "string you along", until they've received their money and do absolutely nothing for the "customer". Time and time again, state after state, customer after customer, the story is all the same. They should be stopped cold in their tracks! Please, allow us to be part of a class action lawsuit in Alabama. Perhaps if JKH is hit hard enough, each and every time they mistreat some trusting individual, they will either clean-up their act or go out of business. They have cost us $8,000 approximately and have not done anything to help us resolve our tax issue. Please help us.
We requested a refund on Nov. 9, 2009 of $1650. We met with a company representative named Mr. Chase L. on Oct. 1, 2009 in a company office in Ocala, FL seeking help resolving a lien on my credit report dating from 1992. He advised my wife and I that they would take care of our problem and requested a deposit for $750 and additional deposit of $900 for JK Harris Advisors. We made it clear we did not need tax planning as our income is minimal since we are retired and living on Social Security. However, he insisted we needed both deposits to remedy this situation. As of six months later, the only correspondence had been cookie cutter tax planning form. We have not received and contact from JK Harris concerning our tax problem. Why are these people still allowed to operate? Can you help us to get some kind of refund from this company? The internet message boards are full of similar complaints.
I hired JK Harris to help me with an IRS problem. I had and believed they were helping me, or at least, they told me in every phone call that they took care of the problem. It got to a point I almost got arrested. No one ever called the IRS on my behalf and even talked to the IRS. It cost me over 10,000 dollars to hire lawyers and CPAs to help me who also heard horror stories. Never hire this company. They lie, lie, lie. The psychological damage I suffered, the worrying, and the fact the U S government allows them to ** people and false advertising amazes me.
We have been with JK Harris since December 2006. We paid them $13,000. My husband had a real tax mess, then we got audited. Now the IRS wants us to pay $1051.00 monthly. I called JK Harris. They really aren't doing anything, we can't pay this monthly payment to the IRS. We are a small business and have financial issues like the rest of the world. We lost about 80% of our business, I have the papers to prove it. I heard all kinds of bad things about JK Harris, never having a bad experience with them, probably because we were suckers and paid them all this money. I remember when we were getting audited, we met with someone from JK Harris. He told my husband and I that he would have to charge us $6000 for the audit. Well, I cried and blubbered so much that he reduced the price to $3000. We had to put so much down, then they would take payments monthly out of our checking account. Sounds fishy, huh? I should have known then. We are just so desperate to settle this with the IRS and trusted JK Harris. I can still hear the guy saying to us "we can fix this for you". Well, it has been 2 years and $13,000 later, my husband's back taxes are done but we still don't have a settlement with the IRS. I don't know what we are going to do next! I am scared and I don't know who to trust anymore. I wish someone had the power to stop companies like JK Harris. I will tell everyone I know and I will badmouth them to everyone that I can.
I saw their commercials about helping people deal with their tax problems so I contacted them. I was connected to South Carolina with Kathie ** who will be my representative but I did not know that I was dealing with a con artist. The company took $500 from me and I never heard from them again. Finally, after calling and leaving messages upon messages, Kathie contacted me and said that if I want to pursue the matter, it is going to cost me more. So that was the end of my money.
I met with a representative from J.K.Harris, named Chris **. I told him that I owed back taxes, and was looking to settle. He did the math on his calculator and showed me his figures. He said it looks like we are looking at an offer and compromise. He said for $1500, J.K.Harris could get the IRS to settle for $1200 to $4000. I asked, then would it be settled? He said yes as long as you keep current with your future taxes. If not I will still owe everything. I said "great, lets do it." He had me sign some contracts. I did, but after that sham of a company took my money, all they did was to release my work levy. I called and asked when they would do the offer and compromise, and was told that they never said they would settle. I even called Chris ** and he denied ever telling me those figures. I said well how did I know those figures then? He said I must have been told that by another person I spoke to on the phone. He was such a liar! I could not believe he was such a scammer. They never settled and the IRS still came after me. I wrote the oversight department asking for a refund, but was denied. Do not use .J.K Harris! They are a bunch of crooks!
In desperation, my husband and I went to JK Harris (JKH). Their ad says you get to meet face to face with a real human being. Ha, what a joke. Yes, that human being is a super used car salesman type who tells you if you sign the contract with JK Harris, all your troubles will disappear, because they are experts and can handle everything... for a large fee. You become so relieved to hear that someone can "fix" it; you fall for their line. We were vulnerable, and they count on that. They prey on scared, vulnerable people. After the initial meeting, there is nothing but changing staff, having to explain your situation every time you speak to the new "personal" case worker, only that person is different every time you have a question. I am not sure whether they go through personnel, because people see their dishonesty and quit, or what. So after weeks and weeks of frustration at not getting any answers and doing all their bogus paper work, we still had no one actually negotiating anything on our behalf with the IRS. They had our six thousand dollars and a huge amount of our time taken up with their "busy work," but nothing regarding the IRS. We kept getting the letters from the IRS and calling JKH over and over. No one would return calls, and even if they did, they had no answers. And in the meantime, the IRS just kept on coming at us. Finally, I got so exasperated, fearing the worst was about to happen, that I called the IRS myself. I was connected to an agent who listened to my story over the phone and gave me a list of things to do: get my cars appraised, fill out a form he was going to send me, make copies of a few items, and send it all to him. I did what he asked in one day and sent it to him the next day, and I waited. After about two weeks, he sent me a letter telling me what to pay. Simple. From a forty three thousand tax debt down to six thousand dollars. No wasted time. No garnishing. No threats. And no fees. Just the amount of tax he determined I needed to pay. Most definitely, a settlement down to a fraction of what we owed. In this tax climate, I can't say that the collectors would do it now, but honestly, dealing with them was much easier than dealing with JKH. Plus, the same man called me each time, and I had a direct phone number to him. I once told him that I was so tired of all of the tax mess and worrying about it and worrying about what I had paid JKH for nothing, and that for all I care, they could come arrest me for tax fraud if they wanted to, because I needed a paid vacation. The IRS guy laughed and said, "Not paying your back taxes was not considered tax fraud, and the government did not want to give me a vacation." All in all, as fearsome and intimidating as the IRS can be, dealing with this agent was a thousand times better than JKH. In the end, we paid both of them the same amount. We could have saved our selves six thousand if we had just gone to the IRS first. Of course, when we tried to get our money back, because we actually settled directly with the IRS, they just played the "contract" card. No one who is in tax trouble has the money to go after them legally, hiring lawyers and taking them to court for not upholding their end of the bargain. So JKH gets away with it. If we had that kind of money, we would just pay our taxes and be done with it. I think they count on that, and that's how they stay in business. However, we were told by our accountant that if we filed a small claim against them in small claims court and that more than likely, no one would show up to represent them, the judge would then automatically rule for us. For those of you who would like to try that, it might be worth the effort. JKH is a scam company, preying upon scared, broke, and vulnerable people. They should be shut down. With an "F" with the BBB, I can't figure out why they are still in business, unless folks like us don't do our homework.
I paid JK Harris over three thousand dollars for a tax relief to help me settle my problem with the IRS. At the time, the IRS was going to put a levy on my pay check and JK Harris said they would get it off and they didn't. Then I paid them more money because they said for six thousand dollars, they could do an offer and compromise to the IRS. So, I paid them and they never even did that. So I call them to get a refund on the services not rendered and no one is getting back to me. I have been swindled. Will someone please call me on my cell phone and talk to me? Thank you. It ruined me financially and set me back even further on my taxes when I was trying to do the right thing and now I trust absolutely no one.
They did nothing on my account but collect money, and then after 6 months of doing nothing, the Revenue Agents showed up at my home and business. These people are worthless. Heavy collections, not good.
I paid J. K. Harris over $3,000 to take care of my tax problems. They changed the people who were working on my case every 3 months or so. I would receive letters from the IRS and I could call J. K. Harris and they would have me fax the letters to them. When I asked them if they were supposed to receive the letters, they would tell me not all the time. I even received a call from one of their agents and she left a number for me to call. When I returned the call, I was called a liar by one of the operators there and was told that I in fact did not receive a phone call from that particular agent. Finally, two months ago the IRS put a levy on my bank account. I called J. K. Harris and advised them what had happened. They told me it would be at least a week before their tax representative would get an answer from the IRS. I then went to the IRS and they lifted the levy within 45 minutes. Of course, I had to sign a re-payment agreement. I then fired J. K. Harris and requested a full refund, which after several weeks they refused. With J. K. Harris's help, I now owe the IRS over $63,000.00. I will be dead before it is ever paid for and it still won't be paid for then! It cost me $3,000 to hire J. K. Harris and I now owe the IRS over $63,000.00.
My new husband and I met with Debbie ** from JK Harris at the end of September 2009 to see if they could negotiate my husband's tax debt with the IRS or help us otherwise come up with a payment plan. He owed just under $10,000 from before we were married. She told us that they negotiate all the time with the IRS and they could help us with this amount. I specifically asked her about the amount, because no other company we saw advertised would talk to us because the tax debt wasn't over $10,000. She told us to stop making payments to the IRS, and they would take care of everything. We signed a contract and agreed to make 3 payments of $250, totaling $750. We did not hear from her for a month. I repeatedly tried to call her, I left messages, and there's no return phone call. I received a call on 11/03/09 in which I asked her how the negotiations was coming. She told me that they were not finished and we would have to wait. Our first deduction came out on 10/16/09, the second on 10/26/09, and the final payment on 11/09/09. Still we received no return phone calls. My husband, who was no longer making payments to the IRS, received a tax levy notification in his paycheck on 11/12/09. The IRS would be taking about 75% of his paycheck until the debt was paid starting 11/19/09. I made an emergency call to Debbie to see what kind of progress JK Harris had made. She informed me that we did not qualify for a compromise with the IRS, and she emailed me the report. She said if we wanted to spend another $1800, they would get the IRS to remove the tax levy. I told her that I certainly wouldn't be spending any more money with a company that promised us they could help us and then could not. I also told her right then that we wanted our money back. She told me that there would be no refund whatsoever. When I looked at the report, it was dated 10/14/09! They knew they wouldn't be able to help us before they ever took a cent from us! Then they waited until all 3 payments were made before telling us that there was nothing they could do. Because we were waiting on JK Harris and because we stopped making payments to the IRS based on the advice of JK Harris, now the IRS is garnishing 75% of my husband's wages. I disputed the charges with my bank, but because we signed a contract they will not reverse the charges. Their refund policy in the contract is completely worthless, because you have to request the refund before they finish the work. Debbie ** lied when she said the report was not finished, and I doubt they would have returned our money anyway considering the deceitful way JK Harris does business.
I entered into a contract with them to resolve a tax debt. They required me to pay a $2300 retainer, which I paid. After some time went by and I researched the OIC, I realized that the fee was too high and requested a refund as our contract said I could do. JK Harris is doing everything possible to delay payment. I am probably going to have to sue them. I have filed complaints with the BBB, and they have given unsatisfactory responses. I noticed they are also rated with an F by the BBB.
I hired JK Harris & Co. in August 2009 to represent me in my attempt to have IRS penalties abated. In reviewing my case, I was told by Mr. ** that I had a legitimate reason for requesting the abatement and that JK Harris has represented others with similar cases with favorable results. I paid over $800 to have JK Harris represent me in my request of the IRS. After four months of repeated calls to Mr. ** to inquire as to the status of my case, he never returned any calls, nor did I receive any copies of any documentation prepared or submitted to the IRS in my behalf. In other words, I have no idea what work was done or not done to resolve my case, nor what correspondence was sent to the IRS. In December 2009, I received a letter from the IRS explaining that there are only four reasons for which the IRS will reverse penalties. My case clearly did not fall under one of the four reasons. My complaint against JK Harris is that as Tax Resolution Specialists, they should have been aware of the IRS rules for abating penalties, and they should have identified the fact that my case did not qualify. However, they proceeded to charge me for a service knowing there would not be favorable results.
Flame on! I got laid off from Hewlett Packard after 28 years of service and got one year salary payment into my 401k (which I didn't know that at the time). Without a job since October 2005, I've been using my 401k to live on. Knowing that the IRS taxes 50% on early withdrawal of 401k (I was 50 at the time), I went to JK Harris in Atlanta and signed a contract for $6,000 for them to work out something with the IRS. An Offer in Compromise was discussed and that felt like the best for me. To make a long story short, I went through everything others said sending JKH paperwork and back tax returns from past years. JKH did nothing. I now owe the IRS $91,000, have nothing left in my 401k, have a lien on my credit report and the IRS took every cent out of my checking account. On my own, I have submitted and Offer in Compromise with the IRS and demanded a refund from JKH. I have also contacted the Attorney General in Georgia and Illinois where I know reside and submitted a consumer complaint. Hopefully, I get my money back so I can use that for the Offer in Compromise with the IRS. JKH is a scammer and the CEO should be put in jail for scamming the public, mail fraud and anything else we can pin on them! Flame off.
We lost our house in 2005. Instead of foreclosure, we signed our house back over to the bank. They said if we agreed to be out by a certain date and left all appliances we could walk away. We did that. In 2008 we started getting billed from the IRS. They are stating we had unreported income(the difference for what we owed and what the house sold for), and now with penalities and fines we owe federal almost 15,000. State just contacted us in the past 2 weeks, same thing, we owe 5,000. I was sick to my stomach thinking how can we lose everything and now they want us to pay more. They were threatening the usual, and I was so stressed I couldn't sleep and late night seen what I thought was the answer to my prayers. JK Harris-I called they arranged a meeting with me, the agent said oh don't worry about any of this, you didn't recieve any monies so you wouldn't owe any. The problem is it will cost you about $2300. But if you agree to pay us that we will take your case and you will owe no more than $500. and I am sure not even that. I was so relieved I was sobbing. We signed the paper and agreed to monthly payments. A year later we find out that we now have a payment plan with the IRS for the full amount and more fines and penalties to come on the federal starting in Jan of 2010. Basically, we still owe what we started with and more in fines and penalties and we owe JK Harris 2300.00 on top of that. I try to talk to them about what exactly did they do for us and they don't say anything except you signed the paper. You owe us the money. They never return our calls I have to track them down, and when you do get someone on the phone, it's only to find out that I now have another new agent. I have had 5 different agents that I know of and none of them have ever contacted me. I thought I hired people who have my best interest at heart. I was instead completely scammed. I am going to stop payment with them and let the chips fall where they may. I have nothing left.
after 3500 dollors they were going to solve my tax problem. after 5 years later i solved it by chapter 7. i hired a lawer to solve it. i never herd from them after they took my money. i want my money back plus there crooks
I paid J.K. Harris to help me with my tax problems. On my initial visit to them I was told that with my income and with what I owed, I would only need to pay the IRS $500. Now 3 years later and several Power of Attorneys and Case Specialist, they have dropped me as a client with no warning. The way I found out was that the IRS sent me a letter stating that J.K. Harris is no longer representing me. Meaning that I'm on my own. I owe more to the IRS now, then I did when I started. Also, I did most of the work myself. If I wanted to know anything, I was the one that called J.K. Harris, or e-mailed them for an update. I would never have known that another new Case Specialist or Power of Attorney was taking over my case, if I didn't take the initiative to call them. They took my money and did nothing to help me solve this. Now I'm own my own and I can't afford to have my wages garnished. I feel that J.K. Harris should refund me and also pay for my penalty and interest fees that have added up over the years. Over the three years, the IRS has liens on me, levied my bank account. Physically, I am on more anti-depressant medications, I can't sleep, and econmically my credit is terrible.
I hired JKH. We kept contact, but the young lady in the Chas., SC office was hesitating. Finally, we stopped contact as the agency (JKH) told us they could do nothing as the IRS was to foreclose. I contacted the IRS in Florence through the NJ office and their version was JKH never filled out the form to disclose our Tax information. as of 11-16-09 $240/ month until ever withdrawn from my pension.
I hired JK Harris to help me with my tax debt. They said they could help, so I paid them $1400 up front and$370 a month for 12 months. $1200 of this money was for them prparing 4 years of taxes returns, which they nevere did. I spent $5800, they never stiopped any garnishment, or levy on my bank accounts. All I did was fill out & work on more and more paper work. They do not keep track of your account,s o they have no idea what the IRS is about to do to you. They take your money and give you nothing in return, but more greif. I would like a refund of the funds spent, so that I can apply it to my tax debt, ASAP.
We contacted JK Harris after seeing their T.V. commercial. We owe several thousand dollars in back taxes after a medical situation caused us to loose our business. We needed help with an Offer In Compromise and they said absolutely, they cold help. We paid over $2500 (total charges were to be $5000) but as nothing was getting done, I held off payment of balance. First our representative was new and filed the wrong power of attorney. Then she was fired and the next person, did the same thing. After several months with no action whatsoever we requested our money back. I spent more time on the phone with them than I did with the IRS. In July 2009, we were promised a partial refund (less than half) in 90 to 120 days. Today (Nov. 17th, 2009, I got a return call (I have been calling for a while to see where the money was) and was told that the refund wouldn't be here till maybe sometime in December 2009, but she couldn't promise me anything. I have hired someone else to do the job they promised to do and I really need that money to pay him. We are on a fixed income and it is not enough to exist. I have a chance to open a new business but I cannot until the old tax issue is resolved. I stress to JK Harris that time was important, we will loose what little we have left (we lost our home and business in the previous situation) if we cannot earn additional income soon. They promised that it wouldn't be a problem. It's been 14 months and we are no further along than we were at the beginning.
i owe 16,000 on back taxes. i hired jk harris and paid them 2000. they have done nothing for me. i now have a lein and a levy against my properties. they have done absolutly nothing except give me excuses. no matter what i say they try to blame me for not doing my part. which was all done in a timely manner on ny part. they failed to get the documentation in on time. what did i pay them for? i have all documentation that was sent to them and when. all i have done for my 2000 is fight them

I am new in Durham, having moved here from Danville, VA 11/1/2008. My tax documents were misplaced in the move and I was unable to file on time, so I requested an extension from the IRS and sent them my check for $3,000 on 4/14/09. I did not know whether I owed state income tax to Virginia or NC, so I was dependent on whoever I found to do my taxes to tell me how to resolve that problem. I went to H&R Block first; the tax accountant took my personal papers, and said she would call me as soon as my return was ready. She did not call me and never responded to my frequent calls and visits to their office. I was finally able to contact someone else from H&R Block who said my accountant was sick and after much persuasion on my part, they found my papers in one of their pending files and returned them to me. I found J.K. Harris on the internet and they scheduled me for an appointment. Their office was in a very impressive-looking building, but I learned during the interview they were just renting a small space there, the agent seemed very nice - but new to the firm. He wanted copies of my documents rather than the originals and didn't have access to a copy machine, so asked me to have copies made and bring them back to him. He was only there one day a week, so this involved a lot of time. I realize I was very naive, but felt very pressured by that time to get my taxes filed. By then I only had until 10/15/09 to get them in. I made contact with him one more time and then couldn't get in touch with him for several weeks. I spoke to him on the phone and he said he'd gotten married and been transferred to another location and that Chaka N would be taking care of me in Durham. When I contacted N, and asked to go in and pick up my papers, he agreed on a general time. When I got there, he kept me waiting for a long time and his manager finally talked to me in the lobby. N finally came to the lobby and the had "found" my papers which were "lost", and said they had to have full payment of $200.00 in advance. I paid them, signed their contract and left. The whole thing was a comedy of errors and I should have seen through the scam as it was taking place, but all I could think of at the time was getting my taxes filed. The two young men involved - L and N - thought they were going to be trained to be CPA's, but their manager was more transparent.
I hired them to help me with a levy the IRS put on my bank accounts and they did nothing to help me, I paid the IRS and signed a Release form for JK Harris, giving them $800 for doing nothing more than filling out a form and sending it to the IRS. I was told I would receive a refund within 90 to 120 days, I signed the Release on March 13, 2009. I have not received the refund, they keep telling me they will give me my refund but I have no confidence they will.
I was audited by the Federal IRS for some retirement benefits that were not appropriately reported (in K$) and they were charging me penalties and interest for over 100K, so I contacted J. K. Harris and Company to help me figure out why the IRS was questioning my return for 2007. I talked to a receptionist and she followed through by sending my call to one, called, Lance A. He sent me some papers and asked to contract their services to help me with IRS questions and resolve my audit. He took funds (250.00) from my bank account. I never heard back from him after he identified himself as one of their consutlants and reassured me that he would be there for me every step of the way. Well he was not and since I have an organized system and have always reported my annual returns, I did the work myself and contacted the IRS, who by the way, was willing to work with me. Lance did not do an ounce of work for me but charged me for his service that I never received. When I contacted him this week, he was defensive and told me my audit was complete but during all the time that I was corresponding with the IRS, he never contacted me by mail, email, nor snail mail. Like if he had never existed. He never did anything for me. I want for Lance Allen of J. K. Harris to reimburse me all the money he took from my bank account in full. He DID NOTHING for me. I did all the work and he has the audacity to tell me he fixed my audit. He is a high paid liar. Lance has caused me sleepless nights, stress, anxiety, nausea, headaches, and to top it off, REGRET that I ever contacted J. K. Harris and Lance. He sent me a nasty email where he wanted me to just ignore requesting my money back. He has his nerve after he didn't not diddly squat for me. This contact with J. K. Harris is a complete SCAM and they are taking consumers for a free ride to their bank coffers. I resent that and I refuse to do further business with them, except find some excellent legal help to regain my funds and sanity back.
I met with representive for consultation on my past taxes. Before I had time to think he was having me sign papers to withdraw payements from my account. I told him I had insuffient funds and asked that the withdraw be held for 7 days. He agreed. The following day after reading paper work I called tim F and asked that he cancel everything. He said he would. 1 working day later I found a withdrawal from my account. I immediately contacted him and he said he had notified the main office to not bill me and he would contact them again. A week later when my account had not been credited with the withdrawal they made I contacted him again. He than tried to tell me I was to contact the main office which I did and was unable to talk to anyone. I filed a dispute against J.K. Harris and my bank said there was nothing they could do as I had sign permission for the withdrawal and jk harris would not reinburse me. Well I Paid $168. for 5 mins of consultation. So anyone in Minnesota if you are thinking of contacting a tax consultant do not go to J. K. Harris. They can not be trusted and do not adhere to their adverstisement. If you do go to one listen to them take the information home and read it before you sign anything. They make it sound good as to how much they can save you and are only interested in taking your money. I probably should be happy I got out of it for only $168. by cancelling my cash card otherwise they would of made two more debits to my account.
This is the letter I sent to JK Harris recently with no response from them. "First of all, to start this letter, let me say: I want my contract cancelled and I want my money back! That having been said, let me say that I think your company is a scam! I was promised help which I have never received. I am paying you good money which I can ill afford to help me with an IRS problem and as of today I am more in debt than when I started. Marilyn B who is listed as my case specialist has had only one response to my numerous questions of what is going on and that response is we are still waiting for the IRS to give us an answer to the recent Offer In Compromise we have filed. I have seen nothing since hiring you in February 2009 except for whatever I call and ask for. I have nothing that shows what is being done for my money. Just that same answer just waiting. I have spent hours on the phone with the IRS myself when I thought I was paying JK Harris to do that for me. One day I was on for 2 hours and 5 minutes. And just last week I was told by the IRS representative that seldom does the IRS accept Offers in Compromise. Why wasnt I told that up front? Why has it taken 7 months of my hoping something was being done to find this out? This same rep told me that each time JK Harris files another IOC, it invalidates everything I have set up with the IRS, i.e. Installment Agreement. On your page Things to Remember.. under Paragraph 3 it says that JK Harris will attempt to stay or remove a levy placed by the IRS. No! I did that myself, again with hours on the phone. Ms. B says I will be notified of any milestones in my case. Evidently there have been no milestones in 7 months because other than the times I have called and asked or e-mailed her I have gotten only one call from her updating me, which was still waiting. I should have gone on line and better checked out the complaints against JK Harris before I ever entered into an agreement with you. I feel I have been scammed out of the $500 I put down and the $176.48 I have paid monthly for the other 6 months. I should have read the fine print, of which there is lots, to see what you could take from my account. I want out of this contract immediately. You are not doing what you were hired do.
Hired them a few years ago to resolve a tax issue. Paid money upfront and they never used all of the retainer. In january was told I would get back a refund of 1400.00. The refund was to take 90 to 120 days. Here it is 10 months later and still dont have the refund. I am told by them they are trying to get a loan from a bank to clear up all of the refunds that they have. I feel like they are just giving me a story so I will just go away. Needed that refund to help pay my rent.I gave them the money when they asked for it, they should do the same.I complied with all the forms to grt a refund.
I went to jkharris for help, he promised me my case could be solved. that I would only have to pay the IRS $100.00 because of my situation. I asked was he positive because I couldn't afford to hire them if I still had to pay the IRS, so he guaranteed me it would be no problem,that he had handled cases just like mine in the past and they were solved for less than $200.00, so he was postive mine could be solved for $100.00 because my situation was wores than there's. so they started taking out about 244.00 a month out of my credit card, well when I got the paper work in the mail the priced had jumped to $700.00 which was still a lot better than what I owed. after the final payment a year and half later they would no longer return my calls, the IRS was calling me with threats of taking my home, car, garnishing my wages, even taking what little money I had in the bank. I left messages everyday, with still no reply from them. I finally got a hold of one of the girls that was supose to be helping me, she said she was sorry. I told her what the first jkharris guy had said, and she told me they couldn't make promises like that cause they didn't know how it would turn out. I'm very depressed, I cry all the time, I can't sleep.

I asked was he positive because I couldn't afford to hire them if I still had to pay the IRS, so he guaranteed me it would be no problem, that he had handled cases just like mine in the past and they were solved for less than $200.00, so he was postive my could be solved for $100.00 because my situation was wores than there's. so they started taking out about 244.00 a month out of my credit card, well when I got the paper work in the mail the priced had jumped to $700.00 which was still a lot better than what I owed. after the final payment a year and half later they would no longer return my calls, the IRS was calling me with threats of taking my home, car, garnishing my wages, even taking what little money I had in the bank. I left messages everyday,with still no reply from them. I finally got a hold of one of the girls that was supose to be helping me,she said she was sorry. I told her what the first jkharris guy had said, and she told me they couldn't make promises like that cause they didn't know how it would turn out.
Made an appointment. She had me fill out a bunch of forms. Signed them. JK HARRIS started to withdraw money from my checking account. Then a few months later the IRS started to garnish my weekly pay check. So JK HARRIS after taking $1200.00 form me told me I needed to hire a lawyer. And that they had a list of lawyers if I wanted to use one of theirs. So I just paid them $1200 to tell me I needed a lawyer. Well I'm out $1200.00 Needed to hire a lawyer. IRS $3000 from me before I could get things going with a bankruptcy lawyer.
They took my money and got me in a bigger mess than I was in. I now owe the IRS $14000.
I hired JK Harris to help me with my taxes. They were going to file my taxes and work out an agreement with the IRS on my behalf. I was told that they had offices in my area. I was given three packets to fill out. I was having problems filling out the forms, so I went to the office where I signed up. There was nobody there. I was told by the receptionist that they have a person there only on Thursday. I went on Thursday and got no help. I was told to fill out the forms and mail them to South Carolina. I needed help filling out the forms. I called the office in SC, and after several transfers, I got a recording saying that the person I was trying to reach was gone for the week. Nobody else could help me. After making several calls without getting any help, I decided to terminate my agreement with JK Harris. After two months, I got a letter in the mail stating that they were offering me $27.00. They had taken over $3,200 from my checking account and provided me no service at all, and they wanted me to settle for $27.00. I am seeking advice and will most likely sue them.
I worked for South Carolina Department of Consumer Affairs. About two years ago, the attorney general, Henry McMaster, came to our office and ordered our agency not to pursue consumer complaints against JK Harris. It seems Mr. McMaster is an old law partner of Charlie Condon, who was the attorney general before Henry. Mr. Condon is now in private practice. His sole client is JK Harris & Co. Our agency had almost a thousand complaints against JK Harris and we could not proceed with any of them. Hundreds of people lost tens of thousands of dollars and still JK Harris is in business.
I went to JK Harris to help with a tax problem that I had. They promised that they could get the IRS to settle for an amount that was not true. I cancelled their services and I want my $250 down payment back. It was promised to me. Then, they wrote me a letter saying they were going to keep my money. They have done no work but kept my money.
On Wednesday, June 17th, 2009, at 2 pm PST, I met with Gus ** who is a consultant for JK Harris and Co., Llc, a National Tax Representation firm. I met with the consultant at 177 Bovet Rd. San Mateo, CA, an office that had no JK Harris and Co., Llc logo or anything other than 3 folders that had the logo on them. It was the only thing in the office that represented this company but JK Harris and Co., Llc Headquarters are at 4995 Lacross Rd., Suite 1800, N. Charlston, NC 29406. The IRS had placed a levy against my checking account and the co. with whom I was contracting with. After seeing many tax resolution company commercials on TV and listening to them advise to never deal directly with the IRS because they are not going to help you but make life harder, it frightened me enough and made me afraid to deal directly with the IRS. After the meeting, I decided to acquire services from JK Harris and Co., Llc. I was told they would need two checks, one in the amount of $330 for them to set me up for quarterly taxes, the other in the amount of $500 to start the offer and compromise. I wrote out two checks and gave them to Gus **. After signing over power of attorney, I gave them permission to debit my debit card and take $500/month for them to continue to assist me with the tax issue and $55/month for them to assist me with quarterly taxes. After much reflection and recalling that the office didn't have any identifying logos and that the consultant had to go to his car to get the documents, it made me suspicious, so I decided to check out with the Better Business Bureau (which I should have done before signing anything). I found that the company had an F rating. On Monday, June 22, 2009, which was 3 business days after signing the contract, I decided to cancel my contract with JK Harris and Co., Llc. I faxed them a letter of cancellation to 877-504-1732 which is the number I was given by the company. And I also sent an email to cancel my contract. I requested a full refund of the $830 I paid. On June 23, 2009, I called the company to ensure they had received my letter and was told by one of the representatives that yes, they had received my request and it was being sent to their Resolution department and it would take 45 days to get an answer to my refund question. I received $330 check back voided but nothing of the $500 check. I have contacted the Better Business Bureau and they were in contact with JK Harris and Co., Llc and they kept saying that I cancelled on 6/24/09. On 8/21/09, I finally received an answer and they said that my request for a refund of the $500 was being denied. JK Harris and Co. Llc had done no work on my case because when I signed the papers, I was given a packet to fill out and needed to send them the information before they would start my case. It was Gus ** who told me this and also told me not to call the IRS. They wouldn't know who JK Harris and Co., Llc was because they use another name when dealing with the IRS (red flag). But I wanted help so bad I was only wanting to see that they could help me. Besides this is a nationwide co. (what a fool I was). I want other consumers to be made aware of these companies who are out there to steal money from people in my situation. After cancelling, I called the IRS directly and within an hour they had lifted the levy placed on my accounts and place of business and made a payment plan of $300/month. The IRS did all this for no money at all and the monthly payment will go to pay off the back taxes I owe. Please help advise me as to if I have a case in small claims court and how I can go about it. Thank you for letting me tell my story!
On March 20, 2009, I hired JK Harris to help me with my tax problems. I met with Randy ** in Hattiesburg. He explained that the company has three departments that would help me get on the right track. I made a down payment of $3,000.00 and they have been drafting $520.00 monthly out of my checking account. The drafts started in April of ‘09. They also have been drafting $55.00 monthly for my quarterly reporting. They said that the legal department would contact Walter ** with the IRS and get my taxes set up on a payment plan. They said that I made too much money to "negotiate" with the IRS about the amount due. On April the 9th, I received a call from JK Harris’ legal department that Mr. ** gave me another 30 days to get all of my tax returns to him. On April the 9th, I also hand delivered to the IRS the bank statements, proof of income, list of assets and liabilities. I then faxed these to JK Harris. When I had delivered my tax returns to Mr. ** at the IRS, he said that he had received a letter that David ** had sent a letter that he was no longer representing me. I called JK Harris at that time and was told that I would be assigned another person. Until 6/15/09, I never had any contact from JK Harris. On 6/15/09, I received an email with forms to complete from Shellie **. I replied back to her. I told her that I had already completed these and had provided them to the IRS and JK Harris. I never received a reply back. Then on Friday afternoon, 8/14/2009, I opened a letter from Walter ** at the IRS. The letter stated that I had failed to comply to the deadline that he had given and there were four levies also enclosed. One was for my employer, one for my bank’s checking account. I emailed Ms. ** and asked her to contact me that day. I also got the name of her supervisor which was Latasha **. I faxed all of my correspondence to both of them. I never got a return call. The next day I got an email from Ms. ** stating that she called my number, but the individual said that she had a wrong number. She listed the correct number that she had supposedly tried to call. She never called the alternate number that I had left either. Her email stated “nevertheless, I still need these forms". I did explain in my email that now I have no income. I am paid by 1099. My employer told me that he is to withhold 100%. She did not try to explain or even seem concerned that I have no income. I am going to end up losing my home and everything that I have worked very hard for, but JK Harris is not concerned! They are concerned about taking my money and nothing else! My income seized (paid by 1099) so my employer has to withhold entire income. Checking account also levied. I cannot pay my house note, car note, or any household bills. I have no income as of 8/17/09. My employer is letting me continue to work to see if I can get some type of relief, but JK Harris has not shown any urgency in this matter. I have worked with my employer for 14 years and have built a residual commission base. My 1099 is each year for the last two years was $140,000. Now, I may lose my entire career due to their negligence.
I signed up with JKH in Nov 08 to help with review audit and reduce penalty. After sending them everything and advising me to become an LLC, they totally dropped the ball. Mark himself told me this. Nothing had been done. Mary ** had not done anything on the case. Also, Nateshia ** had not done anything. She was in the bookkeeping part of it. Other people dealt with Mirian ** (any kin to Mary **?). Michael **, Robert **, they reduced our audit to $4000 and did not audit anything. Then, they have taken $250 out of our checking since that time. But of all the ones, the one that assured us of their reputation and results was Mr. Rodney ** of North Charleston, SC. These people are amazing and I feel for it, paid for it with a heart attack last Thursday after getting the levy notice from the IRS, so I am requesting a refund and an apology. I thought carpetbagging went out with the war.
On May 27th 2008, I made a contract with JK Harris. I paid the amount of $300.00 for services to fix my tax and settlement, IRS tax problems. The contract was made to pay on monthly basis on work done. The financial company of JK Harris pulled from my bank, Citibank, the amount of $3,100.00 plus the $300.00 upfront. The total amount of $3,400.00 was pulled from the bank. JK Harris Rob and Fraud - used my account to rob money from me. I informed the bank, and the bank closed the account and gave me another account. JK Harris has their license revoked since 1999 and they do not return my money.
On February 25, 2009, I met with an agent from JK Harris about my tax issues. He informed me that they can get it worked out. I had to pay a $700 downpayment. He broke it into two payments. The first payment of $250 was due April 3, then the other was due April 17. I paid the $250 then I felt like something was not right so I ended their services. I asked for my $250 back then they told me it would have to come from the oversight and review board. I called. No one would call me back. On July 17, someone from JK Harris review board called and left me a message saying, "I would get my $250 back in 5 to 10 business days." On July 22, I got a letter in the mail from JK Harris saying they were not going to refund my money. I called to see what was going on. The agent told me he doesn't know what the problem was but he will get someone to call me back. It is now August 14. I have not heard anything from them, no letters, and no calls. They are scam artists. Everyone needs to be aware of them. Someone needs to do something about them. This is not right!
I had JK Harris & Company prepare my '04, '05 and '06 taxes. Not only did they charge me over a thousand dollars to do nothing, but they also reported me to the credit agencies when I refused to continue with their services. They did not negotiate with the IRS or even advise me with my tax issues. I feel that I paid them a lot of money and received nothing in return. I am now still dealing with those same tax issues. My wages are being garnished and I still owe state taxes in two states. They did nothing with the IRS for me.
On December 11, 2008, I went to the JK Harris office in Texas to help fix a tax issue with SC Department of Revenue. The representative, James **, assured me that they could help me. He talked me into the tax planning program for $1,500.00. They deducted the money from the wrong account and when I tried calling and emailing, I received no response. I received an email from Corey **, introducing himself and assuring me he would promptly take care of my tax problem. I received an email from SC Department of Revenue asking for the amended returns, which I forwarded to Corey **. I received no response. I called and left a voice message and still did not get a response. I called again and found out that Mr. ** had been promoted and that my case had been given to Wachovia **. I called Ms. ** and she informed me it was tax season and she would get to it after the season was over. I told her that was not acceptable and faxed her my letter from the SC Department of Revenue. I asked her to contact Kim ** there and let her know the holdup was their fault. I waited 5 weeks and called again since nothing had happened and Ms. ** said she had not heard anything from them. When I called JK Harris again, they informed me they had turned my case over to Williams **. He told me he was researching SC law and that he was having personal problems and would get it done as soon as possible. I waited another 6 weeks and called back again. I asked for a supervisor and told them this needed to be completed. I was starting to get extremely mad. I had been patient, but this was ridiculous. The supervisor said it would be mailed out promptly, which is July 2009, not a very prompt service. I received the amended returns 2 days later. The next day, a letter was sent to say they had filled out the form incorrectly and the new forms were the correct ones. I felt very unsure of their work and decided to take my problem to HR Block in Brunswick, Georgia where I am working. They have been done and they are not anything like what I received from JK Harris. I want a full refund of $650.00 for the tax service they did not do correctly and a refund of $1,500.00 for the tax planning that I can not trust to use and is a waste of money. I do not believe that JK Harris is a reputable company at all.
I have been strung along about my IRS case and being told to not talk to the IRS. And now, the IRS has levied my checking account for $13,000. I am being evicted from my home, and I have a 5-year-old living with me. I have been on the phone all day, trying to get a refund of $866.00, which I have paid to them to stop this levy. I guess I need to find a attorney to try and sue to get my money back.
I should've read this website before I even bothered calling them, but the good thing is that I canceled my check before they processed it, and am in the process of requesting a refund and formally terminating our agreement. So far, I've not heard back from anyone from their organization. A couple of years ago, I originally paid TRS a ton of cash, and after I had the same experience as some of the customers here with JKH, decided to go with them. I figured I couldn't get scammed by two different companies, but I was obviously wrong. Anyway, I went in for my "free consultation", and met with a "consultant" (according to his business card) - not even a CPA or former IRS, and am guessing he was just a sales guy. He more or less scared me to death after explaining horror stories to me, and convinced me to sign up because I couldn't do it alone. Of course this, was after he told me about one of their success stories. After reading the reviews here, and realizing I had made a mistake, I started reading their terms and conditions. Here is an excerpt about who will perform the work: "The vast majority of work on your case, including data gathering, form preparation and verification of supporting documents, is performed by trained employees called Case Specialists who are located at JKH's offices in Charleston, SC. Case Specialists receive approx. 40 hours of classroom training, in addition to on the job training, using training materials similar to those used by the IRS. The CS works with our pro Licensed Taxpayer Rep (LTR) who handle the review of your file and the negotiations with the IRS or state taxing authority. LTRs are attorneys, CPAs, or Enrolled Agents and are also located in SC. All communications regarding your case will come through your CS unless one of our LTRs requires info directly from you. Consultants do not have access to your account info and will not be able to answer questions regarding case progressions. " So the BS my "consultant" gave me in that I will be interfacing through him is obviously not true, and he has no access to any of my info even though I would be submitting everything they needed to him. Also, I'm shocked that most all the work will be done by people who received 40 hours of classroom training - basically a bunch of clerical admins, and not tax pros like I was expecting. Anyway, unless they try and collect their money, I got off easy, and didn't have to pay them a dime. Finally, I called the IRS directly, and agreed to go on a 60-month payment plan after the guy from JKH told me that it would not be possible. Note: after having several conversations with various IRS folks over the last month or so, it all depends on who you end up talking to - some are very willing to work with you, and others are just out to get your blood.
This is huge scam. They ripped us off for $4,600. We owed $50,000 and they said we would only have to pay $1,200. In the initial interview, the guy plugs in numbers in his laptop and presto bingo! We can only afford to pay the IRS $1,200. So we signed up with $1,200 downpayment and debit my account for $360 monthly for 11 months, and after six months, they say according to the documents I sent into their office they calculated that I can pay $35,000. There's a big difference between $1,200 and $35,000.
They're just completely incompetent and don't know what they're doing. They mailed back my returns stating that all I needed to do was sign and mail in to the IRS. One small problem - they forgot to attach my W2s which caused the IRS to kick them back and made me miss the filing deadline. It's their inattention to detail which is just one small reason why everyone should stay far away from this company. To top things off, they debited my account twice for their fee, then no one would return my calls to fix their mistake. I finally had to get my bank involved to straighten out the mess they caused. Who knows how badly they actually screwed things up? I only pray that the fine from the IRS is not too bad.
I signed on with J.K. Harris in April 2007 after I had my wages garnished. They told me that they could help me and asked for $400 up front then $333 a month for the next few years. I gathered all necessary information and sent it over to them. They prepared one set of tax returns, which were incorrect, so they had to prepare another. One I discovered was still incorrect, two years later. I sent all of the financial information to them in May 2008. I was asked for it again in July and August 2008. When I received a letter that they didn't know about in September 2008 which gave me a specific date to file my financial information with the IRS, I called J.K. Harris. No one returned my call. I emailed them three times and called a few more times. Finally, I got someone on the phone who told me that they couldn't get the paperwork done that fast as they were still missing some items - items I had sent in May, July, and August. I said I would send the info to the IRS myself, which I did. I was able to prevent the IRS from freezing my bank accounts on my own. When I spoke to the agent at the IRS, he mentioned that they get a lot of people who are dealing with J.K. Harris who have to take back over their own cases. He told me that people are better off to work directly with the IRS as the same rules apply to both them and individuals. I can file my own offer in compromise and if I have questions about how to fill it out, I can sit down with an IRS agent in my local IRS office (yes, a human) and they would assist me. So, I called J.K. Harris and demanded my money back. I was told that it had paid for all the hours of work they had done. What work? Wrong tax filings, and that's it? I called my bank and told them under no circumstances are they to process anything from J.K. Harris. I pulled my LPOA as well. I emailed J.K. Harris to let them know they were fired, so that I would have back up of my contact with them. They sent me a notice informing me that I was still to pay out the remaining balance due. I told them they could sue me for it and I would counter sue them. They attempted to process one more payment and called when it was returned to try to get money. Then they left me alone for 6 months. After which, I got a call telling me my account was past due. I told them I had fired them in October 2008 and there was nothing past due about that. She had no record of me firing them. So, I asked what paperwork they had sent to the IRS in the last 6 months on my behalf. Her answer was nothing. So, if they weren't "fired," what were they doing for 6 months that I should be paying for? She said they were waiting for me to contact them to let them know what I wanted them to do about the potential bank account freeze from September 2008. I have been working with the IRS on my own for two years now. They are slightly easier to deal with. It took them 2 years to set me up on a payment plan. They also don't believe in calling you back or sending you information, unless it's a letter stating their intent to do something. It is up to you to call them back after they have stated they would do something, hold for an hour, and start all over. I now have a levy against me from the IRS because of the IRS not following up with me, despite me being placed on a payment plan. All of this because I hired a company that isn't worth the papers they have you sign.
Our complaint is just exactly like the other complaints on this site. I'm sorry we didn't read this site before we signed on with these crooks. They took our money, insisted on bank draft and we have spent countless hours compiling and sending them paperwork which they requested. We never get calls returned. They even blocked our emails. They went past the deadline to prevent bank levy, then could not get it reversed. The IRS completely drained our bank account. We paid $2,000.00 on the front end for this not to happen. The representative (salesman) guaranteed we would owe very little. If you ever can get in touch with anyone, they will immediately say we haven't sent them something they need even though it should be in their hands. We end up searching for it and sending it again. Of course, we have sent letters demanding the return of our money by registered, return receipt. They never accepted it. We finally decided to go to IRS on our own. The IRS agent said that they had nothing in their files requesting a stay of levies. They were threatening to levy our SS benefits. The IRS is now working with us directly and we can actually talk to someone. They might not save us any money, but at least we know where we stand and they are not promising things that cannot be done. We are resigned to the fact that our government will stay on our backs until we die. We are past retirement age and cannot make enough money in the rest of our lifetime to pay them off. They at least doubled the amount we should have been charged and will continue to add to it. Aside from JK Harris, we believe legislation should be able to help taxpayers with unscrupulous revenue agents. They have no controls on them and can do whatever they want. JK Harris has stolen our money. It might be possible to go to small claims court to get them to return our $3,000.00. But guess we would have to stand in line for that. It seems all the other complainants have had the same problems.
I have had the same experience as the other people. JK Harris completely ignored my case, and I was in direct contact with the IRS. I asked my first case worker if she wanted the information that I was sending to the IRS, and she said, "No, just send them what they want." JK Harris case workers never paid attention to deadline dates. They first said that I could pay $5400. Then the IRS said for me to pay $1700. My case worker ignored this and said, "We have to wait until they decline the $5400." So by completely ignoring the IRS, she gave them a deadline to come up with a plan, and that plan was for me to pay the entire amount of $45,000. They completely screwed me.
I contracted with JK Harris on 2-29-08 based on TV and radio ads promising to settle past due taxes with the IRS and state. I have paid them over $3300 over this time period. Every time I requested an update, they would tell me my caseworker had been promoted and turn me over to someone new who would request that I submit the previous 3 months income, bills, bank statements, etc. I have submitted these documents multiple times. I was threatened with a lien on my home and once again called them as their ads state they can prevent this. I was told again to submit 3 more months of the above, which I did. The lien was filed anyway, and my caseworker responded by stating, "That doesn't mean a thing; just that if you try to sell the house, the IRS can take the money." How comforting! Time has gone on and last week, I was threatened with a wage levy. My caseworker told me to send her the info, along with my employer's payroll person's name, phone and fax numbers. I did. She then told me that I could go ahead and fill out the papers for my employer as she "would have this stopped before the employer even sent the info in." I received my check today with 90% of my pay levied out. The amount I took home won't pay my light bill, much less my car, house, etc. I have called them 5-6 times today, left messages each time for my caseworker and also sent 3-4 emails to her and her supposed supervisor - no response. The people who answer the phone say the power of attorney is working on it. Meanwhile, I have no money. I don't know if I should contact the IRS directly and try to arrange something. I do know it is criminal what these people have done. How can a business such as this continue to run after the state lawsuits and all the complaints? The complaints are virtually identical. That many random people couldn't possibly be that on the mark and be wrong. They have a refund policy if you act within 18 months and release them from all liability - how convenient.
I paid the company $3000. A year later, no action has been taken and they told me they could not help me. Now, I owe the IRS twice as much as I did before. I'm stressed from owing over $79,000 to IRS and having paid J.K. Harris $3000.
I contracted with J.K. Harris in January 2008 about my back taxes. After seeing their ads on TV, I thought maybe we could get what is owed reduced. No attempt was ever made by them to negotiate with the IRS, even after the amount was bumped up, almost double, because of penalties and interest. They also told me that I shouldn't be in communication with the IRS and that they would handle all that. However, I have had to contact the IRS several times about different things and also tell the IRS that they should contact J.K. Harris about my case. It seems the different IRS offices around the country don't communicate with each other. Just when I thought things were coming to a resolution, the IRS notified us that they would levy part of my wife's Social Security payments. Now, the IRS has levied my checking account, freezing all the money in there. I'm hoping J.K. Harris can rectify this problem within the 21 days allowed, because I have no money.
My husband and I entered into a contract agreement with JK Harris a year ago with the understanding the company would represent us with Federal and State Income Tax problems. Our tax files are for multiple years, and when we met the representative, we were told that we did not need to worry anymore, because with them representing us, they could get our taxes reduced. All we needed to do was to make a downpayment and additional $1,400 to cover other expenses. Hearing this was music to our ears, because we had labored over this problem for years and we would finally be relieved of the stress and anxiety, worrying about closing these accounts. There were lots of phone calls and letters written to JK Harris asking questions and providing duplicate information. We never received an answer to our questions. This did not set well with us. We are elderly people with multiple medical problems and did not need the stress this company has created. After a period of waiting for something to happen, I contacted both tax agencies and learned that JK Harris had not contacted these agencies on our behalf at any time. The tax people did acknowledge they have on file a power of attorney for JK Harris that we have officially voided on June 29, 2009. There was no recent activity on our accounts, and we have decided we would take the responsibility of completing this process on our own. We have cut ties with this company, filed complaints with the appropriate agencies, and asked for our refund plus damages. None of the services we were told we would received materialized. We were shown little respect, we could not trust them, and we never could believe that our case was important to them, because of lack of results. Each month a payment from our account of $148.00 was taken like clock work for services we never received. The company misrepresented itself, provided false advertising information, and has defrauded customers across the country. They have lawsuits everywhere. We need to file a suit; this company is scamming and ripping off people.
I had a large tax to pay in 2005. JK Harris ads say we will help you pay pennies on the dollars, so I contacted them to see if they could help. They immediately called me back and then set up a meeting. Yes, it was in the back room of an office that they were renting just for appointments and not a nice one. My counselor told me they could help me and I needed to sign up today because there was no time to waste, I did. I felt like promises were made and as I look back, they could never have been kept. I had levies put against my bank accounts and liens against my home. I recommend that you talk to the tax advocate at the IRS and research the internet for what can really be done before entering any contract with JK Harris or other first that prey on those that have financial troubles. The first thing my consultant Sowell did was ask me questions about what my expenses were and how much money did I make at my job. At the time, I did not have a job and had not had one because I was a stay at home mom and widowed. Her first recommendation was Federal Installment Agreement (W-2/Sch C). The cost of this was $3125.00. What she did not tell me is that in order to file for a Federal Installment Agreement, you have to have been employed to show some income coming in from a job. Recently, when I filed for a refund with the review and oversight, I was told they would have to investigate. Seeing a 0 on my contract for income put there by their paid consultant was not proof enough for them. They are taking it under review and 60 days from the day you talk to them, they will send you a letter and tell you what their findings were. I paid $750.00 for a State Installment Agreement (W2/SCH C). This would let them notify my state that they were working with me and set up another payment plan, but my state was never notified. Money in their pocket and a lien on my house. The thing to really watch is the Prepare Abatement of Penalty Request (Federal). The cost of this was $2200.00. What they don't tell you is the total tax, interest and penalty must be paid first before you can file for this. If you don't have the money to pay in the first place, how can they prepare an abatement? I signed an agreement that they could be my Power of Attorney. After contacting the IRS advocate office, I withdrew that POA and have been working with the IRS and it is a lot less expensive and things are getting accomplished because I am in control and more worried about my affairs than JK Harris. It was my tax advocate who told me how to make a request for my money on the back of your contract and kept her advised on what I said and how I was doing in the process. What have I learned? Be sure to date everything you do with them because your 60 days starts from that date. They like to make it from the day that you talked to them if you can get an answer. I left messages and waited days for callbacks. They have several offices and be sure to send all request to all offices because they do not update records very often and if you do not have a copy of a letter you sent to another office, the 60 days starts when it arrives in the office you are talking to. Be sure if you mail any information to them that you send it priority or overnight with delivery confirmation. I sent a letter on the 13th. USPS said it was delivered 4 days later. Weekend in there and they received it on the 22nd according to their records. When asking for your money back, it is not important to them and they did not consider it a scam that they had charged me $6,075 for services they could not and did not perform. The answer was they were very busy with other refunds (confirmation to me) to put mine ahead of anyone else, I would just have to wait my turn. Please research your options well and contact the IRS and see what you can do. During the contract period when I asked about the pennies on the dollars, their response was "not all customers are the same and you do not qualify". Why wasn't I told this in the beginning? I would have thought more and not signed. Hard lesson and still fighting to get my money back because it is important to me.
They did not complete their end of contract. I requested my money back. I even signed general release over year ago. They owe $1,400 just on contract. I paid my taxes and have wasted many hours. I have been lied to and stress was beyond belief. They should pay thousands for the stress they caused.
I paid them $1400 to help make out of a tax problem. They did not ever contact the IRS about my case and jerked me around and I ended up contacting the IRS myself and having to set up payments which I could have done in the first place and now I have been trying to get my refund from them, which they promised I would receive for 2 years. They are complete frauds and I get so mad when I see their ads on TV, I could scream. We are two old people living on social security and every dollar is precious to us.
In November 2007, my husband and I met with JK Harris regarding our 2005 taxes. The IRS was stating that we owed $9,000 but with interest/penalties, it was over $20,000. The representative assured us that due to my husband's illness and the amount of income, we were 100% certain that we would not have to pay anything to the IRS but we had to sign a contract to pay JK Harris $3,000. We were able to talk to someone when we called but never really got any solid information. My husband passed away on July 20, 2008 so the disability I was receiving for him was stopped. I finally got JK Harris paid off March 2009 and now I can't get anyone to answer my calls or return my emails. Of course, my refund for 2008 $795 was kept by the IRS and the amount I owe has gone up to $25,000 now and they are saying they are going to put a lien on everything I own. I am about ready to go to the local TV and see if they will do a segment on them especially after reading all the other complaints listed here. I will probably lose everything I own. I can't sleep because of worrying about this and received no benefit from the $3,000 I paid JK Harris and I had to do without food and some medications each month to pay for the services they supposedly were providing to me.
I contacted JK Harris to approach the IRS about 47K tax liability. I was told they would jump on the case and get the debt reduced along with interest and penalties. They sat on my case and avoided all calls and emails until they sent me my 2008 returns which weren't even completed. I called to ask why the return wasn't completed and never heard back from them. I sopped paying hem and finally heard back from them. They claim they never told me they would do something to address my tax liability. They now claim they were hired to develop a business plan for me. What? I'm not a business, I'm an individual taxpayer. I have refused all requests for more money from them until they can produce some actual work product relating to the tax liability. As the IRS agent told me, there is no magic bullet for IRS issues. And none of these companies ever produce results for their clients. Just look at all of the complaints for all of these companies.
JK Harris stole $2900 from me. They told me they could get my $32,000 tax debt (due to illness and a 38% tax rate on retirement benefits that I screwed up myself. ALWAYS use a tax pro!) reduced to $3,000. JK Harris jerked me around for a full year, by which time I either had to enter into a payment agreement with the IRS or face prison time. In the end, JK Harris did absolutely NOTHING for me, and in all actuality, made things much worse. They are criminals, pure and simple. I finally recovered around $1,400 of my money through class action suits and small claims action, but that leaves $1,500 that JK Harris STOLE from me! They can do NOTHING for you that you can't do for yourself by just talking to the IRS. There is no magic pill that JK Harris can use to make the IRS go away. They'll just make you THINK they can, and in the end they'll just steal your money and get you into worse trouble with the IRS. AVOID THEM AT ALL COSTS!!!!!!!
Lack of service, no follow-up, paid 1700.00 and received nothing in return from JK Harris only that they could arrange repayment with IRS which I could do myself. No return calls when filed complaint. Now owe more than before dealing with them. Contract I signed when dealing with them and paying them 1700.00 said they would reduce my debt by 70%, now told I make too much and have to repay all, be aware of this company and what they promise
On july 10,2008, I met with a rep from JK Harris in a "BARROWED OFFICE" (should of been a clue right there!!!!!).My wife and i fell into tax problems of over $20,000,The JK Harris rep told us that his company could get our tax dept reduced to arround $750.00 to $1,200 because of "THEIR SPECIAL KNOWLEDGE OF THE TAX GAME"!! Being in tax dept for three years and feeling like a thief for not paying our taxes,we felt such a relief that our nightmare could soon be over,IF WE ONLY KNEW IT WAS JUST GETTING STARTED!!!! We faxed document after document to them and never hearing back from them (thinking everything being done as promised),finally after several moths of not hearing from them, I called too see where we were at this time,was SHOCKED to hear from a "linda" that NO DOCUMENTS HAVE YET BEEN RECIEVED FROM US! I told linda that all the documents asked for was faxed(lucky i kept records of fax dates with comfirmation docs from fax ) she just said srry-nothing is here,I told her to stay there that im faxing over and want her to stand by fax machine,she relucantly said she would, since then NOTHING- NOTHING has been done,we are recieving threating letters from the IRS stating that OUR HOME OF 24 YEARS IS GOING TO BE TAKIN FROM US. Calling JK Harris co and all we get is THEIR IN A MEETING AND WILL CALL U BACK WHEN MEETING IS THREW, NO CALL BACK EVER, its been over a year and again NOTHING HAS BEEN DONE! If your reading this and thionking of contacting JK Harris co for help, PLEASE DONT!!!!! AGAIN PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!!!!!!! BUT IF YOU ARE USING THIS COMPANY AND FEEL THE SAME AS MY WIFE AND I-- WE WOULD LIKE TO FORM A LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE TO TAKE THIS COMPANY TO COURT AND SEW NOT ONLY FOR OUR MONEY BACK BUT ALSO LOSS OF TIME AND GRIEF!!!!
As a result of divorce, and a business my ex-wife and I had sunk our savings into, I found myself owing the IRS over $161,000. I contacted JK Harris out of a desire to remain anonymous with local attorneys and CPAs. My mistake was made out of a lack of experience, making emotional decisions and feeling criminal for not being able to pay my fair share of taxes. I should have known beter when they wanted $7,500 to resolve my issues and for representation with the IRS. I negotiated to $5,500 and feeling as though I had made progress to resolve the issues. It was only the beginning. I cannot begin to describe the encounter, except for saying what many others have, they did nothing. Absolutely nothing. No return calls, many voicemails that went unreturned and actually found the IRS far easier to deal with. I simply want to warn others to NEVER contract with this firm. They are ineffectual at best and criminal at worst. At the end of the day, you will simply waste valuable time dealing with this shell of a company, simply hire an attorney and avoid yourself a headache.
JK Harris screwed us. It's been over a year and a half. We called numerous times. Today we called them & now they tell us they did all they could. And they told us that our case has been transfered to another person. The never ever call or let us know what is happening with our case. The refused to refund us because of lack of services. First they tell us when we hired them we would only pay a fraction of the amount we owe the IRS. Then, and this is many mounts later, they are still working on the case. Also JK Harris agreed at the time we signed up, they will also represent us with our New York State Taxes. The problem with that is today they tell us they have not done anything with New York State. The IRS tells us that we pay too much rent. JK Harris never informed us about a limit to the amount of rent we need to pay. This is after signing a two year lease. All this information we got was because of phone calls we made to either IRS or JK Harris. We never know who our JK Harris representative ever is or was. Each time we call we are told that we "now have a new representative". when we started with JK Harris, our income was (our new rep is now A. johnson) very low. We lost our house in Hernendo, Fl. Since we moved our income has gotten better. But, only after we moved. Also when we signed with JK Harris I did not receive SSI until a few mounts before we moved to our rental. Since we moved to our new address and only then our income has improved. It was only after then that the IRS told us we make too much & pay too much rent. WE CALLED IRS. NOT JK HARRIS. What in the world do they do? Keep our money & sit on there rear. JK Harris sat on our case too long.(we spoke to a William no last name) Even JK Harris said they took too long. Talking too them is like talking to a brick wall. JK Harris never gives a straight answer, always give us some kind of double talk. We were paying the IRS $62. JK Harris tole us to not pay the IRS anymore because they are handling our case. JK Harris promises you when you sign up with them that "you will pay only a fraction of what you owe the IRS" EVEN in the TV ad JK Harris says that. This is not the only complaint against them. Just go on the internet. The list is endless. The only thing we did not do is check JK Harris before we signed with them. Is there something we can do? Or is it too late. The only advice we have is DO NOT UES JK HARRIS. We are so behind that we now filing bankruptcy. Is there anything we could do.
we are owed a refund of over $2600.00 and have waiting over one year. Every phone call to them is to no avail. They keep telling us it is being processed but nothing ever comes of it. They have proven to be a scam!
JK Harris promised to reduce my tax owed. They did not. They have not done anything for me and I am still paying them.
Several years ago, I went through the divorce from hell. One of the repercussions was the failure to pay taxes. It was my fault, but I was under tremendous stress and wasn't functioning normally. Nonetheless, I needed legal representation with the IRS. I hired JK Harris to represent me and after almost 2 years of trying to contact someone at the company to help, they never did anything for me. I eventually realized the company was a total scam. I am not alone; search the web for JK Harris Scam and you will learn it is not a reputable company. They claim to be the largest company defending taxpayers. However, check out their website (Backtaxes.com) and you will not find an address or central location listed. The address I used in this complaint was my so-called contact for assistance. I wound up paying the IRS a huge amount of money but it was the money that I paid JK Harris and never received one iota of assistance that burned me more than anything else. read more hide
We were completely scammed by these vultures. We would love to be able to have any guidance or help in addressing this outrageous rip-off. We contracted with these scam artists in good faith to the tune of $3200 and the only contact we had was when they sent us a payment contract and an unsigned letter terminating the contract. They did absolutely nothing! All calls were made by us to find out the progress being made. We simply wanted some help to make things right with the IRS. When we contacted the IRS, they threatened garnishment, which they did for 2001, for $7000 that not a penny of that went to 2001. We had filed all of our returns to current and $12,000 plus went for taxes 14 years ago. We were simply desperate for some help in understanding and resolving our tax issues. The only thing we gained with JK Harris was a huge fee we couldn't afford and untold frustration and heartache. My biggest wish is to be able to warn others of what a complete scam this is and to stop these people from hurting more people than they already have. If anyone, anywhere can offer some insight to this, please let us know. read more hide
They got me too. 4 years and $4000 later, and I owe IRS more than when it started. I can't count the times I had sent them my info, and now they want me to do it again so they can set me up on payment plan of $61,000.00; that was only $41,000.00 when they told me I could pay $1200.00 and be through. Oh yeah, they can’t stop a lien or levy neither. I know I have them, I know what needs to be done with these crooks but tar and feathers are hard to come by. Plus, I may be in up to my scalp in debt with Uncle Sam. I like to live. read more hide
I contracted with JK Harris in May 2008 to settle about $11k in IRS debt from tax years 2004 and 2005, penalties and interest. I paid $1,500 upfront with assurances that my federal taxes would be reduced by half. I sent the large amount of financial information to JK Harris as requested and waited. In the meantime, I continued to get letters from the IRS about my past taxes. Today, April 8, JK Harris emailed me completed tax returns with a total amount owed of $9,400 - not including any interest or payments the IRS may add! Needless to say, this is a far cry from the half off I was assured when I contracted with them last year. I emailed them to ask the sense in filing their returns, when what the IRS will likely add in penalties and interest will total more than what the IRS said I owed them in the first place, prior to involving JK Harris. I'm holding out hope that there's some good news in this, that there's simply something I'm not understanding. But in reading the reviews on this site and others, it seems I've fallen prey to JK Harris' overinflated advertising and baseless, misleading promises. Absent clarification from JK Harris and significant reduction of my tax burden, I will seek a refund. If that proves to be as difficult as other dissatisfied clients say it is, I'll be filing a lawsuit against JK Harris. read more hide
In 2005, we paid a JK Harris attorney at his rented office space $3600 to settle my back taxes. I completed the intensive paperwork and turned it in to the attorney who forwarded it for processing. When I attempted to reach JK Harris to discuss why there had not been any progress, I was told they never received the paperwork. My relationship with JK Harris immediately went to a hostile one because the representative acted like a bill collector to me. To this day, no work was done with the IRS. I requested a refund. They agreed to a partial refund, but have not paid it. When we follow up by email (there is no one to speak with by phone), they respond by saying they are not able to pay now, and they are sorry about that. I want to be part of a class action lawsuit. Who do I speak with? read more hide
These remarks are like so many others I have read on the internet at different sites. This is my scenario with JK Harris & Co. and how I resolved the issue and got a refund. On 11/07/2007 I met with a Richard **. He explained the whole process of JK Harris and what was involved. He then asked me all kinds of questions and within an hour, he told me he could reduce my taxes from around $50,000 at the time to about $3,200. I was stunned and amazed at the same time. I thought if it sounded too good to be true, it probably is! These are professionals and should know what they are talking about. I signed the necessary paperwork and said, "Let's get this thing rolling." Within a week JK Harris called and we were rolling. Through weeks of preparation because my problem was both business and personal, they got working. This cost me $5,650 for the OIC and $450 for them to do my taxes for 2007. In February 2008, they sent the final OIC offer for me to review. The figure wasn't even close. Their total was $47,373. I was furious to say the least. I immediately called them and they said they would review my numbers. They did and said this is what I owed. I argued they did nothing for me. They gained me $3,000 with the IRS and I paid them $6,000. I told them to not do my 2007 taxes and refund my money. I had to sign a waiver and they refunded me $325. I then told them I want my $5,650 refunded. They sent me another form and I went back and forth with the Review and Oversight Board for about 3 months. I finally decided to sign the waiver and take a loss here also. I was more interested in getting as much as possible refunded. By signing, I agreed to a refund of $3,743 out of $5,650. The form states 90 to 120 days before expecting the refund. The stress over back taxes alone is tremendous, let alone have a company like JK Harris prey on you for more money. I waited and called JK Harris so many times and finally decided enough was enough. In January 2009, I searched the internet and immediately found out that 13 states had filed suit against JK Harris and PA was one of them. I contacted the PA Attorney General's office immediately. They took some information, told me to go to a website and print out a form and send it to them along with all correspondence from JK Harris and myself. In March 2009 an associate from the Attorney General's office called and told me that JK Harris claimed they paid me in December 2008. I told her they didn't and she said she was going to call again and ask for a copy of the cancelled check. On March 24, 2009, a person from JK Harris called and told me to expect a check for $3,743 within a week. On March 30, 2009 I received the check. Everyone, contact your state Attorney General's office. File a complaint with them. Give them all the facts and paperwork and see what they can do. There are no guarantees it will work like my case, but what do you have to lose? It's free and it's your right. read more hide
Don't do what JK Harris claims they can do for you when you can do it for yourself. The IRS simply want the money you owe them. They will be glad to take the money that you are paying JK Harris. I had to call every week to get my money back. You got to be like an agressive credit card collector and they will get tired of you calling every week trust me it works. read more hide
We were having some trouble paying our back taxes because of the economic hard times I'm sure everyone is going through. We went to JK Harris for help. A man in a small local office promised us it could be reduced in no time and that attornys would be working on our case. He also promised us that all leans and levies would completely stop. We paid a large amount of money for him to do this for us. After 7 months with no word from anyone with JK Harris and a lien nitice from the IRS I fired them and am in the process of trying to get my money back.(wich will happen or I will file a civil lawsuit and get it.) We are now so financially behind its not funny and we cant even sell anything to get the money because there is a lean on our properties. This has taken a toll on our marriage and family. I just pray the outcome of this doesn't turn out much worse. My husband has even considered just going to jail to settle it. I begged him not to so we've been doing everything else we can. My husban and I love each other very much along with our 2 children. I don't know what to do! My husban is working daylight to dark tryin to get us out of this mess and I cant get a job because we have no one to watch our children even if I could find one.(wich the unemployment rate in our county is 15%)Please pray for us. read more hide
We went to meet with them and the gentleman told us that we did not have to pay the IRS. Instead pay them. That was not true. They kept taking money out of our account but not doing anything.

My Wife and I paid HK Harris at an office in San Diego $1300.00 to file back taxes. Evidentally, they sent the case to another office. After more than 8 months of repeated inquiries, we received a package stating that we owed $12,000 in back taxes. We took the paperwork to a local tax consultant who found numerous, large mistakes in JK Harris' work. We re-filed through the local agent, and received over $300.00 back in taxes. I explained all of this to JK Harris in faxes to Ms. Belinda Williams, but received no response. We paid $1,300.00 to a tax professional and received erroneous consultant services which would have cost us $12,00.00. I've been taken for at least $1,300.00. read more hide
Requested and was granted a REFUND, because they had done nothing for me except cost me $5200. To date I have not received my REFUND it has now been 8 months since I was told I would receive the refund within 90 days.

After contacting JK Harris they assured me that this was a cut and dry case no problem they would settle with the IRS for pennies on the dollar. Over the past two years I have spoken to no lees than four Company Reps.I made my down payment and they began taking payments from my account on a monthly basis. Iheard nothing from them and call repetedly . I rarly spoke to my caseworker (C. Jackson) who said she had it all under control (when I did get to speak to her). Finaly I spoke with my new caseworker (K. Chapman) who informed me that Ms. Jackson had failed to send the proper documents in and the IRS would be turning my case down, I would be paying the full balance plus interest. AS a father of four I have been scapping to find to monies to pay these scam artist plus fees for filing and forms that are probably bogus. I'm out of my 1200 down payment, 900 in filing and paper work fees, and another 2800 in monthly payments . Not to mention the torment of knowing the IRS can take my check at any time. I work hand to mouth as with four kids it works out that way . One is in placement for very bad psycological problems and one at home has severe ADHD and our medical bills are triple what most households are. We had to save for about 45 days just to make the so called filing fees. PLease help we are on the edge of being homeless and another 350 a month to the IRS would put us there.

I contracted with JK Harris to help me with my tax issues, but they were a waste of time. In September 2008, a representative of JK Harris signed us up for possible tax relief. Since that time and $3000 later, JK Harris has done nothing for us. After numerous phone calls and e-mails(which I have copies), JK Harris requested power of attorney because they needed to make contact with the IRS agent assigned to our case. Since that time, nothing was done and I continued to request updates on our case. I was told that JK Harris had left messages with the IRS agent assigned to our case but have not gotten a return call from them. I then requested full documentation of our case file plus the name and phone number of the IRS agent. I never received any feedback on my request for information from Mrs Payne. After speaking with an tax attorney, he gracely contacted the local IRS to check on the status of our IRS issues. We were informed that they had no record of contact with JK Harris on my behalf. In addition, the IRS had us in the que but no one from the IRS was assigned to our account. In the meantime, JK representative continues to send out a computerize form stated our account will be suspended if we don't supply the information requested. Numerous times, I have requested from JK Harris on what information is needed. I have never gotten anything from them. In addition, we were mislead by our representative on the type of service that JK Harris provides. Per Mrs P, all JK Harris was going to do, was negotiate a payment arrangements. When asked why is has taken five months to get any action out of JK Harris, we were told it takes time. Five months and $3000.. received no help. read more hide
i met with the sales person promised me to get a good offer and compromise and took my card. from then on nothing happened. its been 5 months. so far i paid 400 down and 233 for two months. i decided to wait for results before i pay more. i afraid they did nothing to resolve anything with the IRS> they only made things worse. i got a bank levy, a lien on my credit and now the IRS wants to garnish my wages for not responding to their notices. I thought wow, nobody at jk harris called them? so the IRS is pretty mad at me and the whole time i thought i was being taken care of by my so called power of attorney. what a shame. i lost everything and jk harris has made everything worse. i wish i could get on a class action suit and at least stop them from playing all those nice commercials and get them to give my money back as well as pay off the IRS for false advertising. i owe 4k more than i did when i hired the jk harris. anybody out there that wants to help me? please let me know. im on a contract with jk harris that i have to fight now. i owe the IRS more penalties and interest now and instead of being able to do the right thing i have to take two steps back and fight everyone. no wonder AMERICA is in the hole we are in, nobody does the right thing. ive lost everything i own. i went from successful to destitute within a few years. nobody cares read more hide
I owed the irs 10K in back taxes. I en listed Jk Harris to proceed with an offer in comprimise this was in 2005.for the most part all i was asked for was the same info to be up dated every 3 months or so. granted i was on a payment plan. either way over a year went by before they even processed my back tax returnes that they were contracted to do.which held up the offer.while this was going on i started bankruptcy proceedings (ch130.so my offer was on hold untill it was discharged.no problem.after discharge theyinfomed me that i nolonger had an irs obligation.i confermed this with the IRS.

I had seen the ads on television stating they could help with my IRS problems. I contacted the company and an appointment was set to discuss my case. The representative, whom I was led to believe was an attorney, spent about 30 rushed minutes with me, after he was late by over an hour. He told me that they could help and that they needed $1838 in upfront fees to proceed. Because this was during the severe economic problems, I told the rep that I did not have the money at that time and that I would need a few months to save. The rep had me sign a few documents and promised me the money would not be deducted from my bank account until I came in a finalized the agreement. Man was I duped! Approximately 20 days later, while checking my bank account, I noticed they had debited me the FULL amount. I immediately started calling them with absolutely no results. No callbacks, nothing. I then disputed the charges with my bank. JK harris then responded to the dispute by stating that they were actively pursuing my case and that I had signed an agreement for JK harris to represent me. They did absolutely nothing for me, no services, no nothing, only took my money and never even contacted me. Finally, after I pused the issue, they agreed to refund me $55, out of over $1800.00. I have since learned that they were orderd to pay consumer $1.5 million in a settlement for deceptive tactics and the attorney I met with was actually a salesman. I would love to join a class action lawsuit against this company that preys on vulnerable people that are just trying to get their IRS problems resolved. Shame on them! read more hide
We received a letter date 6/5/2008 explaining we won $3,600 in class action suit against JK Harris Tax Consultants. To date we have not received any corrspondence or money regarding this law suit. We have written several letters and called, but the number is disconnected. I also called the Courts in MN but they had no answer for us. Because JK Harris Tax Consultant cheated us out our money and they are still in business, we should be paid. We are in need of our money, Calvin is now retired, sick and needs medical care, we can't afford. Please let us know if you can help us. read more hide
It Seems that my story is much like everyone else's. Back in 2005 I ask them to help me with my debt. After paying them the start-up costs I never heard from them again. I called about 6 months later to find out what was going on and I was passed around to a few different people. I decided to cancel my account after getting very frustrated. I sent them the neccisary letter and thought I was done. NOT SO, a few months later I get a bill from them and I called to ask what that was for and they said they never recieved my letter. I wrote a second letter and moved away from my home at that time but left the correct forwarding address. Now after 3 years I'm getting a collection notice from their collection agency! Not only did I lose the money I paid them, but I was still in debt way over my head and now I've got a collection agency after me, continuing to ruin my credit! read more hide

We hired JK Harris to help us with tax issues we were having. We paid them 3200 and at the end of everything they told us that they were unable to help us. We were told that we would be issued a partial refund within 90 to 120 days. Well guess what of course nothing. When you call all you get is the run around and rude represtatives. You ask to speak with someone above them and they say there is no one else youc an talk to. I think that we should all join forces in a class action lawsuit! Got a better deal dealing with the IRS ourselves!!!!! Would love to be contacted by an attorney regarding this matter!!!! read more hide
i contracted with j.k. harris for a tax settlement, what they told me they could do, was not accurate. I paid them 1200 dollars. september the 10th, 2008, they agreed to return appx. 700 dollars too me. they simply will not return it after agreeing to. I call, they refer me to other people and when i e mail they simply go around the subject. It is a large ripoff. read more hide
I owed $11, 000 in taxes. I saw a commercial for JK Harris made an appt, and was told they could help me. They said they would be able to get my taxes reduced, probably by half. So I signed the contract! $1700 and a year later, they reduced my taxes by $100.00 yes, just $100.00. I could have paid the money I paid them to the IRS. instead I racked up more penalties and interest for another year and got nothing but a payment plan. They did absolutely nothing for me but take my money and get me further in debt. When I complained to them, they just inform me that my contract doesn't guarantee they will do anything. I got totally scammed by these people, and feel there isn't anything I can do about it. I am out the $1700.00 fee I paid JK Harris, with no results at all. I am several thousand dollars deeper in debt with the IRS now, racking up penalties and interest for the past year, while JK Harris took my money and wasted my time. read more hide
Due to loss in business in July 2006, we entrusted J K Harris with Power of Attorney to settle our taxs [personal and business] Their fee has been paid, they got an agreement on our personal taxes but not on business taxes.

I have to call them [ TWO CASE WORKERS LATER] to get to talk to anyone. reason given: CANNOT GET AN APPOINTMENT WITH AN IRS MAN - TOO MANY PEOPLE IN LINE ON THE BUSINESS SIDE OF TAXES.

I observed a TV commercial during the month of August, 2008 about JK Harris and Company stating they could people with their tax debt owed to IRS. I called them and made an appt. for August 26Th, 2008. I met with Jeanine B, consultant with JK Harris and Co. I signed an agreement for them to at least to represent me with IRS and obtain an installment agreement. I already had an installment agreement with the state of Missouri. Jk Harris stated that I had too much in real estate assets to get a reduction in taxes owed. I paid them $1850 down and agreed to $211 per month which would be an direct charge payment on my Visa debit card each month starting Nov.1st,2008 for the balance of total charges of $3700. I was to supply them with various personal and income data of which I sent to their South Carolina office within the next 30 days. Proir to my visit with JK Harris I had made contact with IRS during August. A representative informed me about an agreement which I could pay them $25,000 each time to avoid any penalties. Because my debt at that time was $66,000 and did not have that kind of funds available I felt pressured to seek JK Harris's help. IRS never told me about any monthly installment agreement. I already had obtained an istallment agreement with the state of Missouri for $390 per month. Thus, I concluded there were no similiar installment agreements from IRS. I supplied JK Haris with quite a bit of information on me to work my case. I found they did receive my mailed info in month of September. I didn't hear anything during October from Jk Harris. I did recieve from IRS during October notices of intent to lien and levy mailed out to me Oct.5th,2008. I contacted JK Harris and they requested I send these notices to their South Carolina office. I did and they informed me they would follow-up with IRS. Meanwhile Jk Harris on Nov.1st,2008 did get paid directly from my Visa account the agreed upon $211 payment but they also sent me a bill for $211 later that same month to be paid to c/o Professional Fee Financing Associates who handles their payment accounts. I called JK Harris about this double payments and they directed me to Professional Fee who resolved the matter by allowing that payment I paid via the mailed payment to be used for December's payment and they would skip their direct charge to my account for this month and it pick up on the January payment. JK Harris sent to me around December 5th,2008 a installment agreement letter to be sent by me to IRS of $322 per month along with setting up my account a fee charge. The letter stated I needed to submit this payment by December 28th,2008. I sent this letter in on time but Jamnuary 5th,2009 I received another letter from IRS stating they were to issue a lien and also a levy on my social security benefits and I had 30 days to request a hearing otherwise. I contacted Sherri Black of JK Harris and advised her of such and she asked me to send her these notices. I did and she informed me that someone with powers of attorneys in her company was on my case. Prior to this I had received several notices from JK Harris stating they were in need of certain documents in my file. While on the phone with Sherri B I insisted those documents were included in the original package I had sent to her. She went thru her file and did indeed verify she had the needed information. Also, I received duplicate letters from Sherri B of JK Harris seeking/requesting again documentation they needed to process my case. These letters came after january 14th,2009. Again, I was able to show them they indeed have all my paperwork of which they realized in error they did have them. At this time I expressed to Sherri B urgency on my part needing someone from JK Harris to follow-up on the IRS liens and levues and I inquired about the progress of my case. I told her that IRS had informed me that a case worker had been assigned my case. She had no knowledge of such. She asked me to obtain the phone number and address of that IRS case worker. I did supply that to her. As of Febuary 2nd,2009 no one from JK Harris has provided IRS with information on me except for leaving a message once with my assigned IRS caseworker. I complained of this to Sherri B and she informed I am not allowed to contact directly JK Harris's powers of attorneys but I must restrict myself to contacting her. My assigned IRS worker did make a home visit with me and I supplied her with some of the same information I gave to JK Harris to provide with IRS. The IRS agent has tentatively reviewed my request for a installment agreement and will work with me directly on an arrangement and is willing to work with JK Harris's powers of attorney if they ever follow-up with her. IRS have their numbers and JK Harris has hers but all the paerwork and documentations that I've provided to JK Harris and the starting payment of $322 is unbeknown by JK Harris of who has received it. read more hide
Over 3 years ago I paid JK Harris to help with credit issues. A year later they closed that division. Of course I received no notice. They did however acknowledge the owed me a refund of $828. They claimed it would take up to 120 days to pay. That was in January of 2008. Repeated emails, even to JK Harris himself, are responded to the same exact way. These people are thieves. I paid the money I needed to pay. They did not perform their services and by their own measures owed me a refund. I don't know how they can be allowed to continue in business with all of these complaints. They have over $800 of my money that I could use to help pay for my son's college tuition. I never thought I would have to wait this long for money that belongs to ME. read more hide
JK Harris failed to deliver on their promise, and I believe strongly now that they engaged in deceptive marketing and advertising practices. JK Harris did not perform or attempt to perform any communication to the IRS as promised and advertised in the time needed. The IRS levied my wage. This was after multiple letters I received and immediately sent to JK Harris regarding the IRS's intent to levy notices, they did nothing. JK Harris is happy to take your money ($4500) and then sit on their hands. In the meantime the IRS will be adding interest and penalties to your account, as they did with me. Since I could not wait any longer, based on the fact the IRS was taken 90 percent of pay at this point, I was forced to contact the IRS directly, I found they were easier to deal with and more responsive the JK Harris was. I recommend that you nor anyone else use them. Try contacting the IRS directly, it will save you money and stress. I am out thousands of dollars and my employer was contacted by the IRS, which I was trying so hard to avoid. read more hide

In July 2008, I visited with a JK Harris & Company consultant, J. Sokoloff, in Kansas City, Missouri regarding my back taxes. Unfortunately, on July 29, 2008, I signed an agreement and paid them $300.00 as a down payment. After that initial payment the amount of $183.00 was to be deducted from my checking account every month until the balance of $1,800.00 was paid in full. I should have known something wasn't right because on November 13, 2008, the IRS withdrew $157.31 from my checking account plus my bank charged me $100.00 transaction fee and $35.00 for an overdraft fee (because I didn't anticipate this money coming from my account). I had already paid $183.00 on November 1, 2008, to JK Harris so by November 13, 2008, I had paid a total of $475.31 because JK Harris failed to do their job. Then I received a letter dated December 3, 2008, from Alliance One trying to collect a debt which turned out to be the taxes I owe to the state of Kansas. I forwarded this and additional information to Ms. Youngblood on December 23, 2008, and asked if I should contact the state of Kansas or should she do it since she was my case specialist. On January 13, 2009, I e-mailed Ms. Youngblood and informed her that I had not heard from her regarding the notice from Alliance One. On January 14, 2009, she e-mail me a Kansas Department of Revenue Power of attorney form to sign and return to her. She said that a representative will get in touch with the Kansas Department of Revenue and Alliance One. I called Alliance One today, February 2, 2009, and they have not received anything from JK Harris. I have yet to call the Kansas Department of Revenue but I can almost guarantee that they have not sent anything to them either. On Friday, January 30, 2009, my employer received a Notice of Levy on my wages from the Internal Revenue Service. I panicked and first called JK Harris. My case specialist, V. Youngblood, was unavailable. I asked if they knew when she would be available and they said that actually she was being transferred to another department and that I was being assigned to a different case specialist. I explained my situation and we went around and around and around. She flat out lied to me about everything. This forced me to call IRS. I asked if they had received any correspondence from JK Harris regarding my taxes and he said that the only correspondence they received was dated August 8, 2008. I looked back in my files and found the correspondence dated August 8 and all it was was an Account Transcript of the taxes I owed.....that's it. The only way I could get the levy lifted was to start a payment plan with the IRS, which I did. I immediately terminated my agreement with JK Harris & Company. I wish I would have done research on JK Harris before I decided to depend on them to help me with my taxes. I am going to fight to get my money back. Filing this consumer complaint is not the end of my fight! I guess the lesson I learned is that I got myself into this mess and I will get myself out of this mess! I was just getting deeper and deeper in debt.....first it was my divorce, then I lost my job, then I was diagnosed with breast cancer (in 2003) and I am still fighting the cancer today. I was just hoping to eliminate my taxes so that I could get a fresh start and concentrate of paying my medical bills. This has caused me additional stress, anger, and expenses and that's the last thing I need right now. Company's like JK Harris need to be put out of business! read more hide

I with my own admission of stupidity did not know how to go about filing taxes. Being young ,without children and fairly prosperous, it never struck me as important. I wasn't getting a return. As I became older I found myself surrounded by smarter and more influential people who finally convinced me that there was an importance to filing. I never meant to cheat anyone and being christian finally stepped forward to do the right thing. I was running a small buisness and kept excellent records. Everyone I know that did something similar had very little tax liability do to deductions . I was confident this could be resolved. I first met with a JK Harris assosiate in 2002. At that time I had been off work for almost 6 months do to a serious injury. Looking at another 4 months off, I had time for resolution. They took my money at the consultation and made me feel as though it was routine and no problem.3 months later ,I had heard from noone. I called and in my own way expressed disatisfaction. 2 weeks later I recieved all the 1099's I had ever been issued in the mail. I took this as there was action going on. I went back to work, starving and concentrating on the catch up. Winter came and I was given the opportunity to go to Florida. I took it . A large hurricane had just gone through and it took sevemonths to settle. In the mean time another hurricane came through destroying the storage facility where my records were stored . A year after I had been here ,I was offered a management position in the feild I had spent my life in. Finally salary,bonus,health insurance and lots of tax money withheld. When it came tax time I still had no resolution. It is now 2006. I called JK Hartris to find my status and they told me that my case was inactive and I went through the whole story of my taxes with them again. The basic jist was that I wanted to get back on the books ,straighten this mess out and fly straight . They sent me a contract to sign , which I did. I now think I have representation and someone to go to bat on my behalf, in my interest.2 more months went by so I called . At that time it was explained that I needed to send them some records that I had already explained to them, I do not have. They sent me some forms to fill out on a year by year basis with a copy of my 1099 for the said year. I filled them out to the best of my ability, being conservative. I owe the government money . I'm not a cheat and I have little to no documentation. I sent them back and low and behold 3 weeks later I recieved those years of prepared taxes to send the IRS. I found 2 of them to have ommitted major deductions I had submitted so I called them. I feel as though I was talking to some teenager because as we went through it she saw that I was right and laughed it off. Just my life ya know. She made the corrections and promptly sent them to me. I sent them on to the IRS.I waited until the IRS started sending me nasty letters and 9 months had passed so I called JK Harris again. I was told that my case was inactive. I hit the roof . "what do you mean inactive?" I was told the lady that was handling my case was no longer there and my files had been left in the wrong department. Just the kind of excuse someone would like to hear about their taxes .Keep in mind that I have been sending them $270 a month this whole time. Finally I was reassigned yet another case worker. I asked her what was going on. She went through the next step. In my anxiety I told her that I would be calling the next day and I want answers. She asked answers about what. I want to know how much I owe, How we proceed , an outline of a payment plan and when we plan to finish this. I was then informed that I had only contracted them to prepare my taxes. I went ballistic. Noone would pay $3200 to only have their taxes prepared. There are H&R Blocks on every corner. For that money , I could have had a local tax attorney prepare them. I argued the piont. My understanding was that this is a tax relief service. Who would prepare and send in their back taxes without a plan of resolution? Apparently me as she argued back. I hung up. I called back the next day and demanded to speak to a manager of the complaint department. I told her the same thing I got the same trained responses. I felt like I was dealing with some teenagers laughing at me on the other end. She added information though. If I want JK Harris to represent me at the meeting with the IRS I would just need to call for a consultation and we then could discuss the terms and prices for those services. I flipped. I ended the conversation by saying that she and her company are a bunch of incompitent liars and when I am done with my tax deal, I will be hiring a compitent attorney to sue them for misrepresentation. I now find that I owe the IRS $26,000 with the forms filed by them. Up until my dealings with JK Harris, I was not even on the radar with them. Now I get 5 nasty letters a week. I did stop pay JK Harris from getting anymore money from my accounts. Let them report it to the credit burreau. Try to get a home lone with the IRS chasing you. Something that never would have happened without their involvement. These people are not professionals. If there is a license for this buisness, theirs should be pulled. If there is not a license, there should be. I have read several of thes complaints and quite a few people said what I have been thinking. There needs to be a class action suit against these thieving liars. There is no telling how many trusting , in need of help peoples lives these criminals have screwed with.

I signed up on Oct. 15 2008 owing $40,000. I was told about a former IRS Director employed by them, and that based on the interviewers experience my case would be settled for 10%. He also had me sign Powers that would have the IRS send all notices to them, or at least copies - I dont recall which. I was told Harris would negotiate for me and i should not contact IRS. I just received a Notice of Levy, I now owe $45,000, NOT A PENNY WAS WAIVED BY THE IRS, and I just called them and was told JK HARRIS HAS NOT COMMUNICATED WITH THEM SINCE DEC. 11 WHEN THEY REQUESTED A TRANSCRIPT. Now the IRS thinks I have ignored previous letters from them since i thought Harris was working on it! These guys must be sued...they are in a business so consumer sensative in reagrd to their reputation and integrity they are sitting ducks if this comes to light. Can someone help...please! If my wife finds out I owe this much, and liens are placed on our assets, my marriage is over. I cant sleep, i am a nervous wreck. read more hide
I met with an account manager in Myrtle Beach, SC - Spring of 2008 who assured me that J.K. Harris could have the penalties and interest abated. I then received a call from Ms. Wright who told me I was not eligible for any abatements - of course I had already paid $5,250. In October, I signed a release form and was promised a refund of $1,750 because J.K. Harris had not even filed a form. I have yet to see the refund and PRO - the individual who responds to my emails without any identification - says they can not say when I might receive my money. These people are nothing but crooks praying on people who need help. There needs to be something done to shut these illicit operators down. Having trouble with the IRS is terrible - being ripped off by J.K. Harris just adds insult to injury! I am working with the IRS directly now as well as the State of NC - both of whom told me J.K. Harris was the worst firm in this business - by far. So far, I am out $5,250 and my tax penalties and interest continue to mount. read more hide

I contracted with JK HARRIS & ASSOCIATES through their local rep, C. Given, to obtain an IRS MASTERFILE on my income for the years 2003, 2004, 2005 & 2006 and to prepare my taxes and mediate a settlement with the IRS for pennies on the dollar for the back taxes that I owed. I paid $500 in cash and agreed to a payment of $80 a month for 10 months to pay off the balance of $800 to be taken directly from my checking account. When I received the first debit notice on my bank account, I found out that they were going to debit my account for $110, $30 more a month than was agreed on. I called C. Given and threatened to close out my bank account if he did not change the debit amount back to the $80 that we had agrred on. They did get the debit amount straightened out and then I saw that they were charging me a $10 processing fee each month that I was not told about. When I finally received my taxes back, I called and tried to contact Chris to find out if he was going to help me before I mailed the returns to the IRS. He would not return my calls and when I finally called the main office, I was told that I had only paid to have my taxes prepared and if I wanted JK HARRIS to mediate with the IRS on my behalf, I would have to come back in and sign a new contract for those services. The lady told me that paying $800 to have my taxes prepared for 4 years was a bargain. I tried to tell her that I had paid a heck of a lot more than $800 to them but she didn't want to hear it. I'm paying 18% interest and I've made 13 payments of $80 totalling $1040 and I've got at least 4 more payments to pay before I have [this] paid off. They did not help me settle my debt with the IRS for pennies on the dollar and I had to spend my vacation days at the IRS office trying to work out a payment agreement so they would not attach my bank account. They actually cost me an extra year's worth of penalties and interest on my taxes that added a couple of thousand dollars to my tax debt. They lied and their TV commercials are a joke. If they had to pay restitution, it should have been distributed to the clients they ripped off, not a bunch of attorneys or the state read more hide
J K's consultant told me my tax debt would become reduced by approx. 60 - 70 % and that i would be able to make monthly payments that would start the very next month , this started in december 07, i paid him over $7,000.00 to straighten out my money problems with the irs and that i would be contacted by the main office to do more work like tax defferals in the stock market and business solutitions that would put me in a write off tax bracket where i would keep money instead of paying all kind of tax. i went home and 3 months went by and my bank account was being deducted $250.00 @ month and they did nothing , the irs wrote to me and told me that if i had not start paying they would start siezing my property , i wrote them begging there forgiveness and told them about this deal i made with these tax profesionels , i figured at that point that i was being ripped off by a major company scheme. i proceededd to call J K arris daily to stop all the nothing they were doing and to get my money back so i could give that money to the irs. it took 3 months to stop everything and they came up with a settlement agreement of aproximitly 50% for the 3 different forms i signed ,, this would give be back about 3500 dollars , well to get my money i signed it ,, now comes the better part , first they told me there was a different form i needed to sign and fax back , so they took another 3 months to get all 3 forms to me , the refunds as they callled it was split into 3 catogories , the first payment i recieved was in july , 6 months after this all started , then the second came in july , and the third release form came in august the 13th 2008 ,, this refund has NOT reached me yet , of course this is the larger of the 3.. not to bad for a company to profit on tens of thousands of people that they are doing nothing for , i paid over 7 grand and if i get the rest of this settlement agreement i will get almost half back ,, they profit over $3,500 just for making an appointment !!! read more hide

Signed with JKHarris in July of 200, July in 2008 I had to personally file my OIC, I've worked with 2 reps, 2 managers and I still had to do this myself. I believe I'm working with the same person, only they changed their name. Fortunately, I have email confirmations from JKHariss and have proof of their neglegence. I have been deailing with the IRS myself and will have my final response within the 45 days. JKHarris told me it would be 1 year, although here it is January 2009, it took me working with the IRS and providing them with all the information they needed that this is finally coming to a resolution and it only took 45 days from the time I took it over. I paid JKH over $3500, my taxes at the time were only $16 I am now looking at $26 due to the fact that they prolonged the project. It makes me sick to read how everyone got them to help like I did and I'm not alone. I would hope that someone out their is willing to do a class action suit again JKH. When you continue to read the complaints against them which is well over 4200 and it's all the same. They need to be stopped. They need to repay everyone back with interest. The people that I dealed with their (in which I've read a few others have used the same person) Rene & Lakisha, I believe them to be one in the same. I have over 188 documented emails from both representatives and they totally contradict themselves as well as prove they did absolutely nothing and prove that I did it all myself. JKH called the IRS on my behalf on January 5th of 2009, what happened with the last 1 1/2, no one knows, they had me sign 7 Power of Attorneys during that 1 1/2. I plan to sue them. I plan to follow through with making them pay for all the hardship they added to my already pending irs problems. I am under the care of a physcian for stress/depression due to the irs pending problems I have. My taxes nearly doubled in the 1 1/2 that JKH took over. read more hide
I met with consulants from JK Harris in April 0f 2008. (Travis and his Supervisor) I was told that it was 99% chance that he they could reduce my taxes to at least $10,000 from $80,00. I prepared all of the paperwork they asked for and supplied them to the company. My representative's name is Rene. The first offer she sent us was incorrect. I found an error wherein she had not submitted all of the information. When I told her she said that the figures would change if she entered the corrected information. Well she reworked the paper work and sent me another offer. This offer was much more than I had been told that it would be. I could not afford this offer. Finally she sent another offfer and I submitted it to the IRS. They rejected it. I have tried with no success to speak with her Supervisor. When I e-mail her it always takes several days to get a boggus answer. I would not advise anyone to use this company. I have lost close to $4500 on this scheme. I am 64 years old and have been trying to get this debt resolved with the IRS for more than 5 years. I keep getting the run around with them so I thought I would if I tried this company I could finally get some results.WRONG! Because of the situation I am in I cannot get credit or get a decent rate on my mortagage. I would love to get some assistance, but at this point I cannot afford to. read more hide

I went to JK Harris office in Lorain in May 2006. I paid them $1500.00 up front to straighten up a IRS claim. JK Harris. They completed the taxes for me to file. They set up automated deductions to my credit card monthly. I took out a loan to pay the balance so my credit card wouldn't be effected. I have had nothing but the same run around as everyone else. Refusal to let you speak with someone in upper management. Countless request to send the same information. Either they didn't receive it or the information is out dated. I finally contact IRS myself and is working with them to correct. In the meantime, I will be contacting the Better Business Bureau about the way JK Harris is ripping the consumer off. This has caused continous loss of sleep. Fear of losing my home. read more hide
My wife & I went to JK Harris in Ocala, Fl. The person there told us we will only have to pat a fraction of the amount we owe to the IRS. Since then JKHarris has done very little to keep there agreement to help us with our tax problem. We've called seveial times without a responce from them. They keep telling us they will call us back. The IRS & JKHarris keeps asking us for more information about out income & financial payments. As far as my wife & I know JKHarris has not contacted IRS (as per IRS telling us) IRS keeps sending us letters for the information. Since JKHarris has done nothing, we sent the forms to IRS. Since JKHarris has not keeped there side of the agreement we stopped paying them. In Oct IRS sent us a payment plain that is well above our income & payments. IRS states that we will make $194,172,99 this year. And we could afford to pay $1,499.00 each month. I receive SSI of $1,658.00 per month. We called JKHarris about this. JKHarris said to talk to the finance co about reducie our payments in half. The finance co did so. Buy they tell us that we must not be more then 60 days past due. JKHarris said if we just make one payment they will continue helping us again. Thay say we have to make two payments. When we called JKHarris back, they said Professional Fee was incorrect. One payment is enough. We are now at an impasse with them. We are just starting to keep up with our financial problems. Since JKHarris & the finance co has agreed to have cut the payments in half the finance co should tell JKHarris to start helping us again. JKHarris tells us one payment is enough but thr finance co says it's not. Where do we go from here. JK Harris now tells us that we have to pay the IRS $150.00 each mo. That is the same amount we were told by the IRS to pay them a year ago. Is this how JK Harris does business? We pay them, they do not have us pay a fraction or what we owe the IRS, plus we still have to pay the IRS the full amount. Do we need help? Let alone we have a small income the IRS says we will make (according to our estimated income) 150,000.00+ this year. I receive $1600 from SS plus pay from a part time job. That's less then 25,000 this year, read more hide
I hired J.K. Harris in April of 2008 for close to $5,000 to help with a few years of back taxes. On May 31st I found out that my paycheck was garnished by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. I quickly called J.K. Harris only to be told that all of my paperwork was not submitted properly. My question to them was why did it take you a month to tell me. They had no answer! I then asked them if they could contact the Commonwealth of Mass to let them know we are working to get a payment plan to pay this amount back. I called every day for over a week to have an abatement letter created. Again this went unanswered by J.K. Harris! In August 2008 I had a payment agreement with both the IRS and Commonwealth, and my paycheck continued to be garnished till mid September. For three months I asked J.K. Harris for the abatement letter and got NOTHING!!! I received a letter at the end of September 2008 that a new rep was handling the penalties and interest on both the IRS and Commonwealth. I have called more times than I can remember and no update or information can be given by this rep! DO NOT USE J.K. HARRIS!!!!! Lost $5,000 to hire this bogus company, garnished paychecks for 3 months totaling over $3,800 read more hide
j k harris promised for a fee which they collected from monthly drafts form by checking account to contact all parties i owed money to arrange for settlements and make arrangements for me to pay since 6/2005 for total amount of 1090.00. They told me to stop making payments. they would take care of everything - all they did was ask for 2 credit reports which i already had, and take money, when i called i got one rep afer another stating they was new to case and had to start over because the previous person couldnt locate their records, and nothing came to me, call again time after time with different rep and they still did nothing. After years of frustration ask for money back and all they stated they give me back was about 438.00, that's been since beginning of 2008 and 11 months has passed and still no check as been sent - now when i call the phone line is busy, i even email them and still no answer. Because of J K Harris making my situtation is worst i cannot get the job i want due to credit, cannot buy home because of credit, even rent a decent apartment, cannot get car loan, or credit card with a good discount rate, plus i am ashamed i could have been taken by these people, my blood pressure gone up and sometimes i can't sleep, i can't believe our government would continue to let these type of practices to go on this country where, crooked law firms get away stuff like this, j k harris owner's should pay all monies they defrauded people, and go to jail. read more hide
I went to JK Harris office in San Antonio, Tx for help in October 2007 with an IRS matter. The intake specialist that I spoke with gathered all my information, and he said, that they could help me settle with the IRS for less than $600. He said, that in order for JK Harris to help me I had to agree to pay $500 down payment and $283 a month for 10 months starting November 2007 and supposely ending in August 2008. Well, in Juen I received a letter from their loan agency informing me of their finance charges for JK Harris, and I immediately call JK Harris and questioned that. JK Harris specialist informed me that they had a loan department that finance for them and as a client we are responsable for paying the interest rates and therefore, my ten months was no longer ten months I had to make my final payment of $243 in September 2008. Well, going back to the beginning of the year JK Harris kept sending my husband papers to fill out, which we completed and dropped off at their local office. We then got more letters stating that they never received or documents so I again submitted the documents requested. After all that they sent us my husband tax forms completed for the years he had already paid someone else to file, so again I was on the phone with JK Harris asking why they were filing my husband's information if I wasn't married to him at the time that I had the issue with IRS and he had already filed his taxes for those years. I never heard back from them and in June of 2008 I get a letter from the IRS with a final notice to intent to take posseession of my properties. My family had to struggle for over 11 months to pay for JK Harris service. As it stands we will still be struggling because I had to come to agreement with the IRS to settle the matter, before they continued to take possession of what little we owned. My family lives off a tight budget and after paying all the bills we have close to $200 left a month and that is for food, but now we will once again have to struggle because JK Harris failed us. The IRS kept my returns for 2006 & 2007, and all this was due to a company that I did work for and they filed the wrong return. read more hide

I, myself is a victim too. I contacted JK Harris and Company in June to help me with my installment payment and possibly eliminate fees and interests associated with the balance I owed. The Rep that I met with said he could reduce my payment down to half and eliminate fees and interests. So I signed the contract and he transferred my case to a specialist in their head office. I could never reach him after that. This so claimed specialist contacted me and seemed clueless about my case, I almost had to explain to her what I requested to them every time i spoke with her on the phone. She also told me that interests and fees were not going to be eliminated which is the opposite of what was told me at the initial meeting. After I found this contradiction I became weary about the company. I started think about getting a refund. So i wrote them a refund letter and it took them longer than the 45 business days they claimed, and the letter basically claimed that they did 80% of what was being agreed to on the contract which means they are going to take 80% of the 1500 dollars that I paid. In reality they had done nothing for me, and what they claimed they could do in the first place, I later found out I can do myself over the phone through an automated phone service. I paid my fee with a credit card, and I am currently a full time student so it is difficult for me to have to make that payment especially when there was no service done for me in anyway that was beneficial. read more hide
On October 3, 2007, I signed a contract with JK Harris to negotiate a settlement with the IRS. I agreed for JK Harris to withdraw $318.00 per month from my checking account for one year in exchange for their services. I also paid them a down payment of $500.00 the date that I signed the contract. They requested an enormous amount of financial information from me which included copies of all debts and assets for a 3 month period of time. I kept calling them and they told me they were working on the account. In August 2008, I demanded they complete their responsibilities under the contract. Their response was they now needed ALL OF THE SAME FINANCIAL INFORMATION AGAIN AS THE INFORMATION I HAD GIVEN THEM WAS OUTDATED. I complied and sent this packet of information to them. I again contacted them telling them the IRS was going to place a lien on me as of November 14, 2008 unless payment arrangements were made. On November 7, 2008, I received a return call from a different agent, Michelle Bryant, telling me she had a note saying she needed to contact me or the IRS on November 14, 2008. I asked her where Cynthia was and explained the November 14, 2008 date was the deadline for the IRS lien. She stated Cynthia no longer worked for JK Harris and she did not see any documents in my file. Later that day she left a voice mail message for me to send once again (this is the third time) ALL OF THE SAME FINANCIAL INFORMATION THAT HAD BEEN SENT TO JK HARRIS TWICE BEFORE. By now, my contract was paid in full to JK Harris and I could not provide her with all of the debt and asset information for the last 3 months in time for her to contact and prevent me from having a lien placed on my account. I am a Public Defender working for the State of Florida and my annual salary is only $42,000. I went to law school at the age of 50 and now owe student loans over $160,000. I will be 68 years of age this December and all of any extra money I could obtain last year was spent paying JK Harris. If a lien is placed on my account I may lose my job with the State of Florida and could also lose my license to practice law. I informed JK Harris of this and their response was to continue stalling me by asking for the same documents over and over. They refuse to allow me to speak to anyone in authority. When I send emails to anyone in authority, they respond by having the same entry level person contact me. It has been over a year since I signed a contract with JK Harris for their services and my obligation for payment to them is complete. To date, they have made no effort to fulfill their obligation to me. They are in Breach of Contract by failing to contact and negotiate on my behalf with the IRS. I believe the Federal Government should get involved and investigate the practices of JK Harris; especially since they practice across state lines. read more hide
I paid JK Harris $2,400 up front in full to help me with an IRS Notice to Levy in February 2008. As it turns out, I was simply late on a payment plan with the IRS. I was able to catch up on payments and no action was needed on my behalf from JK Harris. Therefore, I requested a partial refund. On May 13, 2008, I was informed by JK Harris that I would receive a refund of approx. $1,600. I signed and sent a "Receipt and General Release" on May 28, 2008, which was received and forwarded to JK Harris' Accounting Dept. for processing on June 11, 2008. The signed agreement stated that I would receive my refund in 90-120 days. It has been almost 150 days now and I have not received my refund. Numerous requests to JK Harris have come up empty. JK Harris refuses to give me any information about the status of my refund. The standard form response I have received multiple times is that my refund is "subject to rescheduling until such a time as our Accounting Department confirms the printing and transmission of an individual check. I have also called their offices but I always get an answering machine and when I leave a message, I am told again that there is no information available about my refund. I have begged JK Harris for more information because of my signed agreement, as well as letting them know that this is causing me great hardship. But I have wasted my time and still cannot get any information about my refund. The latest response I received on Oct. 28, 2008 was "We are currently working to process the delayed refund checks as quickly as we can, but we are temporarily unable to accurately project check dates beyond the current week due to the delays. We are hopeful that these delays will be cleared up soon, but until that time, any additional information regarding this check date would be purely speculative." I keep getting the run-around and there is no end in sight. I have no idea if I ever will actually receive my refund. JK Harris is free to delay my refund indefinitely. I do not think that continuing to write or call them will help. They keep giving me form responses that tell me nothing. I am very desperate and at the end of my rope. read more hide

We were naive. We met with a JK Harris representative who promptly signed us up and took a $1000 deposit from us. He talked us into paying them $330 per month for one year. We were desparate and agreed. He assured us that we qualified and actually told us to stop paying any bills other than those needed to survive, (ie: power, rent, phone). We had several medical bills outstanding but did as we were told and stopped paying them. Desparation certainly does make us fools doesn't it? Even as I write this I can't believe I didn't see this coming. We spent weeks gathering information for them. We mailed it off thinking that this would all be over soon. About two months later, we received a letter stating that they were still waiting for our information. We mailed it again; certified this time. A few months later we received another letter that they had not received our information. Finally, after faxing them the copy of the signature of the person that had signed for our last package, they admitted they did receive it and we received our tax forms in the mail. We were told to sign them and take them our local IRS offices. Up to this point, it was only the Federal that had contacted us, but we did as we were told and filed with both the Federal and State. About a month later, letters began arriving from the State IRS. We were receiving them daily. The fines and penalties doubling the tax that we owed. We made several calls to JK Harris and just like everyone else, were told that our case manager had been switched. We sent all of this State paperwork to the new case manager. Then to our surprise we received a phone call stating that we had not paid them to help us with our State taxes, only with the Federal. If we wanted help with the State, it was going to cost us more money. At that point, we knew we had been duped and requested a refund. After three emails and over a dozen phone calls, we finally received a letter stating that we would only receive half of what we had paid them and it would take 90-120 days for them to cut a check. We noticed some strange verbage in that letter which basically said that we were agreeing to not talk badly about them as a condition of them sending us a refund check. That one statement spoke volumes. We signed the paper and sent it certified the following day. We patiently waited the 120 days before we started calling and emailing. Every phone call was met with a machine and we left messages to please call us back. Almost a week later, we finally received a call. The woman on the phone said our paperwork was "in process" and she couldn't tell us when we would receive our check. When I started to remind her of their letter, she laughed at me and hung up. I started sending emails. I received a few responses with the same answer, "we don't know when you will receive your check, but thank you for your patience". Our patience has run out and we are now hoping to join some class action suit against them. We were under the impression that by signing that paper for our refund, that we were entering into an agreement or contract of sorts. We have done everything they asked of us and more, and they have done nothing. If we don't stand up and call them out as frauds, how many more people will they be able to rip off? The amount of complaints and money that they have in effect stolen, must count for something. Someone please help us. read more hide

After I made an appointment with this agency I could not google their address. No problem. I had forgotten the information I had written down so on the way to my I appointment I called 411 and asked for their phone number. They were not listed in my town. Then the operator looked under the toll free listings. They were not listed there either. So here is a big company that advertises on the news channel that has an address that doesn't come up on google and a phone number that is not listed. What kind of organization is this? I am so grateful I wasn't able to keep that first appointment. Fortunately I did not suffer any damages because this company rendered itself invisible to me. read more hide

We've paid this company $2000.00 four years ago and the problem was to help us settle with the IRS. We were in bankruptcy and they told us that they could make us pay while we were in bankruptcy and they would help us when we get out. We did and ask for their help. It's taken them over four years now and we are still being turned down with the offer of compromise. We have showing many times that we do not have the things they say we do. J.K.Harris knows this and have all the proof. We do not have the money. We believe in J.K.Harris and nothing is being done for us. We've had three other persons handling our files and the second person really mess us up. Their ads say they can help you, but we are not getting the help. When I call Angel to talk to her, she is always with other clients. I'm one too, I need her help too. I think this has gone on for far too long. Our money we paid them to help was for nothing. I think that we were forgotten about. Please if there is anyone to help us with this problem, we need help. Angel has the letter that we received on Oct.17,2008. I had to Fax it to her again, which cost us money again to send. I'm so afraid of what will be done to us. We just wanted to give the IRS a compromise that we could pay.

I met with an attorney who represented JK HARRIS & Company in Modesto, CA. After indicating to him that we were in tax trouble & were in a position that would have our wages severely garnished from the IRS & Franchise Tax Board Of California, he calmed me by telling me that they could have all of this stopped if I were to pay a substantial down payment & set up monthly payments to come directly out of our checking account. After our meeting, I submitted the requested information that they requested from the packet that was given to me at the meeting. This information was the tax organizer. After several days, I received a letter from the IRS indicating that JK HARRIS will no longer represent me as their client. I made several efforts to contact them & could never speak to a "real person". I never received any return phone calls from anyone from JKH after leaving several messages. It made me wonder if this whole company was a hoax & a complete SHAM. Shortly after that, I received a phone call from a representative from JKH indicating that they have not went forth on our account because they still have not received any of the requested documents that they needed. I faxed this information to them on the 2nd & 3rd time. Each time, they told me that they never received it. I then sent it to them via USPS twice & both times, they told me that they never received it. I verify with the representative that the address was accurate & sent again. Finally, I am convinced that they are not who they say they are & have no integrity whatsoever. I then stopped all payments to them from my bank. At that point, I was finally able to received several calls & letters from JKH requesting $810.00 & that our account was put on hold because it was delinquent due to non-payment. I spoke with a representative on 9-12-08 (Chris **) & told him that because we have not received anything from JK Harris, we are cancelling our account with them & wish to have any & all monies paid to them at this point refunded immediately. He told me that I could fax this request to their consumer litigations department & that they would refund me my money after I give them a brief reason of why we wish to cancel our account. Since then, I continue to receive letters from them indicating that they have our account on hold due to non-payment. My most recent letter from them (Walter Golden Accounting Specialist) dated 9-15-08 (THIRD & FINAL REQUEST) stated that they are placing our account in a Cancellation Pending Status & that if they do not receive our TAX ORGANIZER within 15 days, they will cancel our IRS Compliance Engagement Agreement & consider ALL monies received as earned & non-refundable. HA! How convenient! They insist on ignoring my request & pretend that they have never received anything from me when in fact they received everything from a down payment & all documents requested. This is not right! read more hide
Mr. ** supposed to consolidate my student loans and create one payment. However he convinced me that my current payments were going to the wrong place. He asked me to immediately close my account. When I did that, he just disappeared. He never returned my phone calls. He took from me $1000, devastated me with default loans status. A few months later, a guy name Hartwell called me telling me that he is the director of the company and that he knows what happened to me. He asked me to give him a power of attorney over the phone. I asked him to give me my money back, he said he cannot do it. I told him I do not trust his intentions and I do not understand why he wants me to give him a power of attorney. I said do not call me anymore if you do not want to return my money. I was financially and emotionally devastated. I could not fix my loan status for a very long time. I asked my school to help me with making new arrangements. read more hide

I've been trying for several years to clear my account with the IRS. I kept seeing tv ads for jk harris & decided to contact them. The first person I spoke with assured me I definitely qualified to submit an offer in compromise which they would prepare & submit for me for a fee which at the moment I do not remember (I seem to be having this problem so I write everything down). They took $500.00 upfront which was the amount I paid to the IRS each month and the balance was taken in payments out of my checking account by a billing service. I gathered all the information they required of me to prepare this offer & after several months of mailing & faxing the same documents over & over I finally received the offer which was $1501 on a bill of over $18,000. I called & was assured this was within the realm of acceptance for the IRS. The phone calls I made were seldom returned without me calling several times with the same question. Very frustrating for me as I was already frustrated with my predicament. Ms ** called me to say they had received a counter offer from the IRS which they never would provide a copy for my file. Never did know what that counter was as the representative was changed at that very time. This new one has spoken with me to tell me that they were preparing a new offer to present my new info which they kept saying they hadn't received from me but they finally found (letter from the dr stating that I had been diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease). Since I am employed full time as a caregiver I indicated that I don't know how much longer I can work & will then have only my Social Security ($973.00). At the time she called I asked her to come up with a more reasonable offer maybe 7 or 8,000 & she agreed they would. I have never received a call or a document regarding this new offer. I think this back in June 2008. Now I have received a notice from the IRS that they have placed a lien so it shows on my credit reports- that interest & penalties will continue. I own in joint tenancy which we had intended to sell & can't now so the IRS will not be able to take the proceeds. The IRS has determined that I am in a non collectible status. I do have copies of all my paperwork. I understand there is a class action suit I might be able to join. read more hide
ON 11/10/2006 I contacted J. K. Harris in reguards to my back taxes. They were going to help me by deleating a lot of what I owed in back taxes, so they said and for 5000 dollars they could handle it. The amount was quite a lot and I believed what they told me so I jumped for it. I paid J. K. Harris 1000 dollars down and borrowed the rest which totaled another 5100 dollars and I paid it off in five months. Here it is 09/29/2008 and still nothing has been taken care of. It seems as tho I have done all the work by getting information together and sending it in and calling two and three sometimes four time a week to see what is going on. The IRS levied my Soc. Sec. once and now they are about to do it again as things are not being taken care of as I was told it would be. Meanwhile my tax amount keeps increasing. So far nothing has been completed and J. K. Harris say they are working on things. What the out come will be I do not know but there is something wrong with this picture. Thank goodness I own nothing but I still have to live and it is on my retirement and Soc. Sec. as I am 65 years old. If I hear nothing soon I may have to go to the IRS my self and see if I can get help from on of their advocates which I shoukld have done at the first place. read more hide
I met with the rep from JK Harris in a pretend office, i.e. a room that use in an office in whatever town they are in at the time. He sat there and told me for $2,500 they would make all my back taxes go away. I was leary of his pitch, but was desperate and he was a smooth talker. I did some research and found out that you can get a Tax Advocate from the IRS to help you FOR FREE, so I went that route. JK Harris keeps calling and bothering me. I am going to turn them into the BBB, as well as other consumer agencies. Their service is nothing but a rip off. SO BEWARE of their smooth advertisements. They do NOTHING but make themselves richer. I suffer from emotional stress and they keep calling and bothering me. I want to find out where to turn them in so they will stop harrassing me on a daily basis. read more hide
I came to JK harris for help and the way it was explained to me, sounded so good that I could not refuse here to find out that the gentelman that I delt with, it was all a lie and I told a lot of friends good things about JK Harris, now I requested a refund and [they] told me could not refund me all of my money but sent me a letter to sign an said would return half, I still think that is still unfair then the bad part is that I called and they said that we donot know when we will cut you a check that is not a good way of doing buniess. I was never late on a pament and I kept my word and mayed all of my pament on time and with all respect I think that [they] should do the same. Thank you read more hide
On their promise they could indeed help us and after they received their payment in full, they did absolutely nothing.I would have to call for 3 or 4 days just to talk to someone and then the IRS agent told us they were not doing anything to help us but it was almost too late. We were told we were going to lose everything we had.We have to sell our things just to get by. My husband medical problems have also escalated.He is diabetic and because of the stress can't control his blood sugar. read more hide
Called JKH to help with taxes. Met at office in Boulder,Co. Started paying 100.00 a month back in April 7th, 2007 with a $500.00 down payment. Balance of $1500.00 total. In December 2007 I needed to pay the IRS so that I can close on my new house. I called JKH and told them what I had to do. They said they would send me a refund minus administrative costs. March 2008 I recieved this letter from JKH stating my refund. That they will be sending it in 90 to 120 days just sign this letter and send it back. Here it is Sept. 16th, 2008 and everytime I call they give me this number that goes directly to an answering machine. Help! read more hide
I originally signed up with JK Harris by meeting with a representative at a local office. He went over all my information and told me that he could get my IRS and FTB debts down to about $7500 each, which as considerably lower than what I owed. I was eager to get this resolved so I signed up with JK Harris. The fee was about $4800 to resolve the tax liability. I had some cash problems, but in July 2007 I paid JK Harris in full. On July 13, 2007 I received an e-mail from Melissa stating that they had received all my paperwork and a case specialist would be getting in touch with me. Upon speaking to the case specialist a week or so later, he told me he had all the information he needed and he was preparing my offer in compromise. At this time I owed approximately $120,000 to the IRS and approximately $19,000 to the FTB. (Taxes for 2002 thru 2004 had already been paid to the FTB by liens on my home and my bank accounts. JK Harris did nothing to stop the liens!) I did not receive the offer in compromise from the case specialist and when I called to follow up I was told that he was no longer in the department and the information he gave me was incorrect and I would be assigned a new case specialist. In September 2007 I received a new packet from JK Harris to provide all the information all over again because now the information was outdated. Latasha was assigned as my case specialist. After months of arguing with this person because she was treating me as though I was the enemy instead of treating me like she was there to help, I have been assigned another case specialist. Now its September 2008 and I finally received my offer in compromise. The offer is to pay the FTB $27,000 lump sum (on a $19,000 debt) and the IRS $21,000 lump sum or $48,000 in payments. My debt to the IRS with interest and penalties has grown to $213,000 because of JK Harris not taking care of this in a timely manner! In the last year I have lost my home, my job and am deep in debt. I have nothing left. Every time I see a JK Harris commercial, I want to throw up! This company should be put out of business for false advertising! I wish I would have read consumer complaints before I wasted my money! IRS debt has grown from approximately $120,000 to $213,000 with interest and penalties. read more hide
I paid JKHarris a substantial amount of money to handle my problem with the IRS. After a while JKHarris informed me that they could not do anything about my problem with the IRS. I asked for a refund of the money I paid them. They said they would refund $2062.00 of my money back. This was in March of 2008. They said it would take between 90 and 120 days. In july when the time was up they said it would not be until August 22nd. When August 22nd came, they claimed they could not refund my money at this time, and, that they had no idea when they would be able to return it. I am seeking your help in obtaining my refund from JKHarris tax consultants thank you read more hide
Well, I have a 3 months baby on my hand so not much time to describe what JK Harris company done to me. I wish I had seen this page prior to going to them. What I have to say can be said in a few words. JK Harris company/workers are a bunch of thieves, and instead of helping they make matters worse by taking your money and do then do nothing. I wish there was a way we could get them off the air. Every time I see their commercial it make me so angry that such mess has a right to do what they do to innocent hurting people. I am still in the same mess I was in, after they took me for my money and did not even make a phone call on my behalf. Someone need to do something to stop these thieves. read more hide
I contracted with JK Harris in 7/1/07. I was asked to provide all kinds of information and I did more than once. I was told that once I got compliant that would work out a payment plan with the IRS. I would call and ask when and they would need additional infromation. This went on for a year and out of the clear I was told I have a new Case Specialist and from the fist contact I found the new CS rude and very non-coperative. She wanted everything new. I sent her everything and then I ask her if the IRS would Levy my checking account. I was told as long as JK Harris was in contact with the IRS I had no problem with my bank account. My bank account was levied and I contact JK Harris and they start telling me that these is unusul and they would jump on this and try to get it lifted. The longer it went the less they wanted to talk about the levy and more talk about doing a settlement, Then they tell me that I need to send in new information and they will set up the payment plan. I still do not have a resolution to these problem and I am still sendilng in new ilnformation. The IRS levied my bank account for $13,000.00( I took a second job to save this) and my interest and penalty is $30,000 on taxes of $30,000. JK Harris has cost me between $10,000 and $30,000 dollas. They pray on people that are having a hard time and they do not deliver any services. read more hide
It's August 2008. Contacted JK Harris in Miami FL March 2007! Tax liability over $200,000. The rep here had no idea what she was doing. After about 2 hours we signed a contract and paid this company $5,500. This is what they did - after one year, Yes one year and 3 case specialists later, they sent correspondence saying that they determined that a payment plan should be set up. I could have done that myself. It's now August 2008 and I finally got to the SPEAK to the case specialist. She is reviewing the info. She will get back to us. Next year? Two phone calls and waiting and oh BTW do not call twice within a 48 hour period or your calls will be deleted. So disappointed. $5,500 to set up a payment program. We are out $5,500 and nothing to show except a letter from JK telling us to pay the IRS. read more hide
I filed with JK Harris in July of 2007. Nothing happened for a while. I was transferred from one case specialist to the next. I paid the entire $2500.00 they requested. After they reviewed my case, they offered me unreachable deals with the IRS. I asked for a refund and that was in February, 2008. It is August and I still havn't received my refund. Please help me get my refund. They transfer me to voice mail or they will tell me the refund will be sent in 120 days. The date is constantly pushed back from month to month. Please help. I've lost $2500.00 from JK Harris and they have not sent my refund of $1955.00 yet. read more hide
I, and my boyfriend,Mike, signed on with JKHarris in January 2008. They did nothing with our information for months (and in fact are just getting to starting Mike's offer in compromise-7 months later). My case has been transfered 3 times and was recently transfered again without my knowledge. I found out when I tried to email my case specialist and the mail was returned. In the meantime, I have faxed them notices regarding levys on my items for my boyofriend's tax liability. They did nothing with the information and even with consent from us to share information on our cases, my boyfriend's case specialist knew nothing of what was going on (he was just recently transfered again as well). I get different information from each person I talk to and nothing seems to get done. They have had our cases now for about 8 months and have not even prepared an offer in compromise even though I got them all my information almost immediatly. When we signed on we were told the WHOLE process from start to finish with the IRS takes about 8 months. Here we are 8 months later with nothing done on JKHarris's side. I left a message with the supervisor and SHE never even called me back. The same for Mike. No supervisor has ever called him back and he's called a few times. I am constantly calling them for information and am on hold for long periods of time. They rarely call me unless it is an emergency such as the IRS is going to seize my equipment in one week if I can't prove otherwise to stop them. Which, in fact, was not true. I had to call the tax advocate myself to find out what was really happening as my case specialist could not explain it to me and in fact admitted she didn't really understand it herself. When they do call me it is on the end of the day on Friday so I cannot have time to take care of anything till the following week. My case specialist kept telling me she was going to do things and nothing seems to get done. She tells me she will have someone call me who can explain things better to me but no one calls me back. She says she will absolutely have my offer done by Friday and it never is. Always some excuse. They do not have any lawyers in their firm for cases like mine. I feel as if they were completely misleading in their advertising and that I have done most of the work, they haven't done much. They have not lifted any burden from me and, in fact, things seem to be getting worse. I hired them to represent me and they really haven't come through on their end. They were incredibly misleading in their advertising and the ability to take on my case and my boyfriends. When talking to one person on a team she might tell you one thing and then a few minutes later talking to another she might tell you the opposite. For example, I called about the seizure of my excavator. My case specialist had previously said it was going to be seized by the IRS in one week. This woman, on my team, said the IRS doesn't really seize equipment and mine was not going to be seized. Upon my request for her to check into that she found out she was wrong. However, had I not pressed her to check I would have been misled that my equipment was safe. I filed a complaint with the better business bureau and they never responded. I am in jeopardy of losing my equipment, house and the IRS is levying my wages. I have 4 kids to support on my own. The IRS has put leins on everything I own and levied my bank account and wages. I'm not sure how much worse it could get but I'm sure it can. Now the IRS agent in Brattleboro, where I live, wants to meet with me personally to discuss paying my tax liability. I hired them to do this, not me. read more hide
My husband and I hired JK Harris for help with back taxes. Due to serious illness for the past few years, taxes fell behind. After seeing promising commercials on CNN, we felt they were a safe company. Our initial representative, David Stube, made us feel very comfortable. He reassured us that HE would be taking care of everything, how reachable he was, and offering that he would even meet with us in the evenings on his way in town from other appointments. We signed on the dotted line and scraped up $1000. Heck my tumor and treatment could wait, the IRS was calling. We were given a very vague packet and asked to fill this out. Two weeks later another packet arrived requiring more information and also a NEW CASE SPECIALIST located in South Carolina. I tried to call and always got voice mail or the "main voice mail". One a person answered and I think it was by mistake because when they heard my voice they seemed alarmed and quickly said, "hold please". I sent numerous emails to Tremaine Grate (case specialist) but no reply. I even gave deadlines and specific times. I then received a letter from the IRS, four months after I gave my 1K to them and they never even contacted the IRS on our behalf as promised. Yep, its the same old song and dance as listed in all of these other stories. I called the JK toll free number and left the most creative messages I could on every single voice mail that I could have access to. They even have an educational department. Wonder why, but I left them a message too. Funny, I started receiving calls in just a few minutes from folks is Charleston. (Not my local consultant or case specialist please note) I found out how to sever ties with this shady business. Email at : pro@jkharris.com also fax the email attention ROD to 877-. I hope this saves someone else the hours I spent on hold. I suffered economic loss of $1000 that I was supposed to use for health care as I have a tumor and other severe medical issues that need attention. We use our extra money for medical costs but need to work to pay hospital bills; and out of fear of having our wages levied turned to JK Harris in good faith. It has been extremely stressful and shameful. Had I not been sick I would have paid the IRS but unfortunately, I kind of would like to stick around a while. Thank you. Please stay away from this company if you are thinking its the way out, it is not. Hire an attorney that is local. JK Harris is just another way to more financial trouble and stress. read more hide
I thought I was doing the right when I contacted JK HARRIS to help me in Jan-2007. WRONG!!! This company should be put out of business.Two Thuosand One Hundred dollars later,nothing.My (case specialist)was a joke.She would not return my calls or e-mails.I would call and then be put on hold for maybe a hour or longer.Then I would hang up and call back only to told it was after hours. The story these people have amaze me.Lost paper work,not in at this time,everything you can think of.On February 26-2008 I made a request for a refund by e-mail.Two months later there response was that I payed $1542.80,should of known! Well then they said I would get a refund of $948.00,where is the other $1152.00 I payed?So I contacted them in June and they said my check whould be here by July 4.Called back July 8 they said my check would be here July 18.Again called July 22, this time a check whould be here by Sept 12.What a run around. I have names and dates of all the contacts with JK Harris.I know of at least 40 or more calls,most of the time to be put on hold.There is a lot more that I can and will say about this company.I'm just a hard working man that needed some help. read more hide
I hired JK Harris in June 2003 and paid them $2900.00 to settle tax problems I had with the IRS and NC Dept of Revenue. I was strung along until October 2005 I received garnisment letters from the NC Dept of Revenue. All they do is send you Power of Attorney forms and financial statement forms, the same forms the IRS would send you if you called them yourself! And that's the message....All JK Harris and all of those other so called "tax saviors" do is milk you out of your own hard earned money. Did you hear that? THEY DO NOTHING! YOU, THAT'S RIGHT, YOU CAN TAKE CARE OF THE PROBLEMS YOURSELF. The consequences I suffered are huge. My IRS tax debt is now over $60,000 and the NC Dept of Revenue has collected $15,000++ on an otiginal tax debt of approximately $9,000 and they still want another $8,000! JK Harris did nothing but did the hole deeper! read more hide
My husband and I had had some serious financial problems as well as family sickness. Our accountant told us about J. K. Harris who would work with the IRS on behalf of our back taxes. We met with a J. K. Harris rep. and he told us everything that would take place. (Right!) We paid about $2500 to this firm and they never did a thing! We told them that the IRS was about to levy on us and put a lien on our property. They said that they would get to that right away. Each time I called to see what had taken place, I was et with a new advocate and had to go through the same details again. We had over seven advocates during the three or four years we worked with the, but they did absolutely nothing. When I called them, it was either a new advocate or a recorded message. Of course noone ever returned my calls. The IRS levied on our social security to tune of almost 500.00 monthly and we still have not been abe to clear up backtaxes due to accumulating inteest and penalities. When we contacted the IRS and informed them that J. K. Harris was negotiating for us, they checked our files and said they had nothing in our records indicating that they had ever contacted them on our behalf! I could not believe that! When we received a letter inquiring if we would like to join in a class action suit against J.k.HARRIS, we IMMEDIATELY returned the letter indicating our desire to enter into the suit. This year we received a from the IRS stating that J.K.Harris had informd them hat they would no longer be representing us. How could this be when the IRS said there was nothing in our files from JKHarris indicating that they were ever working on our case! What is this! They never said anything about returning our money, although we have asked about a refund several times. We also have heard nothing else about the class action suit. We don't know what to do and we need our money in order to help pay our back taxes. . I have suffered mentally and this has caused a lot of stress on our marriage and also on our lives a we are in our sixties and seventies. Both of us have seen a severe rise in our blood pressure and I, as the wife, fear that I will not be able to continue assisting my daughter and her children, all of whom suffer with either a debilitating sickness or some kind of disability. If there is anybody who can help us, please contact us. read more hide

I hired jk harris to resolve my tax problem back in April 2007.I owed 11,800.00 I paid them upfront $2000.00 to act on my behalf and help resolve my IRS problems. I had an IRS levy on my bank account and was unable to do any banking. Both on personal and business levels. After a month both accounts still had levy's and nothing was resolved. I took matters in my own hands and negotiated on my own behalf.Things were resolved in 1 day! Jk Harris did absolutely nothing! the only thing they did was cash my deposit check. After that I requested a deposit refund of my $2000.00. The response I got it takes 90 to 120 days to investigate my request. Well after dozens of phone calls and pure frustration from incompetant employees. I finally received a waiver form in January 2008 entitling me to a $1500.00 refund. Apparently when you sign the power of attorney contract there's a 25% nonrefundable deposit fee charge. Anyway, and how surprising it takes another 120 days for your refund check to be issued. And charges should be brought up against them for misrepresentation charges. It's now July 20, 2008 Over a year since I hired them and more so requested my deposit refund. No Refund I keep calling And get put through to voice mail stating this is a long and tetius process which could take sometime. They can spend Millions of dollars every year on false T.V. ads but a refund check don't have the money. read more hide
We contacted J K Harris on 5/22/08 to help us resolve a tax issue. The consultant Tibor talked to us and told us they could get us a resolution in compromise for $1500 (we owe $62,000). We explicitly conveyed that we wanted to work with a local company so that we had access to a person one on one. He assured us they were local. He said their fee was $4000 flat no matter what they had to do. We told him we would have to take out a loan against a 401K in order to pay this. We also made it clear that once we took out that loan we couldn't get another one until it was paid back so if he thought it would be more than the $1500 to settle he should tell us before the loan was taken out. He assured us that it shouldn't go over that. He said we could post date a check for 30 days from then. We knew it may run a little over 30 days to get the money and advised him of that. He said that was ok, just to call them and let them know when they could cash the check but be sure to call before the check date. We agreed. The money did not clear our bank until 6/25 and we did call and advise them to hold the check until 6/26. They agreed and the money was taken out of our account exactly on that day. Within a week of speaking to Tibor we received a call from Lauren in Charleston, SC saying she was our account rep. and that she had file a power of attorney to deal with the IRS on our behalf. When asked why we had to deal with her when we were told we would have a local rep she told us that their main office in Charleston was the only place that handled these issues. She kind of poo pooed it when told that Tibor had told of it would be handled here. She said she would be sending out some forms for us to fill out regarding our financial situation and when she received them back she would be able to assess our situation better and move on from there. She said she would file a 90 day stay of collection so we wouldn't get garnished until we had the forms back to her. We never received any forms and when my husband called her again she said they had been sent out on 6/19. I sent her an email stating that we had never received them and could she please mail again or send to my email. I never got a response. My husband has sent her email after email and called to leave messages and never gets a response to either. Today, 7/17, he called and the receptionist told him their system was down and she couldn't transfer any calls. Ever since they cashed our check we have not been able to talk to them in any way. We are afraid they are just scamming us and are seriously thinking of getting an attorney. We are afraid that we have lost the $4000 that we paid. Also, that we have now exhausted our loan potential on the 401K account so can't borrow any more to pay another company to represent us or to pay any portion of the taxes due ($62,000). read more hide

We were victims of JK Harris before the class action lawsuit against them. We were told that both the federal and state taxes would be taken care of. After 2 years and $2500.00 later, nothing was completed by them. As a result, most of the work was done by ourselves. Because we couldn't find our receipts for total payment to them, we could only be in the class action suit for the $200.00 minimum that they said we paid.We did Offer in compromise ourselves and it was accepted for federal taxes. We still haven't settled with the state, thanks to them. Loss of $2500.00 and faith in doing business with people. read more hide
After reading over these reports of the exact problem with jk harris, I really feel sick at my stomach. The day after we gave that representative our 2,000.00 plus 250.00, I just had a bad feeling about him. He was very unprofessional, but I thought this was on TV during Fox News. It had to be legitimate. After a year and two months of trying to get my refund, I feel it is in the wind. Is there anything we can do? This is Fraud and in our faces. I really would like to see someone with power take on this company and all of us file our claims for refunds. We all have the proof. I'm looking for a hero out there.
I let JK Harris know that they missed an important deadline that IRS documents needed to be filed on. After I let them know, I dismissed or 'fired' them, they went ahead and withdrew money from my account on a day it was not authorized, causing havoc with my checking account. This company has poor communication and very non responsive. Because they debited my account on the wrong day I had a charge for unsufficent funds. This was AFTER they knew I didn't want their services for inaction. Also I had told my rep about the date the papers needed to be filed by and the deadline was missed.
in 1999 I called jk harris &company& setup payments of $2.500 over time we paid all of $2.500 for them to get offer of compromise. all we got was the run around and I forgive you. Thank You. I wood like to have a copy of my account so I can clame it on my taxes is that to much ask.
On numerous occations I gave them money to represent me and do my offering compromise. They kept my money and would not even call me and would not return any off my calls. I do not understand how this company can be allowed to take thousands of dollars fromn people and still advertise on tv.
It's been a number of years, almost 5 to be exact, that my issues with JK Harris began but a commercial on the television prompted me to do some research. My husband and I were attracted by JK Harris ads and sought out their help and were made promises that were never delivered. Our OIC offer was for about $750 based on about $7000 of back taxes. Obviously that wasn't an amount that was acceptable to the IRS. In fact, because of the shoddy job, lack of sufficient communication the result was that this company knew everything about my life, had all my personal information and then some, a bunch of my money, and led to my wages being attached. About two years ago, it could be more, I was contacted by an attorney, Seth from Hersch and Hersch, about a class action suit. I also supplied this man some information who then promised to call me back after he returned from his honeymoon, never got that call. Made a call myself that was never returned. Sometime last summer I received a class action application, filled it out, mailed it, and placed another call to him. There was mention that payouts would begin sometime after December 2007. Here it is, July '08. I have not received a call back from Seth or any reimbursement from this class action suit. So who is making money??? I'm not nearly as bitter as I used to be but it does cross my mind every now and again. It would have taken way more money that what we have and owed to fight this on our own, but once again it seems that we've been walked on once again. I'm still paying on those back taxes, and I suppose that what is left is really all the penalty and late charges. It's not difficult to see what difficulties a family suffers. There have been times of hardship and scraping by. Poor ratings in getting credit or high interests because of it.
Ihad back taxes problems and was looking for some tax consultation. I seen j.k harris on t.v. and gave them a call. they quoted me a number which was to good to be true and it was. stupid me i went for it and paid them $ 5000 and after a year of getting shuffled around and the paper work getting lost, no return calls on statis,i had enough.Icalled the I.R.S. and got ahold of someone with people skills not theses ive talked to before and he laughed at the amount j.k.harris quoted me and said there was no way uncle sam would agree to that so he gave me a real number. basicly the only thing they can do is drop the penalties and interest, that is the amount u must pay. Bottom line j.k.harris is a big ripoff, do not trust them. loss of $5000,pain and suffering, stress and uncle sam adding more penalties to the amount owed
I contacted JK Harris in November of 2007 due to contact I'd been having with the IRS for approximately 5 months. I knew I owed a big delinquent tax bill. I was desperate for relief and decided to contact JK Harris. Their contact told me they could help me. They gave me paperwork to fill out and send to their offices in South Carolina. It took me longer than I thought it would to round up all the information they requested. My wife and I are estranged, were at the time, and she possessed all the documentation they wanted. Although I told JK Harris I would take on our tax liability on my own, they required an information submission from my wife. I couldn't get mine together till my wife gave me hers due to the fact I needed some of the information she would be supplying. They also told me they needed me to submit both packets of information at the same time. The information was submitted to JK Harris in February '08. I called in April '08 to find out what the status was of my application for a payment plan. They asked me if I'd submitted my delinquent state tax returns yet. I was appalled at this question as I was never informed that these delinquent returns needed to be posted before JK Harris could prepare my application for a payment plan. I got the state returns filed. I then called in June '08 to see what the status was. I was told my case worker would need to check on some information and that she would call me back. She never did. In the past couple of days I received a notice of intent to levy from the IRS. I also received a notice from my employer that the IRS would be garnishing my wages commencing July 18, 2008. I called JK Harris to see what the status was of my application for a payment plan, and I was put on hold while the person on the phone (not my case worker) looked up some information. I was then told my case worker would need to look up some things and that she'd call me in two days. It's two days later, and the call hasn't come. She has one hour left in South Carolina to call me, and I'm not expecting any miracles. By the way, I have never been able to speak with my case worker. It's always some underling who has no idea of what's going on. I doubt my case worker does either. I decided to take matters into my own hands. I called the IRS today, July 2, 2008. I was on hold for about 15 minutes. I was greeted by a woman who was friendlier than others I'd spoken to at the IRS in the past. Maybe it was just my lucky day. She told me I could work out a payment plan on my own. I knew this all along, but JK Harris kept telling me to stick with them because they could get me a lower payment than I could negotiate on my own. The IRS lady took my information, asked me what I could pay, and I gave her a figure that I'd hoped JK Harris would be able to secure for me with their magical negotiating powers. The IRS lady told me my plan would most likely be approved and that the levy and garnishment would be lifted within about 10 days. This process took less than 40 minutes. I have suffered the loss of over $3000 I paid to JK Harris to submit my payment plan application. I have spent many hours filling out paperwork for JK Harris. I have lost sleep and have been stressed out over the fact I owe money to the IRS and no word on if or when an installment plan would be submitted or approved. There is one thing I can give JK Harris credit for. They do tell the truth when they say IRS problems won't just go away. They should heed their own words and do some of the work they say they're going to do. I will say that I paid for some tax services, and the man who has done the work for me, Tom, has been responsive and prompt in getting things done. Perhaps I have overpaid for this service, but Mr. has been the one ray of light that has shone through. The stuff JK Harris says they can do better for you is completely doable by an individual, at least in my case. I got my problem taken care of in 40 minutes. It took me hours to fill out paperwork for JK Harris, all with more stress than was necessary and to no avail. Live and learn.
In 2006 we contacted jk harris about tax problems because I was layed off and could not afford to back taxes. We submitted the paperwork they asked for, and after a few months they told us that our case worker had changed and we must resubmit the papers. We did, and after another period of no action, we were told the same thing again, and again. We finally contacted the IRS ourselves and found out that only the IRS can help us, and they did. We have set up a monthly payment. We were recently sent a letter form jk harris, telling us how great a job they did. We paid them $3000 and they did nothing but give us a runaround. They want us to tell our friends about them, so I am. I'm telling them if they are having problems with the IRS, call the IRS, NOT jk harris. We borrowed $3000 to apy them and are still paying the loan, for nothing
I contracted with this tax resolution company back on January 23, 2008 and agreement was to put me in a Non Collectible Status with IRS for back payroll taxes - 940's & 941's that were not paid as a result of my husband's neglect as the accountant of my business. I did not know how long they had gone unpaid until I had to file for bankruptcy in middle of 2006 and again in early 2007. To make it worse, there were quarters not even filed. My husband ran off with another woman in 2005 and left me accountable for his mistakes. Since I am the owner of the business that he did not pay the taxes on, I hold the responsiblity for paying them. He was keeping money from my company to fund his affair and neglecting his financial duties as CFO of my company. Getting back to JK Harris, it is policy of the IRS to not put me in a Non-Collectible status unless the business was officially closed and paperwork filled out, which it was not and JK Harris should have done their homework and known that rule before promising a Non-Collectibe Status. They have been absolutely no help in contacting or compromising with the IRS and I have been assigned numerous case specialists since going on board with them and then they tell me they can't do anything until some missing filings are taken care of. Again I struggled to get these taken care of right away and it has been 3 weeks and they still have not followed up with the IRS to see that they have received them. They should have also known that some of these filings were not done when they requested my master file from the IRS several months ago. Everytime I called them, they would take days to get back to me and were also asking for more paperwork. Today was the final straw with them because my bank accounts have been frozen and I am literally without cash in my pocket because they have not been doing what they say they will do. I called my case specialist 5 times or more in the last week and finally today she says she will call the IRS office about the levy. Well so much for that, because I called them myself and have a meeting Wednesday morning to work this out myself. JK Harris promised me a call back today and I never received it. I have had it with that scamming outfit and want something done about it and all my money refunded which was an inital $250 deposit and $118 taken every month from my bank account starting 3/15/08 thru 6/15/08. They charged me $1,400 ($250 was up front) and the remaining $1,150 is taken out in $118 installments every month until it is paid off. So far I am out $722 which I want a total refund on. PLEASE HELP!!!!! The economic damage is the further damage to my already poor credit. Now I have had my bank accounts, including my 18 year old sons account because my name is on it and he is an innocent party to this whole mess. The mental strain alone over the last several years and months is more than I can handle.
I made the unfortunate decision in 2006 to use JK Harris to resolve my tax problems. I met with a representitive, gave a down payment of $500.00 and had JK Harris's finance department automactically withdraw the rest of the $2500 plus interest ($331.00 per month) for a year. In this year I was assigned to 4 different case workers, all just as clueless as to my case as the last. The IRS started garnishing my wages and it took JK Harris's attorneys 2 pay periods (one month) to file the Power of Attorney to stop the garnishments. So, not only was I paying JK Harris every month, but the month of May 2006, I had ZERO money for my bills, as the IRS took half of my pay, JK Harris another portion and the rest to bills. I have tried to contact by phone and postal mail in regards to the standing on my OIC - and have yet to receive any type of response. Today, June 20, 2008, I received a letter in the mail from the IRS that JK Harris has revoked their Power of Attorney and are no longer representing me, no notification from JK Harris first, just a scary letter from the IRS. What now? Do I get a refund of the money I paid them to do NOTHING for me? Can the IRS attack my bank account now? JK Harris has only taken from me - now what do I do?
I hired JK Harris & Company in August of 2005 to represet me to negotiate a smaller payment with the Federal and State for my 2004 taxes. At the time I had been downsized out of my job of 18 1/2 years and was doing temporary work for very low pay and was barely making it. The representative (fast talking and pushy) that I saw convinced me that I would be crazy to try to do this without a tax attorney, so I signed on the dotted line. They took my money and gave me nothing in return. They charged me close to $3,000.00 and did nothing for it. I was charged $15.00 a month for them to send me a payment invoice vs automatic bank payments which I thought was outrageous. I paid them off about 6 months ahead of time trying to save as much as I could with the high interest rate of 18.9% and $15.00 a month invoice charges. From the very beginning I did not like the way they were representing me but I was locked into the contract and had to deal with it. I always had to track them down to find out the status of my case. No one ever updated me as to what was going on. I had to send them paperwork all the time it was never acknowledged that they received it so I never knew it they got it or not. I was always in the dark as to what was going on with my case. The IRS was always sending me letters like I have not been responding to their letters I thought that JK Harris was doing that for me because everything that the IRS or State sent me I sent to JK Harris because my understanding was that they were representing me. In April of 2006 they did present an Offer of Compromise to the IRS. The IRS denied this Offer of Compromise becasue of some wrong information that they had. When this was presented to me I immediately told my representative that this was not correct she said that she would have to send my case to another department for reseach. To speed things up I did the reseach on my own and sent them the proper paperwork showing that what the IRS had was incorrect. I thought that this would solve the problem and that the Compromise would be accepted. I waited and waited and nothing happened. Finally around April of 2007 I wrote them a disgruntled letter telling them how unsatisifed I was with the way they were handling my case, and that I was going to report them to the BBB and any complaint sites I could find. All I really wanted was some response from them and to get closure to this matter, because by now the stress has taken toll on me my health was not good and I could not sleep at night. I waited, and waited and waited. Finally in Nov. 2007 I called to find out the status of my case and was told by a very not pleasent representative that my case had been closed. I was shocked. I asked her who closed it? She said that I did and I said when did I close it? She said that when I wrote that disgruntled letter that they automatically closed my account. I was stunned here I have paid you in full and you close my account without even letting me know. Here I am still thinking that you are working on my case and you have closed it. I was really upset. The representative finally said that if I wanted the case reopened I would have to write JK Harris a letter stating this. I immediately wrote to them stressing that I wanted my case reopened and finished. I never heard word from them. NOTHING. Everthing that the representative said to me to get me to get me to sign a contract was misleading and untrue. They never even tried to negotiate with the state taxes as I was told they would, they just let the state put a lien on my home for the debt. They never finish negotiating with the IRS. So all of this time I have acurred extra late fees, interest etc. on both the IRS and State taxes. The bottom line is JK Harris ripped me off for nearly $3,000.00 and I wound up paying the IRS and the State more money because of the lack of representation that I thought I had. The time that they messed around with my case and did nothing cost me more money. I am very upset because I do not have money like that to be giving away. The money that JK Harris ripped me off for I could have used to pay on my debts. I know that I am not the only one he has ripped off, but something should be done about his being able to do this to people who put their trust in him and his services. He is on TV lying to people on a daily basis and this is wrong Finally this year 2008 I had to borrow and beg to pay these debts off because they were just getting larger and larger.
JK Harris was the biggest rip-off I've ever experienced. I paid $1300.00 for NOTHING! Let me correct myself; Worse than NOTHING! Had I gone with JK Harris' documents, I would have paid the IRS $12,000 I sisn't owe! At the initial consultation, I asked why the price was so high, and Scott assured me it was because they were The Best in America. It took nine months of badgering to get our documents, only to realize that they were completely wrong! They said I owed the IRS $12,000! When I took the papers to a to a small local tax office for corrections, they noted numerous errors (glaring, obvious errors) the IRS owed me $600.00. I contacted JK Harris, and asked that they refund our fee, but The best in America refused to answer. Completely unprofessional. I wish I had given the money to a reputable charity. Almost paid $12,000 to IRS which we didn't owe. Lost $1,300 to JK Harris for worthless work. Had to pay $700.00 to another tax consultant to straighten it out.
In September, 2006 I went to JK Harris & Company to resolve my tax issues. I owed over $9,000.00. I started with Regional Manager in NY David W. Reynolds who told me I qualified for an Offer in Compromise. On 9/19/06 I gave him a deposit of $350.00 and gave him a post dated check for the balance of $2,500.00 which was cleared on 10/16/06. $2,850 later I never had resolution. I was bounced around from David W. Reynolds to consultant Anthony Catropa to case Specialist who was assigned to me on 10/4/06, Felicia Dailey who I never heard from then Danielle Bowman who replaced Felicia Dailey who I was also not able to get in contact with, to her supervisor Pecolia Mathis who never returned my calls, then months later Nicole Jenkins who told me she was working on my problems but then never followed up. My offer in compromise wasn't given to the IRS until March 2008! By this time the IRS kept my returns for years 2006 and 2007 in addition to my rebate check of $600.00 in 2008 so the offer in compromise was denied because I know only owe $732.39. I reached out to John K Harris via e-mail and left him several voice mail messages and have not received a response. What I did receive was a letter from Finacial services advising me that they would not be giving me a refund. I'm asking for help in getting my money back as I feel I have been scammed out of $2,850.00. The IRS kept my refunds of 2006, 2007 and my 2008 tax rebate. I had to withdrwaw money out of my 401k to pay back the $2,850 that I borrowed that resulted in penalties. This situation stressed me out so much that I started to suffer from migraines and back pains.
I started with JK Harris in November-2007, they started woking on my case, and every time I turned around I had a new Rep.who had the sliightest clue of what was going on in my case, and so far my husband wages are being garnish, and they are still taking are money until I canceled the payments. I would like to know how I can get my money back, and should I hire an attorney. I can,t sleep worrying about what can be done to a company that can get away with something like this and a lost of money in this result.
I thought I was pretty savvy when it came to companies who have questionable practices, for lack of better words. So imagine how embarrass I was to find out that after feeling uneasy about this guys office, and how overly friendly he was, my husband and I gave JK Harris the benefit of the doubt. After waiting five months and $1042 later, something doesnt pan out with this company. So I check around, and sure enough, JK Harris has complaint one after another over and over again.
My husband and I entered into an agreement with JK Harris on January 11, 2008. Please note todays date; what we understood as to what was going to happen when we met with a reprehensive of JK Harris, ( Mr. Rusty J), is our tax filings being amended to include both my husband and I, to reduce what we owed in taxes. Mr. J advised us that several years of taxes would need to be amended; he also added is their anything else; we also included my educational loan that has been due; however I never could repay it due to extreme illnesses. The IRS has garnished my social security disability check, and I stated to Mr. J I needed to have that stop or reduce to a very minimal payment, he said that was fine, we could take care of that, is their anything else? Little did we know, the more we added, the more we were being charged. Days and weeks went by, and I had to call JK Harris, to see what was going on with our taxes, I find out that this person who was apparently a tax preparer, (?) said she was waiting on transcript or something from the IRS, she said they havent come in. More weeks went by, I had to call her again, and she said they came, but she needed the actual copies of our tax returns for those years. In the meantime, I got on the phone with the gentleman who was working on my school loan. He was very professional, and easy to understand, however, what we were paying JK Harris to do, the gentlemen, find out that I had already done that, which was to reduce my payments to a minimal. He then asks me, what else I wanted him to do; we both agreed he could do very little. So why are we paying JK Harris some 1900.00 with interest? Now time continues on, and its time for us to file our 2007, and we have a refund due, however it would not be realized because we are still in the process of trying to get taxes amended. The person that is handling our taxes, keeps telling me that they still need this or that document. Finally, I called her, Emily C, and ask, if you have a power of attorney for us, why arent you getting these documents. She continues to ask me to call the IRS and get these documents, after I mention to POA she said she would called them. Also, she told me she was done with our taxes but they needed originally signatures?? We never got them; in fact, we havent received anything from JK Harris, not even phone calls. The original reprehensive of JK Harris, Rusty J, of whom I sent an email to with the similar complaints, told us in our first meeting, that we would get many phone calls from the office as our taxes or being process, however, we never did. In fact, Mr. J, talked up JK Harris, and himself, pretending to be very friendly and caring, even having he and his family to meet us to show them around Houston, the next time I seen him to discuss our taxes, he acted as though he didnt know who I was, that was of course after we had already signed the contract. Today, we owe 1688.00, which are being deducted from our bank account. We have not seen anything that JK Harris has done, with regard to our taxes or student loan, after nearly six months. So my question to you is: can I get a refund???? Do you agree we shouldnt pay for what we are not getting? I noticed that companies like JK Harris, are being exposed on the web, and many consumers are now using the comments of other consumers to decide if they are going to do business with them, I believe thats one of the quickest ways to get information on a company.ask the consumer before you sign anything, I usually do that, but I wasnt feeling well, and we just rush into this. However, I will share this complaint after your response, fair enough..
on 4/26/07 i went to see mr.perdomo regarding tax issues, after he explained to me the process i said i would think about hiring their services, of course they don't let you walk out he conviced me into hiring them that i would be worried free in no time and all tax issues would be resolved, big mistake as of taday they have collected $2,000 dollars and meanwhile my husband had his wages garnished,levy sent to bank and we are on a monthly payment of $250.00 and now they are going after me they have threaten to levy me now had no other choice but to contact irs and make arrangements for a monthly payment of $50.00 meanwhile jk harris and company has not done a thing about all this that's going on, i have sent several emails to my so called case specialist and as always i'm being told this takes a while to be resolved, yeap after irs feels they collected enough from us it will definitive get resolved, thank you
We have been with them for several months and we have had 4 different people, and the issue has not been resolved, they just keep giving us the run around, we have been levyed, and still paying money to them and we need to know what we can do about it, and can we sue.
We did a bankruptcy for past taxes and other items we needed to be relieved of and were granted relief by a Federal Bankruptcy Judge in 2003. A few years later the IRS comes back and says no, you owe those past taxes and pay up now. Out BC attorney tried for 3 years to resolve this with no luck. After getting countless levy notices we decided to contact JK Harris & Assoc. after seeing one of thier ads on TV. Went to the initial appointment in Columbus GA in October 2007. First clue should have been the rep's, Stephen King, closet of an office in a high rise downtown. We let him know I am a Broker for a large real estate franchise and am pretty good at negotiating deals and such. King then baffeled us with paper work, assuring us the whole time we were going to be helped with an Offer and Compromise with the IRS with JK Harris representing us. He in reality signed us up for financial planning (what a joke that was) and yearly tax prep only. He fooled us by not checking that Offer and Compromise box on the contract. After doing so many finacial monthly reports and such we faxed and emailed them to thier rep in NC. They then mailed us a note book binder of save 10% of your income for investments and asked us how much we could realistically pay the IRS every month. We kept getting nasty grams from the IRS and finally called JK Harris in NC and asked what they were doing about this situation they were hired for. Their rep, forget her name now, told us we only signed up for finacial and tax planning services. Needless to say I freaked out and canceled the monthly service fee auto withdrwal from my checking account and wrote a letter to them cancelling thier service and requesting a refund. It was denied due to the contract they had with us. After much complaining to them they sent me a form releasing me from their contract and offering me a partial refund of $150. This is after I paid them approximatley $7000. I did not return this form because I just know better. I will never release them from this contract but they are also not getting any more of my money either. I hope they sue me! JK Harris has underhanded business practices and they take advantage of people on a daily basis and need to be stopped. No ethics or morals at this company in my opinion. lost $7000 and the IRS added more interest and penalites since. I recommend contacting the IRS directly and asking them for help. It's free and at least I know who I am talking to and am getting some results now!
Hired J.K. Harris to do an Offer In Compromise for back taxes owed. We paid them $4,000 (currently still paying off in installments) and they have done nothing. They have been unresponsive, have lost the same information 3 or 4 times, and do not respond to the IRS' requests. I cannot describe the level of anxiety I feel. I can't sleep, I am angry and frustrated and this has greatly affected my relationship due to the stress. Also, not only are the penalities and interest still accumulating I am out $4,000, for paying them to do nothing but make a bad situation worse.
I was scammed by JK Harris in Sept 2004 after watching a tv commerical on how I can reduce my tax debt pennies on the dollar. The ad is very misleading as are the sales consultant you meet in one of their 425 offices nationwide. You can either call the 888 number or go their online webpage to request help. JK Harris will schedule an appointment at a local office in your city or a nearby city. This is not a real office. JK Harris rents out an office space one day a week and their reps are not there everyday. THe day that JK Harris rents out this office space is the day that they will schedule you an appointment. The representative that calls you will ask you a few qualifying questions and schedule you an appointment with a JK Harris tax professional in your area. This person that you meet is a sales professional and by no means a tax guru. THis sales professional will use all sorts of scare tactics like if you do not use their services, the IRS will garnish your wages and put liens on your property. After meeting with a sales rep from JK Harris in Sept 2004, I put down a $500 down payment and was set up on a monthly payment plan of $219 a month with 18.9% interest rate for the remaining $2000. The IRS notified my employer in Oct 2004 that they were going to garnish my wages. I contacted a JK Harris rep that was working on my case. This rep told me that I needed to pay the whole balance before JK Harris could do anything for me. I felt screwed as the IRS was attempting to garnish my wages and JK Harris doing nothing. I went to the local IRS office on my own and got them to stop the garnishment. At this point my debt to the IRS was $23,000. I finally pay off this $2000 debt to JK Harris in Sept 2005 and now my debt is over $24,000. At this point, JK Harris has a new rep working on my case and she did not have the slightest clue to whats going on in my case. I told her that there were erroneous errors in my tax liability in the years 2000 and 2001. They did not offer to help me correct these errors and told me that I only paid them to file a tax return for one year and for anaylsis and an OIC. I felt ripped off as I paid JK Harris over $3000 to help me in my tax problems. Its January 2006, and I decided to resolve my issues with the IRS on my own and with my old employer to correct some of those mistakes. In March 2006, with the help of an local IRS office, I file ammended returns for 2000 and 2001. Its Sept 2006, and the IRS contacts me to let me know that my tax liability now is $12,000. I contacted JK Harris in OCt 2006 and let them know that thru corrections my tax liability is $12,000. JK Harris has assigned my case to a 3rd case specialist and she was more lost than the first two case specialists. This rep asks me for more bills, receipts and bank statements. In January 2007, JK Harris finally sends me a completed OIC with a $150 cashier check for the OIC fee. This OIC had numerous errors as they put in paystubs, bills, receipts and bank statements that were over 2 years old. The rep tells me that I need only to send in copies of these documents. I was looking at the requirements of the IRS and they wanted documents from the previous six months. My OIC was slowed down because of JK Harris giving me wrong advice. I was contacted by an examinar of the IRS OIC from Memphis TN in March 2007. This IRS rep was the most helpful with my OIC and asked me to send in current information that was less than 6 months old. I grew weary with JK Harris as the 3rd rep became pregnant. The fourth rep never returned my calls and I received a letter from JK Harris about a class action lawsuit in April 2007. At this point I had given up on JK Harris. Finally in July 2007, almost 3 years after going to JK Harris, my OIC was accepted. The IRS offer examinar wanted $6000 at first. I negotiated with the IRS on my own and got this down $3000 in JUly 2007. I really did this on my own and JK Harris & Co. was not helpful at all. They were slow in everything they did. I wasted 3 years and learned that I could have done this on my own in less than one year. I learned how to properly do a OIC on my own as a result of JK Harris & Co failing to do it. JK Harris & Co charges you an arm and leg to do an analysis and determine which method is best for you. THe money you pay JK Harris can be better spent on an OIC that you prepare yourself. JK Harris is only filing tax returns and OICS and nothing else. They run ads that they have over 500 years experience in dealing with the IRS with their EA's and attorneys. The truth is that JK Harris does nothing for you except file erroneous OICs that contain out of date information. JK Harris continues today to run the same deceptive ads on tv and the internet. JK Harris is not the only tax resolution company out there, as many others have joined to rip off americans with such scams. I compare this scam to the credit repairing scams. JK Harris also does credit reparing, another scam. After JK Harris & Co stopped working on my case because of class action lawsuits, I negotiated with the IRS on my own thru the OIC. JK Harris called quits working on my case after a class action lawsuit. I was better paying off the paying the IRS $12,000, my tax liability than listening to scam to get over on the IRS. Just because a company like JK Harris prepares an OIC, its no guarantee that the IRS is going to accept it. In rare occasions, where your living expenses are more or equal to your revenues, the IRS does accept OICs. JK Harris will not tell you that and instead try scare tactics to defraud you. JK Harris runs ads such as IRS problems do not go away on their own. This is a scare tactic that they are the only ones that can help you. Today the IRS is very reasonable and will work with you.
On Nov 23, 2004, my husband and I contracted JK Harris to handle our tax matters with the IRS. JK Harris required that we make a down payment of $1,000 and the remaining balance was made on a monthly basis through an automatic draft from our checking account until the total contract fee of $5,150 was paid in full. Initially, JK completed a portion of the tax years for us but then later informed us that in order to complete the remaining tax years (2004 2005), they would require an additional fee. Our representative sent the following statement: The re-contract fees for us to complete you 2004-2005 federal and state returns (4 returns in total), is $500.00. I have sent this contract along with Tax Organizer for completion, for your review and signature. Please be aware that the fees of $500.00 will need to be paid in full with the new contract. Like lots of Americans, my husband and I have struggled financially, so at the time we did not have the $500 to have the 2004-2005 returns completed. Recently, after hard work and much sacrifice, we were able to come up with the necessary funds. We assumed that since JK quoted $500 for the tax years of 2004-2005 that an additional $500 would be required for the 2006-2007 tax years. Needless to say that was not the response we received from JK Harris. Our representative informed us that in order to complete our case, we would have to recontract with them and pay IRS- $200, Master file from IRS- $200,Federal Tax Return Preparation 2004-2007- $1,000, State Tax Returns $300, $3,800. Contract would have to be paid in full. When we inquired as to why we would have to pay this large amount, the response was as follows: Unfortunately you were involved in a Class Action Settlement to which cancels your contract with us, therefore requiring a new contract should you decide you would like additional assistance from us. If you have any questions regarding this matter, please call. After numerous phone calls and searching the internet, we were informed that a mailer had been sent out by JK Harris to clients that had contracted with them informing them of the Class Action Suit. The flyer was inadvertently overlooked by me and my husband. We had no idea that information pertaining to a class action lawsuit would come from the defendant and not from the law office that was handling the case. Also, we are aware of only this one flyer that was sent out, we never saw or heard anything about the class action suit, especially since we continued to see television advertisements for JK Harris. Now we are being told from JK Harris and from the Law Office of Motley-Rice that since we did nothing, we are to be left out in the cold. We are looking for someone to give us some guidance / recourse as to what we can do. We do not have another $5000 to give to JK and at this point would not trust them to accurately handle our case with the IRS. Now we are also concerned about the accuracy of the previous returns completed by JK. We have a minimal amount of money and have no idea the cost for hiring a lawyer to handle our case. Please give us some guidance. We thought that by hiring JK Harris, we could put this tax matter behind us and move on with our lives. Our major disappointment is that in our great country, a company such as JK Harris is allowed to operate and pray on people who are trying to resolve tax matters. Thanks in advance for any assistance.
I met with a sales representative of JK Harris in Sept 2004. THis representative told me that I was in danger of having my wages garnished and that JK Harris could settle my tax debt pennies on the dollar. This rep pressured me to pay him $500 that day and set up a monthly pay plan of $219 a month for the balance of $2200. I was making payments to their collection agency at an 18% rate. In OCt 2004, the IRS filed a garnishment against my wages and JK Harris did nothing to stop this garnishment. I went to the local IRS office and stopped the garnishment on my own. JK Harris did nothing for me. I find out about a year later after making payments for a year that JK Harris will not work on your case until they receive the full balance. I decided to pay the balance in October 2005 so that they can help me with my case. At this time, my debt to the IRS was around $25,000 and I felt completly hopeless. I paid all the fees owed to JK Harris in Oct 2005 and for the next 6months JK Harris did nothing to resolve my tax issues. Its April 2006 and I decided to resolve my own issues with the IRS on my own. THere were numerous errors made by employer (the US Army) in the years 2000 and 2001. I contacted the US Army in April 2006 and finally got them to make corrections for the tax years 2000 and 2001. In Aug 2006, I got the IRS to make ammended returns for 2000 and 2001 and that reduced my IRS debt 12,000. I still contacted my rep at JK Harris and told them that I was ready to file my OIC. At this point the rep asked me to send copies of expenses and bank statements to JK Harris and CO. I did that and finally in Jan 2007 JK Harris sent me an OIC, with out of date copies of my expenses and a $150 cashier check payable to the IRS. Feb 2007 was the last time I heard from the rep at jK harris. THis was the third different rep that I worked with. THis representative became pregnant and they assigned me a 4th rep whom I did not hear from. The representatives did not contact me and instead I had to call them to get updates. I paid them well to resolve my tax issues. I lost faith with JK Harris and CO and decided to work with the IRS on my own. I filled out the OIC and sent to the IRS OIC in Memphis, TN in Feb 2007. THe office examinar for the IRS contacts me in March 2007 and she actually was more helpful than JK Harris and CO. At this point my tax debt with the IRS is only $12,000 and the examinar tells me that she needs more paperwork for the OIC. JK Harris slowed down the procedure for the OIC as they submitted receipts and bank statements for the previous two years. The IRS needed documents for the previous six months to make a decision for the OIC. In July 2007, I come to agreement with the examinar and the IRS accepts my OIC for $3000 which was lot better than $25,000.
I have never filed for any type of lawsuite,however I truely think that my case has merit. I became disabled in 2004 and withdrew funds out of my 401K plan under bad advice not to withold any early withdrawal penalties as I was diagnosed with Bi-Polar disorder and generalized anxiety disorder.It took awhile however I am currently on disability,the funds were taken out for living expenses untill my Disability went through. I hired Jk Harris and paid them $2,500 to relieve me of my tax burden for early withdrawal of my 401K funds. Jk Harris promied me that they would take my case to conclusion,and that I would be relieved of my tax burden,however after having six different anynalists,and having to send them the same information with each new anylist nothing was getting accomplished except my IRS penalties and interest continued to stack up from $45,000 to $90,000. I recently hired Omni Financial with whom I have a team of three people woking on my case and I feel as if we are making positive results. While at JK Harris & Company nothing positive was accomplished and I had so many different contacts I could not get a clear veiw of the status of my case or who was working on my Tax Resolution,if anyone.I have been waiting for six months for them to send me my case documentation. am still waiting. Due to the lack of performance on the part of JKHarris and the empty promises they made just to get my money.They have put myself and Family of five under extreme stress.We have all had to seek counseling as we watched our life savings,chidrens college funds and retirement savings being destroyed. Also I feel as if I paid JKHarris $2,500 for nothing as they did not provide the services that were promised by thier sales associate who quit the company two weeks after recieving my payment.JKHarris also let the IRS to contiue to penalize me for over $40,000 Dollars.The IRS now has a Lien on my house,and they are garnishing my Disability check all due to JKHarris not performing what they promised. Please help
I bought a house two years ago and subsequently found out that the 10% tax penalty was not withheld from my 401 deduction that I used for a down payment. That left me in a position of owing over $20,000 to the IRS in 2007. I saw HR Harris' ad on TV and gave them a call. They advertised a free consultation. I spoke with someone and felt confident enough in their plan to prepay their $1,250 fee for their service by the time I left. They gave me a folder of forms to fill out to provide them with information. I am not a big fan of paperwork, so a month went by and I still hadn't filled out and sent in the paperwork. During that month I was contacted by the IRS and was told I could set up a payment plan directly with them. By the end of the month I decided I wanted to remove more money from my 401K and take care of the amount I owed the IRS, so I called HK Harris and spoke to the man I met with telling him I have decided not to use their service after all and asked for a refund. He directed me to e-mail a man named Rod at pro@jkharris.com in the Review and Oversight Department. On 7/2/07 I sent my e-mail explaning that I no longer want their service and asked for a refund. I provided them with my customer number and both my home and cell phone numbers. On 7/9/07 I received an anonomous e-mail from the Reveiw and Oversight Department that said "Please accept this email as confirmation that your refund request has been received in the Review and Oversight Department. Our review process takes approximately 30-45 business days from the date it is received. At the conclusion of our review, a refund determination will be mailed to you. If a refund is granted, the determination letter will be accompanied by a General Release and Receipt. This document releases both parties from the contract. Once we receive the signed release, it will be forwarded to our accounting department for processing. Please do not write on, or alter the release, as it will be rendered invalid. The Review and Oversight Dept. is not available to provide status updates during the review process, however, if you have any questions or concerns, please contact your Case Specialist. Thank you in advance for your patience. We will do everything in our power to resolve this issue in as expedited a manner as possible..." We were not contacted or refunded. I sent another e-mail on 10/2/07 asking for my refund again and explained that I had contacted them back in July and have still not received my refund. Again I left both my cell and home phone numbers. On 10/03/07 I received another anonomous letter in the mail this time that said "The letter is to inform you that your request for refund has been researched and we have determined that you shall be granted a partial refund. This decision is based on the following factors: Initial processing was completed and administrative fees were incurred. Reminder-your signed contract allows JKH to retain administrative and processing fees. These fees are consdered non-refundable and may comprise up to 25%of the Total Fee. Our records indicate that you have paid $1,250.00 into your account at this time. Enclosed, please please fund a Receipt nd General Release. Once we receive the signed release, it will be forwarded for legal review to determine eligibility in pending legal settlements in which you may be included. If it is determined after the review period that your case is not eligible for settlement proceeds, we will process your signed General Release in the order in which it is received. Review and Oversight Department" This letter was strange, so I held the General Release for a couple months while I toyed with the idea of discussing the situation with a friend of mine that is an attorney. When the refund didn't come and other money matters mounted at home, I broke down and signed and returned the General Release sometime in the month of December 2007. Once again, there was total silence until my wife sent an e-mail on 3/9/08 telling them we would appreciate any effort they can make to expedite the refund. We had a phone call about a month later from a woman calling from JKH that left her first name only and a phone number with no extension on my home machine asking me to contact them. My wife got the message that evening while I was not home. Immediately upon receiving the message she called the return number and reached a general recording. She left a message saying that we received a call from the woman (she left her first name) and asked her to call again the next business day on my cell phone which my wife provided. Neither my wife nor I kept the woman's name or phone number, because we thought the call would be returned. Wrong again. We never heard from JKH again. Finally, my wife spoke with an attorney that provides us with a prepaid legal service through her job, and the attorney suggested that we write a letter explaining everything that happened so far and giving them a deadline for us to receive the money. On 4/16/08 my wife wrote a very professional looking letter with the information the attorney told her to provide, and told the Review and Oversight Department that they have until 5/1/08 to refund my money or we will be seeking legal consultation. Not surprisingly, they did not respond or send the money. My wife is now researching how to take them to small claims court to try to regain our money when she saw the JK Harris complaints website. It was 22 pages long! She is still searching the web to find out where we have to go to take JK Harris to court. She feels that if JK Harris were a legitimate company they would have just sent the refund in a timely manner. After seeing the 22 page website of complaints we realize that we were scammed and we probably won't be receiving any money. We are savvy of the usual types of scams like itentity theft and people who call you trying to get your social security number, but we weren't ready for a scam from a company that advertises on TV. $1,250.00 plus whatever interest we could have made on it in the nearly a year we've been trying to get it back.
We misplaced a decimal on our NC taxes. We rec'd a bill for $14,500. Since we were right in the middle of moving to FL, we tried to 'fix' it here, and went to JKHarris when we saw their ad on TV. We were assured it was minor and would be fixed quickly and requested $2000. One month later we were contacted by NC telling us we'd been put in the hands of collections. Three wks late we were notified of a 20% penalty. We then went to H&R Block for information as to what we should do, and lo and behold they fixed it right then and there for $40. This problem is nation wide, and with all the complaints I do not know why the Justice system does not kick in. As far as we are concerned Harris stole our $2000
In 2003 my wife and I contacted the IRS about what we could do about our tax debt, which at that time was about $18,000. The representative I spoke with told me that we could file what is called an Offers in compromise. We did this, but was denied our request. Then we heard about JK Harris. We met with a representative from them and were told they could negotiate our tax debt down to somewhere between $1,000 and $3,000. Sounded pretty good to us, so we agreed to pay them $3,500 to do this. Ha! They would request information on income and expenses and then fill out the forms with incorrect info, so that it skewed what we made and what we could pay. Long story short after 3 years they did absolutly nothing for us. We ended up paying the IRS $22,000 after we re-financed our house. WE WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND J.K. HARRIS. They screwed us. Never filed a complaint with them or the BBB because we saw how many complaints they had against them and a lot were unresloved and figured we would never get a refund anyway.
DO NOT USE J K HARRIS TAX RESOLUTION COMPANY.....THEY ARE A RIP OFF! We hired J K HARRIS in Sept 2006. We did not hear from them for a while so I thought they were working on the problem...I call my salesman at J K HARRIS. LUIS ESCOBAR and of course I get his voice mail. I then called J K HARRIS office and they could not find much information. It turns out LUIS ESCOBAR misplaced the file for 6 months, now its 6 months later which is March 2007. Luis apologizes for misplacing the file and says that we need to sign some papers immediately but the office closest to my house he does not have a key for on Saturday. We drive to his office on Saturday March 17th and you will not believe this but he could not get in that office so here we are sitting in the lobby of his building signing all of these papers. What a joke.. I should have known something was up at that time but they lie to you and all you want is some help. Now we have 6 months more of penalties and interest thanks to J K HARRIS. Next we get a bunch of paper work that needs to be filled out for the Offer in Compromise-by the way you can do and OIC with the IRS directly and it only costs 150.00 not the 5000.00 JK HARRIS was charging in addition to the 18% loan shark interest rates they were charging. I fill out the paper work as best as I can since it was very confusing and send it back at the end of April 2007. I never hear back from them so you assume they are working on this. I called JK HARRIS in August 2007 because we were trying to refinance our home and there was a federal tax lien on the credit report and was told by a rep that the paper work was filled out incorrectly and nothing has been done. I asked her why they never advised us for 3 months that the paper work was incorrect and all she said was you should have been. Great customer service---NOT.. We decided to cancel our contract after they received 3495.00 out of the 5000.00 they wanted. I sent a letter requesting a refund 10/5/07 and did not hear back from them until 11/26/07 saying they will only give me 1086.00. I questioned that amount since they only did 5 years of tax returns and nothing else. I never heard back from them about the refund amount so I reluctantly signed the form and faxed it on 1/15/08. I called to see if they got the fax and they said they did and was advised at that time that the check would be delayed due to a class action lawsuit filed by former clients that got ripped off just like everyone else has. On 3/11/08 I talked to the most useless supervisor ever named Chris Debeaux to see where my refund was and he advised me the check will be sent on 4/25/08. Well it is 4/30/08 and I just checked the mail and no check yet. I called immediately and have been on hold with the refund department for 1 hour and 40 minutes. I think the office is closed but I still keep hearing the same old message saying that JK HARRIS can help with your tax problem.... THEY CAN NOT AND WILL NOT. My mortgage is due and I want my refund plus interest.
In May of 2007 I had contacted JK Harris because I was having major Tax issues and desperately needed help. I spoke with the consultant and she assured me they could help me reduce and resolve my stressful situation with my taxes. Over the last 11 months it has been a nightmare. Not knowing what is happening and me filling out all the paperwork with no help from JK Harris to see if I completed the documents right. The only person I was allowed to talk to was the service rep. and when I asked to talk to the tax specialist I was refused on several occasions. I even emailed my request and did not get a reply. I sent JK Harris emails regarding the disturbing information I was getting about their company and they assured me that was just disgruntled clients that did not do what they were required to do to qualify. Now I have been denied my state OIC and I am paying $300.00 a month and 4/25/08 I received a letter from IRS telling me that my OIC was not approved and I have to make installment payments of $3448.00 a month. I might as well curl up my toes and die because I only bring home $3770.00 a month. How does anyone expect someone to live on $22.00 a month for five years? Guess I need to find a cardboard box and find the nearest shelter to get food from because $22.00 will not even pay for my gas to go to work. Then the tax specialist that they tell you, you have to have does not have your best interest at heart. I had to hire a CPA to go over my faxes and fill out the paperwork just so I could send it to JK Harris to type up and I have to pay $480.00 a year for 3 years for this service? I keep calling them and they are rude and provide me with no information. It took me 10 months just to get the information I am required to make quarterly tax payments and that is only because they sent me a letter telling me I had 4 days to send the money or the offer would be dropped. I had to get an auto title loan at 219% interest just to pay the quarterly taxes and a loan for $5000.00 from a friend to pay my 2007 taxes. JK Harris has stressed me out over my tax situation I am getting panic attacks and I hardly leave my house except to go to work. Now I have been denied my state OIC and I am paying $300.00 a month and 4/25/08 I received a letter from IRS telling me that my OIC was not approved and I have to make installment payments of $3448.00 a month. I might as well curl up my toes and die because I only bring home $3770.00 a month. How does anyone expect someone to live on $22.00 a month for five years? It took me 10 months just to get the information I am required to make quarterly tax payments and that is only because they sent me a letter telling me I had 4 days to send the money or the offer would be dropped. I had to get an auto title loan at 21.9% interest just to pay the quarterly taxes and a loan for $5000.00 from a friend to pay my 2007 taxes.
On 3/1/06 my husband and I started a claim with JK Harris - everyone was friendly and seemed to be helpful at the time. Of course we had to setup up payment with JK which they automatically deducted money from our checking account each month until the fee was paid on time. During the first month we were asked to send in paperwork, we sent in so much paperwork we could have made a tree. Second month, no contact, so we called, third month no contract, we called and then was asked to send in more paperwork, each month their after my husband and I were forwarded to voicemail. I went to the office on numerous occassions and were told no one was in. After a year, IRS sent me a letter stating they were going to garnish my wages and checking account. I told the Agent at IRS that I was working with JK Harris, she stated nothing was on file. I called JK Harris on numerous times their after received no help. A month later I got a letter from JK Harris in Charleston asking if I wanted them to clear my back taxes. I stated I thought that's what we paid for over a year ago. The agent was nasty. I asked for a refund, the gentlemen stated I had to send in a formal letter which I did (have copy), he also stated I should get a refund in 7 business days, I called back got this rude agent she stated it takes 90 to 120 days, this was in August of 2007. I called back asked to speak to the MGR he stated the same thing. I stated I looked over the agreement that my husband and I initially signed and it's not on there, he stated he knew they left it off. It's up to the consumer to ask. Who would think a company taking over $4,000 out of your checking would not deliver - here it is April 2008 and I have still not received my refund. My husband and I call on a regular basis. I was told numerous dates that I would receive my refund. The last date was April 22, 2008 and now it's put off to May 22. I believe JK Harris is not going to settle with any of us. I taped each phone call from the conversations the director got mad and hung up the phone after I told him I was recording all calls that I make to them. I know it's not permissible in court, but if more people know just how this company works maybe they will think differently. All I want is my full refund. I do not think they should give us a portion after all they did not do anything but take the application. I am willing to give the application fee.
I went to JK Harris for help with my tax returns as IRS had a levy on my pay. The individual that I met with said they could reduce my debt, set up a payment plan and will probably do a settlement. I wound up paying them $3600 and I still owe what I originally owed plus interest and penalties. They did not do any negotiating. They initiated a 3 way call and I spoke with IRS on my behalf. I am angry that I paid JK Harris money that I could have used to help pay off my debt with IRS. Other than being under a financial strain, there was plenty of anxiety and worry. read more hide
I was assured that this company could reduce my taxes owed by quite a bit. I paid them $3000 to do this. After 5 months I was sent a letter stating they could do nothing except set me up on a payment plan. I could have done that. They took a lot of personal information, asking me to send it, which I did numerous times at my expense-- only to be told they couldn't help me. I accumulated interest as the months went on with the taxes I owed. They took the $3000 and did absolutely NOTHING! I could have used that money ($3000) to pay off some of the taxes owed. This company lures you in knowing you are desperate to get your taxes resolved and convinces you they can do this. I feel very ripped off and have asked for my money back--but have not heard from them. This is not a company anyone should use---they take your money and run with it, without ANY resolutions to your problems. read more hide
We too had a disgraceful experience with JK Harris, numerous case workers,stretching over 3 years. Why, oh why does anyone continue to do business with this company who have no morals. They took our money, in total 5,000 and like everone else would not offer a refund after letting us down. We ended up owing over twice our original debt and will never get back that 5,000. We are the people who can least afford to lose this kind of money, that's why we go to them to begin with read more hide
They lead me on for almost a year and $3000.00. When the IRS compromise was denied, they claimed they couldn't appeal. I requested a supervisor call back but I hadn't heard anything from them until I got an ad to file my taxes with them. Please let us all continue to call Chrisie Roby a rep at JK harris and request our refund. I think JK Harris is a professional rip off company. We should contact the SC chamber of commerce. My penalties have increased and I owe more now. read more hide
We hired them to help us with our tax situation back in 2005. They were paid and never did anything to help. We had tax liens put on us, etc. We asked for our money back and were told we would get it back in Dec. 2007 because of the backup they had. We have since been faxing the letter they sent us back to them, and to this date have not received our money. Because of their mess up, we were forced to file bankruptcy. We NEED our money! Please help us! read more hide
I hired this company to represent me for my tax liability, to help me set up a payment plan, and to review my '06 tax return to make sure everything was accurate. They did absolutely nothing and missed my opportunity for my hearing. The IRS levied my bank accounts and now are ready to put a lien on my property. I send JK Harris e-mails, and I call; but no one returns my call. They charged me for the service of helping me and charged my credit card in full the day after I signed the contract; and now 6 weeks later nothing...and my account is levied. I am waiting to see when they will lien my home. JK Harris completely defrauded me regarding their services, and completely took advantage of me and my situation. The IRS levied my bank account almost $8500.00, and JK Harris charged me $8500.00 for doing nothing. read more hide
They never send me paperwork on what I need to send them. They pass me from person to person. They do not communicate in their own office with each other. I pay them $289 a month for no services. I started in April 2006. This has caused me severe depression and thoughts of suicide. read more hide
I got involved with JK Harris in 2004, with my mother and sister's encouragement. My family and I saw an ad on TV and decided to go with them. We met and paid out over $3000 to them. I was told that JK Harris would handle all the taxes and make a settlement with the IRS and State. Then one day I received a letter telling me that there was a class action suit against them. I tried to call to see if they were going to handle my taxes, and they were rude to me. I did not respond to the suit, yet I am in it regardless. Now I do not know what to do. My taxes are up in the air, and I worry everyday what will happen. I keep getting letters for demand of payment from the IRS. I worry about my wages being garnished by the IRS. I worry if IRS will show up at my doorstep. It has effected my marriage; since I did not check the Better Business Bureau, my wife is really upset. We were separated at the time and did this without talking to her. read more hide
I met with a representative of J K Harris on September 11, 2007 in Charlottesville, VA. We spoke in great lengths regarding my federal income tax concerns. The representative explained to me how J K Harris could assist me and resolve my IRS concerns. Also, he quoted a fee for the services and stated once I made the initial down payment, the services would start immediately. I made an initial deposit of $500.00 and J K Harris has debited my checking account in the amount of $388.00 per month for the last four months. My total payments to this company equal $2,052.00. I received a letter from the Internal Revenue Service dated February 8, 2008 stating J K Harris & Company was no longer acting as my attorney and they requested I set up a payment arrangement. I was shocked because I had not received any literature from J K Harris regarding this matter and they continued to debit my checking account monthly for their fees. My daughter and I contacted J K Harris by phone on February 12, 2008 requesting an explanation for the letter I received from the IRS. A representative stated the Power of Attorney was not valid and they were going to get a new Power of Attorney. Also, she stated J K Harris didn't have all of the information they needed from me. I informed the rep I have supplied all of the information requested and if I had not; why didn't someone contact me? It has been six months since I accepted the services of J K Harris and I have made monthly payments accordingly. It has become clear they have not provided the services promised. Equally important the representative I spoke with at J K Harris on 2/12/08 was unprofessional and insensitive to my concerns. Due to the level of service I have received, I searched the internet to take a closer look at J K Harris. During my initial search, I've found dozens of complaints made against J K Harris from consumers like myself. I feel I have been taken advantage of (scammed) by J K Harris. I am requesting a full refund of all of the funds they have collected from me totaling $2,052.00. J K Harris has taken money from me and they have not provided the services promised. Therefore, I have filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau and seeking contact with the Attorney General. I am a senior citizen. I receive social security and work part-time. I've paid money to J K Harris I didn't have to spare. This has created a financial hardship for me monthly. It is almost impossible for me to meet my monthly living expenses. read more hide

I retained JK Harris for my tax issues. My tax problem began in 2005. I retained JK Harris manager D. Bush requested $3,500 when I sat down for the consultation in the Las Vegas Office On Tropican Ave on May 29th 2007. Within two months I paid the full amount thinking I was on my way to resolve this issue. I had given all necessary copies of tax and receipts. I did my part I started to call in October because I have not received any letter, phone call, nothing. After several attempts I was finally speaking with a live person who told me that my original case worker was replaced, meaning nothing was done from May- October, the next call was from the new case worker Damita Simmons. I was never updated on my case status unless I picked up the phone and when I did call she was always busy on another line. I soon learned I had to tell them (I just spoke with her and returning her phone call). I just received in the mail a letter stating they could not help me after all these months and while the penalty fees and interest fees have gone up I owe more now for no reason only because JK HARRIS failed to keep me informed on my case status. I called Damita Simmons asking her why and she had told me that I needed to show more money going out and less coming in. I had given her My medical bills form my cancer treatment and my spouses change of income status in December now she is telling me I have to send it again mean while months will go by and my owe to the IRS will go up. I WAS A VICTIM OF A CRIME OF THIS SERVICE AND THEY ARE GETTING AWAY WITH IT. I am working two part time jobs now even while going though chemo and radiation. I am far from 100%. I understand I was at fault for not reporting all my income but that was due to being out of the country and only receiving some of my statements. I acted as soon I was notified of the audit and by that time I was going for my treatments. I did not ignore filing my taxes. I have always filed, but my health was a big set back. So now I have no other choice but to answer to the IRS directly and the $3,500 I will never see again. read more hide
We contacted J.K. Harris to help us with out tax debt and agreed to pay $250.00 a month. After paying $500.00 my husband lost his job. I called them and requested a break in contract and request for refund. They told me to fax them a statement, and it would take 30 days to refund. After 30 days I called them and asked the status on the refund. I was transfered to someone who put me on hold for 1 hour and 33 minutes, and I finally hung up and called back and got a recording that I had called after hours. I was outraged, and I emailed the corp. office and told them that this was not fair trade practices. My next call is to the Federal Trade Commission. From reading all the other complaints, I am the lucky one that stopped them before they did anything, anyway. My husband is now employed and making less money, but IRS did reduce our payment. The IRS told me if we submitted an offer of Compromise, they would levy our property and house anyway. read more hide
In approximately August 0f 2006 I hired JK Harris to assist me to expunge my tax debt through offer and compromise. I met with a lady in Topeka KS who seemed to know what she was talking about and submitted my initial paperwork as well as a series of checks, to get the process rolling on my tax debt that is way out of control. I felt good leaving the consultation feeling as though I would get resolution to the problem for which I sought relief. Over the next 30 days the initial contact had left the company, and I was assigned to another person who was to pick up the ball and get the relief I was seeking. Over the next 90 days or so, I was handed off to three more people each one promising to be the last person to handle my case. After nearly 12 months,and about 30 phone calls later, I thought we had come to an end of my nightmare. Finally an offer in Compromise to send to the IRS! Oh happy day I thought; but $6,598.20 to JK Harris later, and $11,680.00 to the IRS--MAYBE I will finally have this nightmare behind me and can get on with life. About 90 days went by, and I got a response from a representative of the IRS who told me my offer had been rejected and that the money I had paid would be forfeited. The same story from JK Harris. I am devastated by this because it has been over 18 months since I hired J K Harris to bring resolution to this tax indebtedness for me as they advertise. Now I am out another 18 months and $18,000.00--still with no finality to this situation. Prior to this JK Harris I hired another that did the same thing: took my money and told me there was no way after taking over $2500.00 from me, that this could be resolved. This is why I went to J K Harris--they were to be THE BEST at resolving tax issues. I now know better and still do not know where to go to get resolution. I am told by J K Harris that I cannot get my money back nor will I get credit from the IRS for the monies I have paid. I do not know where to turn next. Please send me suggestions; I am about as desperate as I can get to resolve this issue. This IRS indebtedness has grown and has ruined my credibility financially. I am on the breakpoint of losing my business, and I cannot afford to hire another firm to handle this situation because I trusted that JK Harris was dealing effectively with the IRS on my behalf. I cannot get married, I cannot get financial assistance to maintain my business any more,and am on the verge of complete failure physically and mentally. I do not own a vehicle nor a home anymore. I have only a small living space where my work is. I want this nightmare behind me. I want to have a life again. My health is going down the tube from the stress of this whole tax issue I believed was getting tended. read more hide
These people use deceptive sales tactics. I fully explained my tax situation to their adviser in West Des Moines, who in turn took a post dated check from me, along with an agreement to pay them $3,000 over 12 months for services. Two months later, I was informed that NO WORK had been performed on my case and that I would need to pay an additional $1,200 in CASH before any services would be rendered. The sales person lied to me. I paid them $600 for nothing and the refuse to refund me. They know exactly how to swindle people who are in crisis. I'm out $600 in payments, plus penalties and interest to the IRS accrued for the two and a half months they did nothing for me. read more hide
I connected JK Harris in early 2007 about back taxes for 2005 & 2006. After paying them $1200.00, all they did was push me around from one person to another. After my wages were garnished, I contacted the IRS myself. After that I connected JK Harris about a refund. I was told all I could except was $700.00. I have signed two release forms and still don't have my refund. And no one will return my calls. As a result of no help with my taxes, I ended up behind in my bills, plus I now owe more to the IRS then when this all started. I am paying a monthly amount to the IRS which just keeps growing every day. At this rate I will never get my taxes paid off. Thank you for any thing you can do to help in the matter. read more hide
After over 2 years on working on my account and as we were getting to a payment plan, they allowed the IRS to garnish 3 of my pay checks which has put me and my family into a terrible financial bind.

I contracted the services of the JK Harris company in 2006. At the time of our contract I had a written estimate from JK Harris that stated my tax debt to the IRS would be settled for somewhere between $400 and $1500. I paid JK Harris $930.00 as down payment and then $182.00 monthly for 12 months. At the end of the 12 months I was told by JK Harris that I owed the IRS $5000.00 more than I had owed them when we started, and that the IRS would only agree to put my account on hold. With-in two weeks of being told that by JK Harris, I received letters from the IRS instructing me to call them, which I did. They told me that they had never received any of my documentation from JK Harris, and they in fact only had one documented phone call from them during the entire year. Interestingly enough,during that particular conversation with the IRS employee, we came upon a solution that would allow me to pay my debt to them at a later date when we assume my financial situation will probably improve. JK Harris did absolutely nothing to improve or even change my situation with the IRS. They lied and cheated me at every step of the way. I lost the $3114.00 that was paid to JK Harris; plus additional interest and fines were assessed to my tax debt to the IRS. read more hide
I retained the services of JK Harris to help me resolve tax issues for the years 2004, 2005, and 2006. They gladly accepted my payment of $2400. It is now December, 2007, and I have a levy on my accounts and a tax burden of $140,000 due to back taxes, interest, and penalties. Every time I called I was given the run around...my case had been changed to another agent, they were working on it, etc. When I came home on Oct.1, 2007 to find an IRS agents card on my doorstep, I called JK Harris and demanded to speak to a supervisor...no one called me back. I called the next day...no one called me back. On October 31st, when I had a certified letter with notification of intent to levy, I called again. Stephanie informed me Allen Dikerson was now on my case and would get everything taken care of. I have yet to hear from Allen! I explained I had filed 2004 and 2006...but was still waiting on my 2005 tax report from them to be filed. I then got a run around from them that they were only supposed to do 2004 and 2006! Why in the world would I have hired them for 2004 and 2006...but not 2005? On November 24 I received a letter from the IRS that my wages and accounts were being levied! I have been trying for over a year to resolve this issue. I was referred to a local CPA to whom I have now paid $500. In less than a week they have prepared and filed my 2005 taxes. I had a phone conversation with the IRS agent that left his card on my door; the CPA found glaring errors in the JK Harris prepared returns for 2004 and 2006 that are going to cost me an additional $15,000 in penalties and interest. JK Harris needs to be stopped! I am going to have to pay a $2500 per month payment for the next 5 years to pay off this debt! They prey on fear and lack of knowledge regarding tax law and the IRS! I am not sure how they sleep at night knowing what they are doing to people's lives! I now have a tax debt of $140,000! My accounts have been levied, I will not get a paycheck for the month of December, and I am not sure how I will pay my mortgage, fuel to get to work, groceries, etc. My CPA has informed me I can expect a payment plan of $2500 for the next 5 years once we do get the payment plan set up; this is over 1/2 of my pay! I have no idea yet what the extent of my financial damage will be. I am sure this will affect my credit report, etc. read more hide
I went to JK Harris for help with an IRS issue. After I paid $1000 and signed papers did I find out they are not attorneys and are a paper filing company. I received forms including power of attorney that I signed and sent back, without any additional communication for almost a year. Then IRS contacted my employer to garnish 75% of my wages, at which point I paid them from my savings. I contacted the J.K. Harris rep and sent an online request and also through the USPS for a refund. I was sent forms again saying that I was to receive a $750 refund if I promised to not say anything adverse about the JK Harris Company. The promise was that I would get my refund in two to four months. I signed those documents, and a year later I have not received my refund. I have been stalled by this company and ripped off. read more hide
I was behind and owed the IRS. My husband was dying from cancer. We went to JK Harris for help. The immediately took cash and let us sign a contract. this was in April, and in July I was levied and my husband's diagnosis was changed to terminal (months). JK Harris would not return my calls and insulted me when I spoke to them. They informed me I would have to pay them, including all penalties, etc. I stopped payments to them and handled it on my own. I have a payment plan with the IRS and had the levy lifted. My husband died on Jan 9, 2007 and now they have sent a collection agency after me. I need help and fast. I nearly lost my mind and now have to deal with the collection people. It's my first holiday season alone and the emotional stress is overwhelming. Please help me. I already paid them nearly $2k and they want $3k more and are ruining my credit. They cannot be allowed to get away with this. To my knowledge they only ever made one call to the IRS on my behalf, but the IRS said I would have to get a lawyer and supeona the records. I cannot afford this. read more hide
In August 2006 we were told by JKHarris we certainly qualified for an offer in compromise and should need to pay 1/2 of what we owed at the most. Eight months later they finally submitted paperwork for the OIC. They had 1 Individual that worked with us. Once our payment plan was over that was it--absolutely no contact no matter how often I called. Now (November 2007), of course, the IRS has denied our OIC and I have no where to go. We have tied up 15 months in paperwork with JK Harris, and $3500 went to the company; and I could have sent that to the IRS! May the lord have mercy on their souls. I thought I had spent that time and money moving forward and not falling behind. read more hide
I gave JK Harris $10,000 for a tax problem that I had with my business. They never returned my calls, nor sent forms that I needed to fill out; and when I did fill out some forms, I never heard back from them. I got a letter from them saying that they were no longer representing me. I sent them a letter back saying I still wanted them to. The next letter I got was from the IRS saying JK Harris withdrew their representation letter for me. They have done nothing for me except take my $10,000. I don't know where to go from here. I have tax liens against my home and personal liens against me for over $190,000. I can never sell my house or get credit. The IRS levies my checking accounts, and the state has a garnishment against my wages. read more hide
I was in a panic about my tax situation and terrified of dealing with the IRS on my own as so many are. I met with one of J.K. Harris' reps and was told that for about $5000, they could take care of my situation. Well, if I had $5000, then I would just hand it to the IRS and wouldn't be in the situation I'm in. He pretty much tried to scare me in telling me that dealing with the IRS on my own was up to me but that it was a big risk and that they'd probably freeze my accounts and that I could even go to jail. Something didn't seem right, so I called the IRS myself after that and encountered the nicest person who not only sympathized with my situation but stayed on the phone and provided me with the exact info I needed to work out my IRS problem. In 2 days I called back ready to fax the paperwork they wanted to help me and got an even nicer person to help me and ended up resolving my tax issues on my own in 2 phone calls and a fax to the IRS for $5000 cheaper than J.K. Harris wanted to charge me. read more hide
I had $39,000.00 debt with the IRS. They were threathing to take action,. I saw the ad on the tv and visited my local JK Harris Office who stated not to worry any more and that I would not have to pay the IRS but $2,900.00. Well i continued to receive letters from the IRS. I contacted the IRS, and they stated that they had not heard one word form JK Harris. They placed a lien on all my assets. My credit went down. I lost everything financially and have not been able to re-coop my losses. I think JK Harris should have to pay my entire tax bill plus pain and suffering, and they should be shut dow. They are still advertising on tv. They foreclosed on my house. My bills were not paid; my credit cards are defaulted. I am unable to purchase anything because my credit score is low. read more hide
I retained JK Harris company in Oct. 2006. I borrowed money to pay the $2,300 fee. I was told there is a one-time forgiveness clause for individuals in my circumstances. However, IRS never heard of that. Several IRS agents that I talked to said they never heard of JK Harris. I kept getting IRS Notices of Intend to Levy. JK Harris filed a Form 433-A, Collection Information Statement. Shortly thereafter, I received a Final Notice to Levy. At that point, I set up a payment plan with IRS. If I hadn't, I was told that my bank accounts would be frozen and a tax lien would appear on my credit report. After doing that, I wrote JK Harris to cancel the contract and requested a refund. They wrote me back saying the contract is completed. read more hide
I entered into agreement with JK Harris to resolve a state tax issue.Was assured by the initial represenative that this matter would be no problem for the company. I made a down payment of $350.00 and several monthly payments of $200.00.Case specialist assigned requested ceartain documents be submitted and these were. Requests by me for status updates were ignored. J K Harris was informed that due to their non-response in this matter, I would make no future payments and requested a refund of monies paid and return of personal documents that were mailed to them. These requests have been ignored and no contact has been made by J K Harris in this matter. Due to a lack of J K Harris doing anything the state involved obtained a judgment against me for a significant sum of money. I would not recommend the use of this company by anyone. Their only care seems to be in receiving payments for work not performed. read more hide
Its funny Same complaints as everyone else They took 18 months to submit an OFC and requested the same information five or six times over and over. They did not submit the state and fed at the same time even though they needed the exact same info.

At the time my problem was a simple one, I had made a mistake on my 2005 tax form and IRS wanted blood to prove it was a mistake. Out of frustration I turned to J.K. Harris after seeing their ad on TV promising to end my nightmare. Within months of paying them over $1,500.00 my social security check was garnished, my part-time wages on my job were garnished and my checking account was frozen. In a panic I contacted their office and was told someone would contact me immediately. In the meantime, IRS was wiping me out. I couldn't wait, I had to deal with IRS myself. In the meantimne, they had my money and I ended up doing all the work which took me over a year to straighten out. My credit is ruined and I am just beginning to deal with that. Instead of them relieving me of my tax nightmares they changed the nightmare to JK Harris nightmares. Something has to be done. I am on a fixed income and this just isn't fair. I can't believe they have been allowed to get away with this for so long. read more hide

We paid $4,525 in 2004 and have received absolutely no services. When we mentioned this concerned to JK Harris, they responded that they had already begun working on our case. We contacted representatives from the IRS to verify this claim and confirmed that they had NEVER contacted the IRS. We have been simply asking for a refund of our original payment and have received minimal response and ultimately an offer to refund about two thirds of our original $4,525. Until this day, we have received no refund and no service. Our penalties continue to rise and accrue. read more hide

I went to JK Harris back in Sept. 2006 in hopes to settle my debt w/the IRS. They were so nice and helpful w/their promising words that they will help me remove my large debt w/the IRS. So... thinking this was actually the right thing to do, I put my down payment of about $850 which my daughter was kind enough to lend. After that, I set up an automatic debit of $218 to be taken off my account. Until this day they are still taking money, which is fine if they actually DO THEIR JOB! I have had nothing but stress and frustration caused by my case specialist. She is careless, lack of follow up, no customer service, & above all, doesn't have a clue what she is doing. I have escalated my issues to a supervisor, and I all I get is them buying time. It has been almost 2 months and the IRS has but a levy and both my husband and my checks are being garnished for about $1000 a month. That's on top of the $218 I pay automatically to JK Harris. It is by far the worst I've had to deal with and so what do they do. read more hide
The IRS put a lien on my military pension in 1999. As soon as the lien was lifted (I owed about $3000), J.K. Harris' cooperation vanished.

Company is very responsive on the front end, untill they get you to sign the contract. In other words, high pressure sales. Once the contract is signed, they are harder to get hold of then IRS itself. For a 2000 and some dollar fee I have an expectation of a LOT more responsive customer service. Also, I would expect an itemized list of services performed. I thought I hired a firm to assist me in communicating and working out things with the IRS, instead I feel like I ran into a place that took my last $2000 and rendered no services, at least not to my knowledge. As a client of a firm that was given a power of attoerney top represent me with IRS, I believe I should be able to find out what services have been rendered, or actions taken in my name. Now I'm left without resources for accounting or legal representation to resolve my case with IRS. read more hide
I contacted JK Harris when I got a notice from the IRS saying I owed around $40,000 from 2001. It should have been simple to fix as they put all my business income, without deductions, as personal income instead of a partnership, LLP. Many calls and no call backs and when I would get hold of someone they would tell me my case was handed over to someone else. Finally I got a letter from the IRS that JK Harris was no longer representing me, by then my IRS bill was $50,000. I contacted my accountant and he met with the IRS and they said they won't add any more penalties or interest for 3 months so I will have time to fix the problem. So far it has cost me about $10,000 in fees from IRS. read more hide

I contacted them for IRS levies and they never provided the services they assured me that they would. I made several attempts to contact them via email and phone and my inquiries went unanswered until I emailed the president. I received a call from Ms. Garrett informing me that my representative had taken ill and that is why my account had not received processing. I asked for a refund back in August 2006. I received a general release letter, granting me a partial refund and I'm still waiting for the refund. I have yet to receive the payment or, an answer in regard to my refund. As a result, I was losing over $1,000 per month which has resulted in me losing my apartment. I'm still paying the taxes that they were supposed to prepare the offer and compromise for. Once I receive the refund, I will get another company to clean up the mess, JK Harris failed to clean up. read more hide
I received a CP-2000 for an enormous amount and freaked out over what the IRS was asking for. I called JK Harris, met a representative who really was just a glorified salesman. He maintained that he knew some of the tax code, but when I went in depth to the issues, and explained that the CP-2000 might be an IRS error, he laughed and said the IRS will come after me and if you simply put down $1500 now, we can make this go away. So I did. I was then making monthly payments to JK Harris and in total spent $3000.00. On the side, I was working with an IRS Taxpayer Advocate and eventually, all but a few thousand dollars were stricken from the CP-2000. I surely feel that JK Harris should have been able to do this. When I called them and said I know longer needed their services (because they had up to then done nothing whatsoever except request documents of me), I was told I would get a refund. It has now been a year and dozens of phone calls and yet, no refund. Getting a CP-2000 does not feel good, and it is easy to feel a lot of fear. I think the JK Harris salesman capitalized on this, sold me the package and that was it. I tried leaving him messages on his phone, to ask for help, and never got a return call back. I would say, attempt to file the OIC on your own. I see no value in what JK Harris has to offer, and their customer service and response time is abysmal. ˆ read more hide
We met with a JK Harris consultant in Denver and explained our tax situation. We told the consultant that time was of the essence because both my husband and I had received recent Notice of Intent to Levy's. The consultant assured me that JK Harris deals with this all the time. He asked for $500 and said they would get started immediately. I wrote a check for $500 that day. The only other contact I have had with JKH was when I call to find out the status. Each time, they give a different excuse. A form needs to be re-faxed because they can't locate the one we gave the consultant on the 21st; it's no longer that person's department handling our case; and on and on. In the meantime (months later), the IRS has now filed a Lien on me and a Wage Levy on my husband. read more hide
Sums up like this. I had an issue in 2001 for taxes owed. I went to see JK Harris and disclosed all of my financial information. They determined that they would be able to take my case to OIC with the IRS. $3000 they took and now 4 years later the IRS levied all of my assets today without warning. I never got any calls from this firm unless I called numerous times only to get no information. They did nothing, gave me forms directly from the IRS after 4 years as if I couldn't do that myelf. They never provided me with any work they had done on my behalf. And now i called and wrote the begging for help and they still wont return my plea. read more hide
We had tried to work with the IRS our self. But they wouldn't take our offer in compromise and the payment they wanted would have left us about $500.00 a month to live on. So we went to see Mr. Fenski who was working for J.K. Harris. We told him our story. He said that the IRS couldn't take our property, which is where we were living. He was sure that they could work something out with the IRS. He had worked for the IRS and knew they couldn't do this. So over about the next 10 months we paid them almost $1000. When we got the notice that the IRS was auctioning our property in about a month, we called J.K.Harris as we were told to do if we got anything from them. After a week we called them again, and again. After two weeks they told my husband that there was nothing that they could do! Mind you that we were told my this man that they didn't take cases unless they were sure they could win. Well, May 4, 2006 they auctioned our property, with us setting there watching them. Not only were we horribly lied to, but were left open for the IRS to take the only place we have to live. And paid Harris for this. read more hide
I received a Notice of Intent to Levy on back taxes. I went to JK Harris in an effort to get this resolved. I paid $500 up front and was pitched a credit repair deal for an additional $750, for a total contract of $3250. JK Harris debited my bank account for a total of $1290 over 3 months. When I received the 2nd Notice of Intent to Levy I attempted to contact my account rep with no results. I finally contacted the IRS and was told that no one from JK Harris had made any attempt to contact them on my behalf. Fortunately I was able to resolve my issues with the IRS myself. I emailed JK Harris and told them that I had spoken with the IRS, the following day a very nice IRS agent contaced me to let me know that someone representing JK Harris was requesting information on my account and did I want to go ahead and release the information. I declined and then requested a full refund from JK Harris. 2 weeks later I received a letter that said the request would be considered and that I would receive the answer in 30 -45 days. It has been over 60 and no check and no letter of decline. From my experience this appears to be a serious case of conspiracy to commit fraud, mail fraud and wire fraud all perpetrated by personnel at JK Harris company. read more hide
Paid JK Harris 2100.00 for nothing!! but fustration. Lost my paper work several times, no return calls, no urgency. Received lien on wages and property two years after hiring JK who did nothing. I ended up resolving my own offer in compromise since his office screwed the form up three times. I ended up settling for less than JK Harris said was a "very Good deal". read more hide
On December 22, 2005, my paycheck was garnished, I got $347. Desperate for some assistance I found an ad indicating that JK Harris & Company was "the best", according to the Wall Street Journal. Mr. Pelle indicated that he would fax my Power of Attorney, to South Carolina, that night, so that it would be there in the morning, so they could get this levy released immediately. After this JK Harris would help me repair my credit, help set a budget, etc. I sent in my budget, on January 6th, as requested, with a note that I could probably make it through the month. One of the "welcoming" clerks from the company had told me that the IRS had 30 days to respond to the request to release a levy, and would drag their feet until the 29th day. In the meantime, Mr. Pelle had set up debit withdrawal for payment, for February 1st. I told him that if JK Harris did not get the levy lifted before payday that there would be no money. On February 1st, my account was hit for $176, and a second debit withdrawal of $123, both to an account that had $3.73 in it. On January 31st, I received a package, from my Tax Specialist (which she mailed on the 19th), indicating that I had not turned in all my budget information, which should have included three months proof of all my expenses. I called Mr. Pelle, wanting to know why this tax specialist had not even checked my file until almost 30 days after the power of attorney was sent? It was pointed out that this was my responsiblity, and that there was nothing she could do without this information. (As it turns out, the IRS didn't need this information, because my tax returns are current) I have made phone calls to my tax specialist, sent emails, cc'ing Mr. Pelle, and no one has ever returned the calls or emails. Sixty days from my initial contact with the company, and afraid that I would have another garnished paycheck, I went down to the IRS myself. Within less than an hour my levy was released, and I had set up a very reasonable payment plan. The IRS was actually a delight to work with. The IRS problem is resolved, and their records show that in 60 days, JK Harris & Company had never talked with anyone regarding my account. read more hide
I received a notice of Intent To Levy from the IRS October 2005. I freaked out, and didn’t know what to do. I'd heard ads from JK HARRIS and they sounded as if they could help. I made an appointment for the very next day with JK HARRIS, to meet a representative named Ryan Goolcharan. Mr. Goolcharan looked over the Intent To Levy letter and went through a checklist of my financial information. Mr. Goolcharan told me that by signing Power Of Attorney over to JK HARRIS, I could prevent the levy and that the IRS would not be allowed to contact me or my employer. Mr. Goolcharan also told me that, for a fee of $2100, he would be able to settle my tax debt for less than half of what I owed. I happily paid $500 down and signed a contract for an automatic monthly deduction of $180 plus a $10 processing fee (though I didn’t find out about the "processing fee" till later). I relaxed, thinking I had taken a positive step towards resolving my financial problems, and breathed a sigh of relief thinking that I'd stopped the levy. My first sign that something was amiss was when I tried to contact Mr. Goolcharan for an update on my case was told that my new "caseworker' would be Mr. Huffines. I asked to be connected with him and she connected me to his voicemail. I left a message telling him that I'd just been informed that he was my new caseworker and I was calling for an update on my case. I left my name, ss3 and to phone #s where he could reach me. I didn’t hear back from Mr. Huffines, so a week later I called him again. Mr. Huffines couldn’t really give me any details of my case, telling me that they were just waiting for the IRS to "get back" to them, and that I shouldn’t worry. Then I received another INTENT TO LEVY notice! I immediately called Mr. Huffines and said that I'd been told that by granting JK HARRIS POWER OF ATTORNEY, I'd be preventing the levy and that the IRS would have to channel all communications through JK HARRIS. Mr. Huffines assured me that this was the case and seemed genuinely puzzled that the IRS had bypassed JK HARRIS. Well, as you can imagine, the levy took place, leaving me with only $325 per pay period!!!! I called Mr. Huffines, crying, to tell him that the levy had taken place. Mr. Huffines told me to fax him 3 months worth of bank statements, my most recent pay stub, my tax returns and copies of my rent and utility bills. He said that he would present these to the IRS to show that the levy would cause me hardship and that the IRS would then release the levy. I faxed all the requested information and waited. Then I called Mr. Huffines to get an update. Lo and behold, his phone number no longer connects me to him, but to a Mr. Rhodes voicemail. I explain my situation and leave numbers so that he can reach me. He never returns my calls. I finally reach him and he tells me that Mr. Huffines is no longer with the firm so I recap the entire JK HARRIS story for Mr. Rhodes and he tells me "oh, we can’t stop a levy!", and he chuckles as if I should have known better! He then tells me that I need to re-do my 2001 taxes (the taxes that have caused all this trouble) and fax the completed returns to him before he can take any action. I do this. I leave more voicemails for him, with no replies. Out of desperation, I call the IRS myself. They tell me that they have no record that they have EVER heard from JK HARRIS on my behalf!!!! "Besides", the IRS rep tells me "You don’t need them you can just settle this yourself. They can’t do anything that you can’t do" So today, I call Mr. Rhodes again to confirm what I’ve heard from the IRS rep. He asks "Oh is the levy against you already active?" and I THOUGHT MY HEAD WAS GOING TO EXPLODE!!!!!! This is my caseworker and he sent familiar with the MOST BASIC ASPECT OF MY CASE?!?!?!?!?! "YES!!!!" I scream. "well, fax me that NOTICE OF LEVY, but do it before 4, because I’m leaving early to go to the beach this weekend!" so here I am, on the verge of suicide, on the verge of eviction, the only way I've been able to eat the past week is my coworkers are bring me their leftovers, bless them... and this man from this company that I've already paid $1900 to COULD NOT CARE LESS. JK HARRIS is a huge waste of money. I wish that I had just contacted the IRS right from the beginning...but I was scared and I thought I was doing something smart. I WAS A SUCKER. read more hide

Paid almost $3000.00 over a 12-month period and no work was done... Even a simple tax return was not done correctly, but the major thing for an IRS/tax settlment issue was not done.. It took me calling them after 8 months to find out my entire file had been lost.. However the paperwork for auto deductions from my checking account to pay them did not get lost.. What a waste of time and effort on my part. read more hide
Went to JK Harris with intentions of filing bankruptcy to clear up my tax and credit problems. They convinced us that we did not need to file bankruptcy and put us in their credit repair program instead. After paying over 1500 dollars on a 5600 dollar plan, our car was reposessed and we received an eviction noticed. We ended up filing bankruptcy with a different company just in time to keep our car from being sold at the auction. JK Harris our money and left us in a worst position than we were already in. Even though they are included in our bankruptcy, they continue to harass us claiming that we still owe them 4600 dollars. read more hide
On January 11, I discovered a “pre-authorized” debit was deducted from my account for the amount of $200.00. On October 11, 2005 I met with Ryan G regarding issues I have with my Federal and State taxes. After discussing my options, I choose a plan where my federal and state would be combined I would pay a monthly installment of $88.00 which would be deducted out of my account. When I received a “welcome” call, I was told the contract I signed was only for the Federal and the services would not cover the State. Hence a second visit was scheduled and now Ryan G disappeared and I was assigned to see David W. Mr. W not only fabricated dollar amounts for services, but offered me services that I did not need at the time. He offered a contract for Financial Recovery Services that went along with my state package. Going forward, I signed this contract. I called Mr. W and asked him to void the Financial Recovery Services and re-contract me for the State ONLY. After several attempts, he finally returned my call, assuring me this contract would be VOID and in place a new contract would take its place. ON JANUARY 11, THERE WAS A “PRE-AUTHORIZE” DEBIT IN THE AMOUNT OF $200 FROM JK HARRIS AND FINANCIAL RECOVER SERVICES. I DID NOT AUTHORIZE THIS DEBIT. I DID NOT ASK FOR THESE SERVICES AND THIS CONTRACT THAT WAS NULL AND VOID WAS HONORED WITHOUT MY PERMISSION OR AUTHORIZATION. read more hide
I owe the fed. gov. $6000.00 debt. .JK Harris said they could get me out for pennies on the dollar. I gave them $1750.00 +$500.00 that I was to pay the gov. this was 2003 -- now in 2005 my pay checks are being levied. JK Harris did nothing for me, But cost me a lot of money and a lot of headache. read more hide
I went to the so-called local JK Harris office in Greenville to seek help with tax problems. I gave them a check for $245.00 deposit to start work for me on September 15, 2005. The money was drafted from my account on October 3, 2005. I faxed and mailed a cancellation letter to them on October 6, 2005 because I never heard from a case specialist. After calling several times and never reaching anyone, someone from the review and oversight department told me they received my letter 10/13/05 and I would receive a refund in the mail 45 business days later. I was patient and waited. On November 21 I was told by Jill T (I saved the message) that I would receive a refund by December 16, 2005. I never received it nor would anyone return my phone calls or messages to give me any information. Finally, after calling everyday and dialing different extentions I was told by someone a refund letter had been sent on 12/21/05. When I got the letter it read I did not require a refund because of a welcome call and credit reports were ordered, none of which I received. I want my entire $245.00 back because their services were never rendered. read more hide
I spoke with Curtis in regards to refunding my money of $1100. I initially signed up with JK Harris to help prevent a garnishment regarding an eviction. Not only were they not able to stop the eviction but also said they would not be able to be able to repair my credit which they promised in their sales pitch. So not only did I end up paying 25% of my paycheck for entire year but also the $92 a month charge they deducted out of my checking acct. Curtis only agrees to pay around $462 after I sign a form full of legal jargon and mail back to them. Probably to prevent any legal action. read more hide
I received a letter in the mail in August 2004 from JK Harris stating that they could help me with my defaulted student loan. I made an appointment and met with Rick Hane in the Tacoma office on September 28, 2004. At that time I was assured that there should be no problem helping me with this service. Due to my circumstances the loan would probably be dischageable. At that I time I wrote 2 checks both for $195.00 each. 1 to be paid on 9/28/04 and 1 to be paid on 10/28/04 as part of the intitial fee to start the process. In addition to that I had to set up a direct debit from my checking account for $79.50 each month plus a $3.00 fee for another 10 months. A few days later I got the welcome letter and forms I need to fill out and sign. I returned them and waited. A while later I called and talked to Paige to see what was going on and was told they needed more information from me. I needed to sent in all my tax return information and all my student loan documentation. I mailed them all that information. About a month went by and I hadn't heard anything so I decided to call again. When I called my case had been transfered to some else. They said they never received the information I mailed so I faxed 70 pages to there office. Finally...after an imediate follow up call they were able to proceed. They issued a letter for discharge that came back as not applicable to my situation??? I started getting harrassing, mean phone calls at home and at work. So I called again to find out what they were doing about my case and my case again had been transffered to Jessica. I reported all these phone calls and sent the letters I receiving in the mail to Jessica. I was reassured over and over again that this was going to be taken care of, that they could not garnish my wages..etc.. Jessica then filed another discharge letter in 9/05, a year later, that came back denied as well. In the process of that letter I sent her the intent to garnish my wages letter that the collection agency had sent to me. On the letter it gave a date that this needed to be addressed by. The second discharge letter came back denied as well on 10/24/05. On 11/14/05 my employer received a garnishment. I never received a phone call fron Jessica after receipt of the denied discharge os even a letter. I called Jessica on 11/14/05 and left a voicemail for her about the garnishment. On 11/15/05 I called Jessica again and once again the only thing she could tell me is that my case had been transferred to Gail. When I called and talked to Gail she said there was really nothing they could do now that the garnishment was in place, unless I could pay 3 months up front. So, now I am having 20% of my monthly income garnished and alls what they can tell me is sorry!!!! I have taken the day off work to try to get to the bottom of this and apparently there are no supervisors or management at JK Harris becuase nobody knows who they are. I am so upset that after paying them about $1200.00 it took them over a year to file 2 discharge letters and get my wages garnished mean while the intrest on my student loan has been accruing. I will NEVER suggest them to anyone I know!!! read more hide
I have paid JK Harris close to $1000 and have not had squat done. I've had to send tax papers twice, and nobody will call me back. I've dealt with the IRS and state taxes to try to get levies lifted. I cannot believe I'm paying this out, and doing all this myself....Never again! read more hide
I made an agreement for JK Harris to help me overcome an IRS bill that was not legally applied to me on 11-24-04. After I paid them a fee of $1,250 and doing no research, they advised me to let them get a small monthly settlement payment with the IRS. This was not what the salesperson and I spoke about. In any event, JK Harris received a cancellation letter from me on June 22nd, 2005. They have performed zero work for me and I have cancelled the agreement per the conditions of the agreement. It has now been 65 days since they received my letter and I have proof of delivery from the post office of the delivery. They will not return my phone calls or emails and I want my refund immediately. My Desired Resolution: Because of not performing for me any service whatsoever and obviously "hiding out" from processing the refund in a timely manner, I require a full refund of $1,250 received by Aug 30th, 2005. An additional late fee of $25 on aug 31st and $25 per week thereafter to be added if not paid by that time. read more hide
I enlisted the services of JK Harris to resolve a tax issue I have with the IRS. When I was contacted by them they promised the world, claiming that they can get the back taxes reduced, penalties, fees waived. Everything that people told me was too good to be true. The individual I talked to was a savvy business man on a North Michigan Avenue address and he was going to work the numbers and have all these things resolved. Well, nothing has been resolved except the fact that they have fraudulently continued to take money out of my checking account with out authorization from me to do so. I am completely disgusted that I fell for this. When I have tried to call individuals, they never or weeks later return my calls. You never get a person on the line only voicemail. I really feel that the Attorney General's Office needs to look into these individuals. read more hide
My fiance paid $2400 for an Offer in Compromise that he never qualified for. The so-called salesperson should have been able to determine this from the start. But that is not the way JK Harris works. There were many unreturned phone calls, lost paperwork, and a letter received from JK Harris closing my account before the IRS even made a final decision. After requesting a refund from the 'Review and Oversight Dept' and waitng 45 days, they still couldn't bother to respond. read more hide
