This is going to end of my use of TaxAct. It used to be a cheaper solution to TurboTax. It's not only because of the $40 fees for direct deposit. They also playing around with the pricing. They don't honor discount for continuous users and the pricing is jumping around to confuse you. Basically, other than a GUI, there is nothing special about this software compare to the old paper worksheets. If I pay TurboTax premier then it will calculate my ESPP and RSU accordingly. I paid $20 for TaxAct but I have to calculate by myself for the cost bases of my stocks. Somehow the price hop matches their prediction of 3x profit this year. Well, I would say goodbye to TaxAct.
I have used TaxAct for several years for free, since in Texas there is no state income tax. This year, I completed all the data entry only to be told it would cost me $19.99 to file with itemized deductions. My other option was to take the standard deduction at a loss. Boo, hiss!! I copied my totals from the (non-printable) forms and transferred it to the truly free ones at freefillableforms.com. I will not support a company which deals with its customers in this deceptive manner. There should have been something upfront stating what exactly you get with the free version.
I have used TaxAct (basic) for seven years. I didn't realize how much I took it for granted... until this year. Doing my taxes used to be a breeze, they aren't very complex to begin with, but it was a couple of hours at most. This year was so stressful. Every time there was an update, the shortcut/icon and program executable would get wiped out. I had to re-install the program every time there was an update. (no virus protection was running when I was down-loading the updates, and original install I had full admin perms). The navigation and prompts were not as easy to follow as the previous years, and I also got pop-ups saying I need to buy-up to the deluxe version to complete my filing. I used to point and laugh at friends using Turbo Tax and other more expensive software apps, and shook my head when reading about the bait and switch tactics other "free" tax software was using. I don't use the online version, have always bought the PC download. I would think this software company could handle incremental updates better than this. I noticed at one point they offer a new service during preparation for legal assistance in the event of an audit... maybe they should do a better job of QA. I'm very Brand-Loyal, not looking forward to spending a lot of time trying out other products, but will definitely check this page next year before buying their 2016 version.
Save your money. There is no phone service. Waited 2 days and no answer. Kept saying they were busy. VERY expensive. Put items in my account that were NEVER entered by me. If you use them, call your credit card company and refuse to pay.
I will never use TaxACT again. I did the taxes for my friend, a Native American potter with a very small little pottery business. The input on Schedule C was minimal, yet I was charged their full fee for it - as if it was a huge business with use of home, etc - for it though we were never charged in the past. FREE software indeed!
I have been a returning customer with TaxAct for over 7 years. This year, every time I log in, the website states username and password is incorrect. I call customer service and wait on hold. The website refuses to acknowledge the correct username and password each and every time I log in. Very FRUSTRATING! If this continues, I will NEVER use TaxAct again.
I have been satisfied using TaxACT for a number of years, but in 2016, the product has taken a major downturn. Only after entering your basic information in the free edition do you learn that you can not enter data for forms such as itemized deductions which in past years were available. Then, attempting to upgrade to the required "Plus" edition is a nightmare of confusion with no explanation, ultimately leading to the option of importing last year's tax income information with the warning that this will result in the loss of all entered data! Meanwhile I see they have lied to me, that as a prior customer I get a 20% discount but the "discounted" price is exactly the standard price. A VERY POOR EXPERIENCE WITH A COMPANY I USED TO RECOMMEND. I will never use this product again.
I tried to input dependent information but I cannot. Customer service is very bad. No one there to answer to your questions.
I have been using Taxact for the last 7/8 years. Had no issues. I logged in to access my 2014 returns and the return that showed up was incorrect and said it was yet to be filed. I called IRS and they confirmed I had electronically filed returns with TaxAct. I know the exact the amount of refund I got last year and which IRS confirmed. So basically TaxACT has screwed up my previous year's return. How can they mess up my old tax records. On top of that, they are asking me to refile the 2014 return that I know is already filed. There is darn not a single phone number for their third rate customer service number. I paid this company to maintain my tax records and this is what I get in return? Someone really needs to take them to task. BEWARE: Use Taxact at your own peril.
After reviewing the complaints against TaxACT this year (2016), I felt I should add my thoughts. I have used TaxACT for the past 9 or so years. Great program, easy to navigate, very satisfied for the past years. However this year, navigating through the program was more difficult. Can't seem to log in with my previous log-in and password, as I have done in the past. What change!? They need to go back to the way it was in previous years. Also note the prices have increased. Don't mind paying the higher price, if the product worked as it did in previous years. Did manage to complete my taxes, but it was not as smooth as in the past. Now searching for other sites to do my taxes next year.
I received an email for a free return just to be charged 40.00 at the end of the process. I filed with them in previous years and qualified for a free federal return. They charged me 19.99 for the federal and 19.99 for the state. They are really lying and ripping off consumers with their false advertising.
I have been using TaxAct without any issues since last 4 years, and have been recommending this to all my friends. This year, surprisingly they are charging $19.99 for Federal which used to be free until last year. They also increased State filing charges to $19.99 which used to be $15.99 until last year. Regardless, I went ahead with the tax filing as it has been piece of cake for me using TaxAct, and you know what - first they have introduced so many clicks and redundancy in the software this time, I was getting irritated clicking through. And then my efile for both Federal and State are rejected. I have tried 5-6 times fixing the errors as suggested by TaxAct mails but that has not helped. When I tried to call their customer service, those numbers don't connect at all. I wonder if it is fraud service this year???
Tried all morning to continue inputting my return data. Can't get to my information or get any help, or even get contact information for TaxACT. I have been satisfied in the past. So what is happening?
I work as a Technical manager and found this application to be difficult to use. In previous years, I used TurboTax and H&R Block and had decent experiences, so chose this due to a slightly better price. WHAT A HORRIBLE CHOICE! After spending an hour reversing an answer that was buried in a place that was hard to find (and was going to cost me ~$800 if I didn't find it), I made my final changes and was ready to file. At the filing step, the pricing didn't match the promotional pricing for being a first time user. I logged out and went back to the site where I found the original promo and selected it again. I logged in and now had 2 returns. I opened one of them and saw it was blank, so I deleted it. I then went to the other return and it was also blank! So, I now have no return and need to start from scratch! I sent them an email, but then found this site and realized it's better to cut bait and move on. I just ordered H&R Block from Amazon for $20 and recommend you don't use this horrible product. I should have gone with my gut when I started using it. I was questioning whether my taxes were more complicated than they used to be, but started realizing this software is just confusing to use. What a waste of time!
I have used TaxAct for the past four years. I have been very satisfied in the past. Like most other reviews, I was surprised at the end of the input phase that the only way that I could file was to upgrade. Last year for exactly the same forms the Federal filing was free... This year, $19.99. Last year the state filing was $14.99. This year $19.99. There seems to be more pop-ups for upgrades this year, which is a nuisance to navigate through. This year you also have to enter duplicate information when getting an auto deposit for both federal and state. State address input on most of the screens don't function well. Will be using another source next year... so much for "FREE"...
OMG - I have used TaxAct for the last six years. I am 79 and have no tax liability since 2009 when my husband died. I found it "a piece of cake" to use. However, today I pulled my 2014 tax file, assembled all the required information; set up a new password, etc. and had trouble, trouble, trouble! Could not import last year's info; was locked out several times; and experienced other problems like I just read about on this site... After 3 hours I thought I was losing my mind!!! When I couldn't see whether or not I had a tax liability for the year I was unwilling to put in my credit card information and figured I would have to return another day. I always have printed out both the federal and state returns for my file even though I did not file the returns. I figured I must be too old to do it any longer although I consider myself somewhat computer literate; used to work in a law office where I prepared Federal Estate Tax Returns; filed gift tax returns and rather complicated individual returns. Now I find after being on this site, it is not ME - it is TaxAct... Never again!!! I will no doubt pick up the necessary forms (just a 1040 and Schedule B); fill them out manually and again make copies for a file and it won't cost me anything!!! So, I will sleep tonight and just try to forget my frustration today!
Upon a recommendation from a co-worker I use this site instead of going to my tax guy. Granted the program seemed easy to use, however when it came time to getting my refund I didn't get it. The IRS confirmed that my refund was sent to my back 2/24/2016, waited more than a week and a half no refund. Called the bank, the funds were not sent, the IRS (yes the funds were sent on 2/24/2016). Called the customer service not only were they rude and argued with me that they won't help. Called their "Republic Bank" can't get a live person. Upon request from the IRS and my bank, I logged back into my account and checked to make sure they had the correct information. Checked the information, I have entered it correctly. It have been a complete nightmare. I needed that money to pay bills and repair my car. Now I am stuck and in a horrible situation because this "service" stole my tax money. Never ever use this service. Apparently they steal your money then yell at you when you dare call and ask for it. They don't even deserve a star.
Customer service has not responded to any of my inquiries regarding my inability to log-in to my account. I am trying to get copies of my filed 2015 returns. It appears after TaxAct has received their payment I have been left out to dry. All I get from TaxAct is that I need to change my password. When I change my password it creates another file for another return to be filed. I have sent TaxAct all the pertinent responses regarding the original account: email, last four digits of social and a security question but I get no assistance.
I have used TaxAct for several years without any incident. This year, I have experienced many glitches in progressing forward with the program. I was doing my son's return which only needed to be an EZ form and while entering information, a pop up appeared suggesting that I would need to upgrade based on the information that I wanted to enter. He made no contributions nor does he own property but I just wanted to complete this process so I said Yes to the upgrade. Well they upgraded me to the Plus plan instead of the Basic (which I didn't know until I was finished entering my credit card information) and I was charged $39.95 for the Federal and State return. I'm furious. Be cautious when progressing through this scam of a program. I also tried calling customer service as I was now a preferred customer and the phone was not in service!
I filed my taxes with TaxAct in previous years and was well satisfied this year. I filed my taxes in the Middle of January 2016 and they were accepted the next day. 10 days later I received my state refund and a month later after contacting the IRS about federal I was informed by the IRS that all my necessary EIC documentation was NOT submitted by TaxAct and that I would now need to wait 2-3 weeks for a letter from the IRS then paper file my EIC at my local office and then after that I would receive my refund in 2-4 weeks. I am still waiting for the letter from the IRS and when I contacted TaxAct customer service the only thing they could advise was that I contact a local tax professional in my local area. UNBELIEVABLE!!! I will never use the TaxAct service again.
Really disappointed with the product compared to how it worked and its pricing for the past several years. It used to be $12.95 for a federal return with any of the forms or schedules you needed. Now, after you spend hours inputting data, you get to the end of a section and get a message saying, "oh, that will be another $5 or $10 upgrade if you want to file that form." I won't be using this product again--I'm not sure what other hidden fees or charges are likely to pop up if I try to file within this year--I can't find any of the fees or charges listed on their site. And their pricing materials are misleading--it doesn't tell you for example that you can't even file a Schedule C UNLESS you pay the highest price ($29.95 in my case). The product is no better than it was last year--no improvements that I can see, so it's hard to stomach the increased pricing and being so misled.
I've used TaxACT in previous years because it was an economical way to file and relatively simple. This year based on its advertising it was $14.99 to file but NO! When I went to check out and file, the cost came up as $51.90! There was an additional state tax filing fee of $14.99 and a fee to directly deposit the refund into my savings account through Republic Bank if I wanted to deduct the fees from my return. What a scam. I'd rather refile with a more reputable site and spend additional time recreating my return than pay these scammers. This is bogus TaxACT!
I have been using TaxAct for the last 4 years with no problems. Last night and today I am not able to login to my account to work on my return. I get the message "Hang In There" which never goes away. I actually got someone on the phone and after 1 hour they are not able to tell me what the problem is. I told him I would have to use TurboTax and start over with my tax return and he said okay.
I did my first son's taxes and since he had stock sales the price was $14.99 for fed and $14.99 for state which was fine. I did my next son's taxes with the same info and the cost was $19.99 for fed and $19.99 for state. Why??? Who knows?
I have been using TaxAct for past nine years and never had any issue. This year I tried to contact customer service for several times but each time they kept me on hold for more than an hour - until I finally hang up. Unfortunately it seems they changed their customer policy which will definitely make me think twice before I purchase this software next year. Also, running this software (download version) is much slower than in previous years, not sure why?!
I have used TAXACT for several years and have always been pleased with the ease of use and the results. This year, I noticed a dramatic difference. Several times during the Efile process I got "thrown back" to an initial start screen (for no reason) and had difficulties getting back to where I was. At one point, I had submitted partial VISA card information (for which I wanted to charge what I owed the I.R.S.) and got tossed back to the beginning. Because of this, I had to start the Efile process all over again. Evidently, the first time around grabbed enough of my information to charge my credit card, so the second time through... obviously it did it again. I didn't know that this had happened until the next day when I logged into my credit union account and saw TWO charges waiting to go through. I emailed TAXACT, who says they will get back with me in 1-2 days, but after reading all of the reviews here, I am not holding out too much hope. I am thinking that once the charges go through, I am going to have to call VISA and "challenge" one of them to get rid of it. Needless to say, my faith in TAXACT has been shaken. And I still have my daughter's return to do. Sigh.
TaxACT has two very different products. TaxACT that you download onto your computer; a 5 star product. TaxACT ONLINE; I would give this product ZERO stars. I have used TaxACT downloaded to my computer for the past two years and thought it a great program. When I went to get it this year the website steered to the ONLINE version; so I struggled for days and many hours without success. It said I owed the IRS tens of thousands and I didn't know why. I gave up and downloaded TaxACT to my computer. It has a totally different interface and it is so clear and understandable. I reentered all of the data and was through in about two hours; and I owe a lot less, about 7cents on the dollar.
I have used TaxACT to file my and my husband taxes for the last several years and was happy. My husband passed away this last year so I followed their instructions to file a joint return with a deceased husband and my return was rejected. I was at such a loss as to why it was rejected that I called and a very nice woman walked me through the return and we resubmitted it and it was again rejected.She told me my only option was to file a paper return which obviously I have to do. I could have done this without paying them and I am extremely upset that I went through all the work on their site which was not clear if you have something unusual as the death of a spouse. I moved during the past year so I paid them for 2 state returns and the federal returns that I now have to file by paper. Very upsetting. It seems that the site works fine until you have something different like the death of a spouse and then they are of no use.
I have used TaxACT for several years, and have been very pleased with it---not at all the case this year. The program is very glitchy. It doesn't seem to recognize when I've entered things---it sends me back to previous pages. When I logged back in to pick up where I left off yesterday, it didn't work. It took me right back to the beginning. The guided process that seemed to work so well in the past, is not working well this year. I haven't contacted their customer service and probably won't, based on the other negative reviews I'm seeing. Other tax programs are rated higher than this one, and I will likely go with one of the competitors products.
Never use TaxACT. Customer service is horrible. The amount it said I was getting back never happened. I've been on hold as I'm writing this for 45 mins, all around horrible. I will never use them again. I used TurboTax last year and had no problems. Thought I would try something new and went with TaxACT and regretted it!
When trying to enter my IRS PIN, I hit 'Continue' and a blank box pops up with an X at the upper right. I looked for support to inform or get help via phone and there is no working phone number. I wasted 2 days trying to file with them then went to another site. They also seem to sneak in a $12.99 fee. Advertised as free.
The software is very accurate based on your answers to the questions they ask. However, their "side bar" is not that easy to understand. I originally ordered the basic tax package. However, when I got ready to efile the return, it wouldn't allow me to file. I was forced to upgrade to the next level. I was totally incensed that they had not been more forthcoming about the descriptions of each program offered. Program is a little unwieldy in my opinion. It's a little hard to navigate and get back to a point you want to review without going through the entire interview process again. I shortcutted that procedure by clicking on the form flag beside the amount I wanted to review. Because I am super cautious about personal info, I download the program onto my desktop. I have had no breaches in past years with transmitting my return through the program. Be careful what you sign up for. If you step through their "help" program you'll usually wind up at the more expensive package. Know your needs and choose accordingly. If you have any offsetting amounts, i.e. capital gains, gains or losses, you can't use the Basic. My package did come with 5 efiles. I had to resubmit my return because of an error, so that counted as 2 transmittals. That sucks!
They have links that pop up as you're doing your taxes to expanded explanations of the information you need, paperwork you'll need and the information you'll need to take certain deductions. They prepare state and federal returns at the same time, the fed return is free to file, so I would file fed first, pay for the state when I got my refund. Worked for me. They also keep your files on their servers so you don't have to worry about losing the info. Love that! Didn't have to finish at a single sitting. Could enter W-2s as they came in, save and finish up when I was ready. They have easy to understand explanations for each line available, worksheets to check eligibility for some deductions and credits. No problems that I'm aware of and I used them for the last 8 years before my retirement, still check by filling out a return every couple of years to double check if I have a tax liability on my retirement income.
All the basics are good, but sometimes the questions can lead you unwittingly down complex paths and forms that you don't need to fill out. This is one of the less expensive tax prep applications, but it works very well and is always improving every year. Very easy to use and it allows you to either fill in your forms directly or guided. I've never noticed anything unsecure resulting from using the site. It will log out if I'm idle too long and although that's annoying at times, it makes it very secure. The good thing is that it remembers where you left off at log-out so you don't have to retrace a bunch of steps. You can amend your return using this software now. It's fairly new and you have to still print the forms and mail as there is no eFile for amendments, but you no longer have to do them by hand.
After using Tax Act for 10 years I am through with it this year. After spending 2 hours on a complicated tax return, the pages stopped loading. I kept getting a "processing" screen that stayed blank. When I closed my browser and signed back in I got the same screen only this one said "finding a secure server." I'm not sure my return will be there if and when I finally can get back on, but if it isn't I will be starting over with Turbo Tax. Also, they trick you into thinking the fee is the same as last year (federal free, state 14.99). However it says 14.99 in large print and state-extra in fine print so the fee is actually doubled. The "phone support" is another issue. It is only during "business hours", not when most people are home working on their taxes.
I've been using TaxAct a number of years with no complaint. A couple of weeks ago, I logged in and did my taxes. Went in today to finalize them and file, and it wouldn't let me into my account. After several failed attempts, it locked me out. It didn't ask me any security questions. It didn't send me a verification code. There's no way for me to reset it. I've been on telephone hold forever, and I've been on "chat" hold forever. I feel like I'm their hostage. Never, ever, ever again, TaxAct. Thanks for nothing.
After using TaxACT for the last eight years, in 2016 it was a "D" class experience. After spending several hours navigating and finally completing TaxACT 2016 less than user-friendly program and proceeding to e-file only to learn that the system denied the advertised free Federal filing! TaxACT is only allowing income filers at or below a certain gross income, the free Federal tax filings but they didn't convey that information to its users until after they had completed the work. Everybody who isn't at or below their income threshold are immediately routed to the cost of fees for Federal e-filing long form. TaxACT 2016 insults their customers' intelligence and must think that we aren't cognitive enough to know when someone is attempting to bamboozle us; I'm done. Now I have to spend another two-three hours re-entering numbers on another (yet credible) online tax program. My consolation is that I escaped from the clutches of what appears to be becoming another greedy business using the "by hook or by crook" internet business model.
I'm so upset with TaxACT. They advertised this right on their website: "Plus: Best for itemized returns, homeowners and investors $14.99." "Fast, easy, free tax filing Prepare, print and e-file your simple federal and state (1040EZ/A) for FREE." So, I complete the entire thing, thinking I could e-file for $14.99. I go through a series of accepting terms & agreements based on the e-file fee. AFTER I accept, I'm given my receipt with this itemization: Refund Transfer Fees Tax Preparation Fees $21.99, Refund Transfer Fee paid to Republic: $21.99, Total Refund Transfer Fees: $ 21.99, Federal Return Fee paid to TaxACT: $14.99. State Return Fee paid to TaxACT: $14.99, Data Archive Service (DAS) Fee paid to TaxACT: $, Total Tax Preparation Fees: $29.98, TOTAL FEES WITHHELD FROM REFUND: $51.97. HOW IN THE WORLD CAN YOU ADVERTISE $14.99 AND CHARGE ME OVER FIFTY DOLLARS?? Plus, I've already accepted, there's nowhere to cancel!! I tried to go back and just print my returns, and you won't let me until I've paid. Totally false advertising and the fact you didn't give me my total fees until after I agreed to the terms?! That's just crooked! I shouldn't even be paying to file my federal since I'm under the $62,000 income threshold!!
I had always been pleased with online TaxAct software and had not had any complaints for the last 6-7 years until this year, 2015. I used to be able to chat with TaxAct customer service as well as contacting them by phone for a refund. But now, calling or chatting online with TaxAct is no longer available so I had to resort to emailing TaxAct customer service. They do respond to me but there is always wrong information given in their emails. I filed my 2013 taxes last April 2015 with my username and email but TaxAct say that information is not what they have for my records. So why am I able to go into my 2013 return that I paid for 2 years of data archives with the same username and the email I gave them. I know this because I had to change my 2013 password and TaxAct sent me an email to that same email I told them I had so that I could change my password. I've been arguing with TaxAct as to why would they have a different email on file to access a 2014 program. Also I tried to log in with the information they gave after I answered all their questions and I am still not able to log in to the 2014 software. Instead, it logs me into the 2015 TaxAct website. I try to login to 2014 TaxAct online software and I manage to do it but it says it belongs to my son with my 2013 username and my email. My son does not file his taxes online especially with TaxAct. I truly believe that their system has a glitch or is totally messed up. I would definitely not recommend anyone to use TaxAct online software. I wouldn't even recommend the 1040EZ TaxAct software either. Since TaxAct can't help, I'm done using TaxAct software.
I am glad to see that I have not just lost my mind and that others are having the same issues this year. I have used TaxACT for the last 8 years with no problems. I know that they charge for e-filing state returns and that is fine, but this year $19.95. Really and of course as others have stated do not see that till the very end when you are expecting 14.95 for state e-filing only. I have told so many people about this site and now I am feeling bad and hope none of them took my advice. If they did I am sure they will question me next time. Very disappointed.
TaxACT doesn't seem to prepare tax forms for non-residents, but they don't say that anywhere. I entered a lot of info then realized they had a Georgia amount due listed. I don't and never have lived in Georgia. Sent emails about the GA return and why the amount for ACA was included/how to get it off since there was no telephone number, and no response. Apparently this program isn't going to work, have used turbotax in the past, not thrilled, so will try H&R Block I guess. At least I didn't pay anything.
I have used TaxAct for 10 years - never any trouble. This year has been horrible - I have tried to call numerous times for help constantly busy. Have emailed everywhere for help and no one responds. They tell you they will get back to you in 1-2 days! Really? What kind of online help is this? There is something showing up on my completed return (a casualty loss of $130) that I did not put on there and cannot for the life of me figure out how to remove it. I checked under casualty loss and there are no figures there. Does anybody have a number that TaxAct answers? Does anyone know where I can find this $130 popping up that is incorrect? I would appreciate you letting me know - **! Next Year TURBOTAX! (And obviously TaxAct does not care as I have even emailed the sales office and public relations - no one responds!)
I have used TaxACT to file my federal and state for several years now and have had no issue until this year. They are now limiting free service to 1040EZ/A forms and are charging $14.99 to access the 1040 long form. They then charge additional to file state. In the past they sold their service on information retention and populating fields from the prior year. This year you have to pay a premium for information population to occur... Again, this had always been a free service. TaxACT is of no value to me at this point. I will not continue my service with them this year which is a shame because they had an excellent product, but it's nothing that I can't find elsewhere.
I have been a customer of TaxACT for approximately 3 years. I had small problems before with establishing if filing had been successful. This year has and is still a nightmare. I have been working for 3 days now and still don't know if I have been successful in the filing of my taxes. Yes, I have asked questions and used a lot of paper and ink printing the answers (How to know if your return has been filed etc.). Allow me to give you some events for the last 3 days. First, as a return filer I was required to complete all my basic information although it referred to my 2014 Taxes Import. After completing the Basic Info I was informed that I would have to pay $14.99 for Basic Plus due to one of my entries. I agreed to the charge and continued to providing information as requested. However, before I could provide some of the information the site would time out and close down. I had to reinsert data many many times because of the time outs had erased the previous entry data. I had to sign in again after identifying what was in pictures etc. and continue re-entry the data. This year TaxACT Web pages included MAX REFUND,100% ACCURACY, in their Guarantees and pledges. I assumed all of the advertisements would prevent and assist me from making a very catchable error. I am married and filing separately. I itemized deductions and both of us had around $4000. What a mistake as each of us would have had an automatic $6300 standard deduction. I should have known but had no IRS Forms to check prior to paying another $14.99 before being allowed to print them. Yes, there was a form review on the screen for me to check but blocked with for review only statement. Not realizing the error I had made I continued to work through all of the timeouts with re-entries and information for state filing. Finally, I get to the point of checking alerts and finishing filing listing how I wanted to pay for the Basic Filing Bonus ($14.99) and including the State another ($14.99). I listed a credit card with all the details and it wouldn't accept it. After several attempts and timed out situations, I called a listed number and go an all persons are busy. Finally after working for 2 days on one filing I decided to use a different card that didn't cost TaxACT a processing fee and I think it was accepted. I wish I was finished but since we were filing separate returns I had another to complete. I had discovered my error on the itemized deductions and if one files the other must file for itemized deductions too. At that point I just wanted to wake up from this nightmare and was willing to pay the ($14.99) for Basic Bonus and the additional ($14.99) for State Filing. It took several hours for me to get through the timeouts and reposting. Finally I finished the alerts and owed Federal Tax and was asked how I wanted to pay. I started with Debit/Credit Card. For Credit Card there was a charge of 1.99% and for Debit Card 2.69%. For Bank Draft some Bank in Texas wanted around $20.00 to Process. At one time I thought of Printing IRS 1040 and State Forms and filing. But how long would it take to print the forms and instructions? I know one thing I intend on filing amended forms. I have photos of all the free advertising, etc.
I unfortunately feel glad that I'm not alone with my views on this company. I am in the same boat as the others. My story is the same. I've used TaxACT as an alternative to TurboTax/TaxSlayer etc... And man it is time to walk away. I hardly ever post reviews on the Internet, but if time is money (which it is)... Then it will actually cost you double to use TaxACT. Look up whatever they want to charge you then double it. Because their website is so sloppy and, particularly, their customer service (which you will undoubtedly have to encounter) is so lagging, that you will pay dearly with your own time, and it will end up being more expensive than whatever alternative you had in mind. And if TaxACT is reading this, consider that if your business hadn't so many bugs, I wouldn't have had this long of an opportunity to log on and write a review. Instead, I've got my feet up, totally relaxed, because I know the circus show you're running is going to take their sweet time to get back to me. Thanks!
Last year I used this service - no problem. This year, I went to file my state returns and it said TaxACT was not given permission to file them. This is already mid February, and the error message was about a C Corp. I have an S Corp. SO you can imagine I thought something was messed up. So I tried calling their phone number and got a busy signal. Then I tried for the next two hours over and over, getting through and getting dropped... Basically eventually I got through to someone who told me basically I needed to call the NC state revenue board and tell them to give TaxAct permission to file the forms. THIS IS ALL AFTER THEY TOOK MY $19.99. Can you believe this? They have no intention of getting the state forms, but they took my money anyway... I said "Well, what if you never get permission how do I file my taxes?" The guy just laughed as if I hadn't wasted my whole day with these bozos. I hate them. I hate them. I hate them with all my heart. NEVER AGAIN. I will sing to every corner of the state of NC never use this program. IT's a scam and it's horrible and I hope it winds up in mass civil class action courtroom.
I am having problems with my IRS PIN too, I tried 5 times using the instructions from the IRS. Followed the instructions, entered my PIN, and the same results "IRS has rejected my PIN". Something is not right. IRS system gives me the same PIN.
I've used Taxact for years. I've always liked it. Until this year. I will not use it again. When I started my return this year, it wouldn't remember any info I had entered and had to start over each time. I had to pay to use forms that I've never had to pay for to use. It has been breached multiple times this year, with other filters I know having their ss # stolen and saying the IRS has already received a return for that #. Online help or otherwise is nonexistent. Just terrible this year. Sorry to say I now have to get used to new tax software.
I saw that TaxACT advertised "free" Federal and State tax filing software. When I went to do my taxes there was a $14.99 charge probably because I had 1 schedule to do. I thought the $14.99 was for both Federal and State but after I paid the $14.99 there was another charge for $14.99 for State. Most products will charge for State, but not for both. I will never use this company again. Ripoff.
I've used and have been satisfied with TaxAct since 2008. However this year was DIFFERENT. First of all the same product that I paid $12.95 for had jumped to 29.95, and then after spending 2.5 hours entering my taxes when it got to the point to enter information on Schedule C it said I needed to upgrade. Called TaxACT to see what the deal was and was on hold for over an hour! Then the rep said that I needed to upgrade to "Premium?" If that wasn't bad enough AFTER upgrading it DOES NOT ALLOW you to enter job related expenses into Form 2106. When it asks if you want to enter vehicle mileage and then just skips right over it. I called TaxACT again and was on hold 1.5 hours before I finally just hung up. Went to Walmart and purchased TurboTax and filed my return within 2 hours. I don't know what TaxACT did to alter their software this year but it did not work and does not count all your deductions properly. I will not be using/recommending them ever again!
I have used and help my friends and family in the past 10 years in using to file their income taxes for free (Federal) and this year I noticed that it is no longer free if you Itemized and have self-employed income. I got all the way to the e-file part and stated I had to pay a fee $14.99. I was very upset because I will be trying another company that is free to file and do e-file. I brag on TaxACT for many years but now I do not know what to say.
Been using TaxACT for a number of years. Every fall, get an email to lock in prices before the increase. This year it was $14.99 for file federal and state returns. So I do my 2015 taxes, get all the way to end like in past years and have to pay the fees of $14.95 to e-file. Yep, no problem, that's the price I expected to pay. Then put final touches on the state return and guess what, another $14.95 to file the state return. So it costs twice as much as the advertised price. I contacted TaxAct and get a step by step reply to see the pricing within my account. And of course the TaxAct program shows that it's $14.95 for each fed. and state return. Very deceitful. TaxAct - you got me this year. But never again.
I think this is my fourth year to use TaxACT to file both my Federal and State income taxes. Each year it becomes more complicated, even though I file a 1040-EZ. This time around though the website stated that I had an incomplete Box 1 (Wages, tips, other income) in my State filing, and that I needed to go back for completion. After 4 failed attempts, I finally decided to select "delete" State from the process. Guess what, it then said I had successfully completed both my State and Federal filings. So darn frustrating. Next year (2016 filing) I will use a different company.
I have used TaxAct for nearly a decade with no problems and even preferred it over other consumer software because of its price and great interface but this year I have tried to file more than a dozen times correcting the same EF pin complaint. It tells me that the return is submitted but when I check on it the program says there is no return on file and IRS sends a rejection. I'm moving on! Enough! And forget getting your money back!
They claim it's free but at the very end they surprise you with wanting to pay them money to make things faster. They initially say they are free then at the end they say, "sorry we can't do this, you are trying to access these premium features, pay now." The issue is they should be upfront instead of springing it on you at the end. They are not upfront and honest about what they are charging for. They are just hoping people pay the 10 dollars at the very end for convenience sake. So after a few years using this service, I used H&R Block online. It was a much much better experience. This is only for federal taxes, state taxes I don't have to do.
I have used TaxACT for years and started this year by clicking the free-federal-tax-return button as always. An hour of entering info later, message pops up that because I had a state tax refund last year, filing is going to cost me. They have a right as a company to change their policy, but they didn't change their user interface to help even long-time users understand this, and in the "What's New" section of their intro website, nothing is said about the rate change. That's bait-and-switch, that makes them scoundrels, and that's why I'm writing this.
AVOID USING. Miserable! Have used this program several times in past without difficulty, but this year they have made changes that make it almost impossible to use -- constantly shuts down and requires you to log back in, cannot use computer to look for required data (like addresses) while you are using program, misses asking many key questions, very non-intuitive structure makes it difficult to find where to put key information. Really just a miserable experience. I don't know what happened -- it was fine before. If there is a customer service number, they make it very hard to find.
In signing up for TaxACT and their Bundle Package, I informed the salesperson I did not have an EFIN and was told I did not need an EFIN until January 01, 2017. I was just starting my Income Tax Business adding to my Financial Planning Business, better serving my friends/clients. After filing my first 14 Income Tax returns, ALL FOURTEEN were put in "SUSPENSION" for I did not have an EFIN. In checking the IRS Website, it takes a minimum of twenty eight days to get an EFIN. In conversation with the tech rep, Paul by name, I could hear the shoulder shrug through the phone. After waiting 45 minutes, he asked me, "What do you want me to do?"
I have used TaxAct for years, filing itemized federal tax e-forms 1040, completely free. This year, I got all the way through the ordeal of entering all my numbers, which took me 2 hours. THEN I am told that I have to pay $14.99 because they don't have Form 1040. What!!! I am so angry. Is this legal? I will never use this company again.
I have used TaxACT for over 10 years. I have always been able to use the basic version but this year, they restrict what forms are available and they constantly force you to upgrade to the most expensive version of the program. Very misleading! Last year I filed federal and state for $21 and this year it will be at least $40. I should have cut my losses, but with each new form they charged me more. The user interface is terrible this year. Go somewhere else.
I used taxactonline.com to do my taxes this year and tried to contact them several times through email and no answer. Then there is a phone number that is constantly busy. I needed to know why I could not preview my schedule C and other forms before filing and NO ANSWER. The only form I can see is my 1040. There is not even someone to chat with. It is ridiculous.
I suddenly found I couldn't log into TaxACT to finish my tax return. I learned that you are blocked out if you forget your password a couple times. So I sent emails asking to be unblocked, but it's been several days and still no action. That's enough for me to find another service or perhaps just download forms and do it all myself. Can't submit receipt - they've always charged at the end.
What a pathetic design. I ordered Taxact s/w three times. Each time they assigned new customer number and I had to use different customer number to login. All of them assigned to same email id. The latest 2015 order has new customer ID and stopped working. If I reset the password with email ID that resets old customer number login and no choice to reset new customer id login. Tried to call customer service. The line was busy always. Got up early morning and called as soon as they customer service is open. I am in hold for more than 1 hour and giving "non-sense" message. Clear your browser cache message every 30 seconds... this should be last time I am using TAXACT s/w.
TaxAct didn't disclose any fees except the $30 filing fee. Come to find out I am paying bank fees too. $20 extra on state now waiting to see how much extra for the bank on federal. They said NOTHING on the tax website for those extra fees. I'm getting ripped off! I will never use TaxAct again.
I've used TaxACT online exclusively for years. I was initially able to file completely for free, then as the years progressed and e-filing became the norm, I began paying what I considered a modest fee of $7.99 with an email discount. This year I began my 2015 taxes and invested the usual significant amount of time entering W2s, 1099s, etc. Progressing along nicely, I get to the section where I'm asked about an HSA. Yes, I had one. Oh, well you can't use the $9.99 version; you've got to upgrade to PLUS. Really, because I had a high-deductible insurance plan with an HSA, that's going to cost me $5 more?! So, before you conclude that I'm just a cheapskate, it's the principle. Don't reel me in and get me to waste a bunch of time and then bait and switch! There was no warning which forms were available and which weren't. I'm done with this company.
I have used TaxACT Online for many years. I always use the free version, file my Federal Taxes with itemized deductions, and that's it. It's always been very user friendly and fast. This year, however, they let you get all the way through the return and then tell you that it's $14.99 to itemize. Plus, I was in a seemingly endless loop because I did not want to pay even more to file my state taxes. I finally backtracked many, many steps and got out of the loop. I will never use this company again. I don't like dishonesty or sneaky moves.
We used TaxACT last year. You have to pay to review previous years taxes. When I did this they charged my account twice. After charging my account twice I am still unable to download or access previous year taxes. There is no phone number to call to contact for customer service. This company is a joke. I will never use them again.
I've used TaxAct for over 10 years now, but no longer. Literally the ONLY advantage TaxAct had over companies like TurboTax and H&R Block was that you could file whatever form you wanted for free, and just had to tolerate the constant pestering of TaxAct to buy its inferior pay versions. I am seriously offended that TaxAct would make me waste my time entering in all mine and my wife's tax information only to tell me at the last second that I'd have to pay a $15 fee to file. I cannot stress enough how infuriating it is to me that the average U.S. citizen can no longer do his or her own taxes for free. We now literally have to pay in order to pay the government. I hope that injustice is not lost on anyone reading this review.
I input all my information then hit submit. Upon giving the system time, I tried to locate my return using TaxACT's system. It kept coming back as no return on file. I finally gave up after two weeks and processed my return using Turbo Tax. Got Federal return within 1 week. State within 11/2 weeks. I would never recommend anyone using TaxACT system.
I have used TaxAct for more than 5 years and over the past two years have noticed a disastrous slide. It seems as if Second Storey Software was purchased by another company two years ago. Before that, there was a separate, very reasonable, charge for Technical/Tax support, and telephone response was ALWAYS quick and knowledgeable. Last year, this area started to go downhill really fast. As I write this, I have been on hold for over three quarters of an hour. Yesterday, I gave up after getting a busy signal for more than 15 times I called over the course of the entire day. Last week, I had the same "luck". The TaxAct program has always been an excellent and intuitive one. Unfortunately, if TaxAct does not correct this phone support "problem", they will be out of business in another couple of weeks. That would be really sad.
Ads posted say filing is free including itemized deductions. However, after investing time inputting all information and deductions, software then limits you to standard deduction unless you upgrade for a fee. Hello, THAT'S NOT FREE!
In spite of several, I mean several, attempts, I have not been able to log in to the account NOR reset my password. There is something seriously wrong with their website and customer service is non-existent! BEWARE!
My return is not as complicated as a lot of people, I had one checked by a tax firm and they came up with the same thing. I have never had the IRS send me a bill for something I missed. It's much cheaper than an accountant, but you might need more help if you have a lot of complicated deductions, otherwise it is a very good deal, and most include state returns for free. They have onscreen questions, just plug in the answers, if you have a question the help files are very good. It has all the forms you might need, when done you can print it out, or file online. I have never had a problem with security, have never heard of any problems they might have had. I can't comment on more than that, since I don't know.
I have never been audited?? All my numbers come out accurate as far as I can tell. I don't go around double checking it by hand. I mean that is why I get tax software in the first place, right? I think it sneaks up on you and is a little deceptive about free filing. It tells you that it is free but it charges you for depositing your money via direct deposit. This is very easy to use. Asks a lot of the right questions to try to get you the biggest refund. It flags areas of concern and reminds you to check them again before you file. I have never had any kind of issue with security. There are plenty of security questions it asks you every time you sign in. Blah Blah Blah. Really.
Never an issue in terms of accuracy of results. I did have to seek assistance from their helpline on how to enter information related to an odd item for a partnership. They provided me with the proper answer. Prices are way below other software packages I have tried. Organization of flow is good as are summaries of income, deductions and taxes. Have used their packages for years. You can enter your data in a questionnaire fashion or using detailed worksheets. The flow is logical and follows the best way to enter information as it relates to each type of data. I have not had a security issue with this software but may only have been lucky. This year they have added an extra layer of security to get to the account making me feel better about it. But, is it ever strong enough in today's hacking environment. The Federal and State governments need to tighten up security also, even if it means sending refunds more slowly.
I'm a trained tax preparer, and I first used TAXACT because it was inexpensive. The first two times I used it I double-checked by doing my own on paper. There were no mistakes, and I've used it without worry ever since. It's easy to use, and it has very incisive questions so I can get the most money back or pay the least, whichever the case may be. I also like that I can view previous years entries to compare. TAXACT is a great value. Electronic federal filing is free, and the state filing is very inexpensive. I've used it for quite a while. It has value in another way -- I don't have to keep all the worksheets and papers at my home since TAXACT keeps all my information. TAXACT is very simple to use, guiding you every step of the way, and asking questions when you're done, indicating where there may be a problem and asking you if you need to change an entry. I don't really know about the security. All I know is I've never had my tax information stolen in all the time I've been using this program.
Last year we had problems. Once we finished the document, we were unable to file it, ended up having to print it off and send it in that way. We figured something was wrong with the system. Don't know if we'll use it this year or not. Have no idea, we couldn't submit it online. What more do you want us to say? We did it and couldn't submit it. Read what I wrote, ** it!! :-( Easy to use UNTIL one tries to submit it. Nothing else to say here. That part sucked big time!!! No idea!!!
I have been using TaxACT for many years but I am really disappointed with their products for 2015... I paid more than $1000.00 and at this time the Business forms for New York State are not available. I called them many times to ask when they will be ready, and nobody know!!! All other tax software companies are ready and I do not understand why it's happening.
I have used TaxAct for 2013-now. Before that I used TurboTax, which I loved but they had changed their business model by charging more and limiting the number of returns one could e-file. Since I was doing mine, my girlfriend, plus all five of my kids' returns, I needed to be able to e-file more than five. At any rate, I didn't ever really like TaxAct as well as TurboTax, but once I had swapped over I didn't want to swap back so I stuck with it. But each year I yearned for TurboTax. This year pushed me over the edge of heading back to TurboTax, for the following reasons: TaxAct is clunky and hard to use. Jumping around to go back to some other items is a nightmare. The explanations aren't that well done. Then come to find out, the forms that I need are not included. I had to pay to upgrade to PLUS right in the middle of doing the taxes. So I did but it was a huge hassle because it doesn't seamlessly let you pick up where you left off. I eventually managed to get it installed and worked my way back to what I was doing. I finally get to the end of the Federal and State return, put in all of my direct deposit info and credit card info to pay for filing the state. I finally get to hit the E-File button and guess what? Can't make a connection to TaxAct. I had to go through the "select e-file" process each time I wanted to retry. Still not able to connect to TaxAct. Now that irritates me for two reasons. One is that I wasted so much time trying repeatedly (never did succeed). The second is, why does it have to go to TaxAct in the first place? Shouldn't it be going directly to the IRS and the state? At any rate, I just spent a very frustrating day off, all day, to not get my taxes done. Thanks TaxAct. I won't be using you next year. (And to think, I could have simply taken my documents down to the local credit union and had them do it for me, for free. I used to be a VITA volunteer doing other peoples taxes for free, so I know they do a great job. I just like the control of doing it myself.)
I am disgusted that they changed their format for the 2015 tax season. I have used this company for YEARS and recommended to everyone I know. Sorry to see that they are now charging for everything except a 1040 EZ yet still advertising free returns. Disgusted. I am not usually one to write reviews but I hope this company gets shut down for their bait and switch tactics. I now have to warn everyone I previously recommended!!!
As a small tax return prep business I've been using TaxAct's professional package since 2000 and have purchased it again for 2015 taxes; this will be the last time I ever use TaxAct. I've seen their customer support go from bad to non-existence and software go from easy to use to mind boggling. The final straw was after purchasing the preparer's package plus state package. I found the current version (2015 taxes) will not allow me to e-file my clients returns since I'm running Windows XP on my principal computer. Nowhere was I made aware that current version would not run on XP and after numerous e-mails to customer support was told I'd have to either upgrade my operating system or buy a new computer. My answer to TaxAct - I may have to upgrade my computer but it sure won't be so I can run TaxAct, I'll be looking at other programs and worse case will go back to doing paper returns and no e-filing.
TaxAct was never the "best" tool to use -- it was clunky and had a horrible user interface, but it was one of the very few programs that allowed you to file many of the forms for free (in fact, for the past two years, they've released a press release touting that very fact!) When I went to file my taxes this year, as soon as I got to the Schedule "E", I was prompted that I needed to pay for the upgraded version. Why TaxAct would change the ONE thing they had going for them is beyond me. If I'm going to have to pay just because I have rental income, I'd rather pay someone else -- a site with a MUCH better UI (user interface), customer support, and brand recognition. Whoever made this marketing decision should be ashamed.
I am a tax preparer with 9 years experience. Well Jan 19, 2016 kicked off my 2015 tax service opening. Only to find out my taxACT account had been hacked and several of my clients have been rejected, stating their social security number had already been filed, forcing them to do paper returns. This is a nightmare. I in turn began to call taxACT for 4 days straight and not get an answer until yesterday. I also learned through google and Facebook that there was a security breach in which several clients information had been stolen. I am very upset. I will NEVER use this software again. They are saying it's my computer but during off season, I store my files on a flash drive securely stored.
Used this tax service last year and actually wasn't bad, filed federal free and state was 7 or 14. Forewent the state. This year I come back to file the same forms, same jobs, same kids, etc. Suddenly I can't see last year's taxes without paying! This free privilege expires, because I guess that's how you gain loyal customers right? Btw the site claims IRS charges 60$ for tax transcripts, ummm try actually FREE through their website. So why would I pay to see that! THEN you have to pay 9.99 to populate last year's valid info on the new tax return, please explain why that has to be a charge just to make you do this all over when they still have all your info from last year? If you file both state and fed that's 19.99 to get your info populated. Hmmmm, why is there an option to accept advertising from other sources to solicit you during this return? On top of that it suggests accepting this makes a difference in your price.... No it was still 19.99. Okay we got through all that BS to the part where you must pay your balance upfront with a card, for some reason paying this fee with your return money makes them have to give you a loan through republic bank which is... wait for it... 19.99! WHY? I don't get that at all, why do you need a loan? This site needs to be looked into. I'm pretty sure some of this isn't legal. So 40.00 poorer and much wiser, TaxACT won't be getting another penny from me. Just use the IRS efile, keep YOUR money.
I received a promo # to get their services for free. When I visit the site, I am unable to find out where to enter the code. I have looked everywhere and the only thing they ask for is my bank account info. I don't think so. I'm going to look for another company. I have used TaxACT in the past with no problems. They need to get it together.
I have never taken the time to write a review about a company nor a product. But, after my experience I just had with TaxAct this evening, I am so livid that I can't help but write this review. First- I'm trying to obtain a copy of my 2013 tax returns. I have used TaxAct one time and that was the year that I used them. It has been utter HELL trying to obtain this copy. I was on the hold for 27 mins the first time I called before speaking to a woman who did nothing but talk to me in a rude demeanor and cut me off with each of my sentences. (We ended up hanging up on one another.) Second time I called, the representative was a little bit more helpful but it seemed I had some other hoops to go through that the last representative never even informed me of. The third time I called, just truly did me in!!! I spoke with a representative who was first off NEW, (yes he told me this) after I had been on the phone for 53 minutes waiting for SOMEONE to answer. He was also extremely rude and not the least bit of help. He kept putting me on hold and began raising his voice at me once I told him I wanted a refund that I was "required" to pay for my 2013 copy. I bluntly told him I would never be using TaxAct again in which I got a "chuckle" in return. DO NOT USE TAXACT!!! WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!!!
I have used TaxAct the last few years because of bad service from TurboTax. I started filing my taxes at 10 am this morning. Was just about finished when it timed out as I was entering information. I tried to get back in and it would not let me back in because of password issues. I tried two times to create a new account and each time the code that was provided was not accepted. I tried emailing and calling for over two hours and could not reach their customer support. Finally got back in to the program by accident and was entering bank information when the same thing happened. When I tried to get back in it would not let me sign on and let me know that since I had logged in so many times they disabled my account. I wasted five hours of my life trying to enter my taxes and now I have to go to someone else and do it all over again. Their customer support is terrible. It took forever to get any help and I still was not able to file. I cannot understand how a company like this can stay in business. Do yourself a favor and do not use TaxAct.
I have used TaxAct online for many years now with no problem until this year when I tried to file my 2015 taxes. WHAT A NIGHTMARE! It used to be so simple and easy to use, I was astonished to find that now it was full of repetitive pop-ups and new restrictions in order to force you to "upgrade" to one of their multiple new paid "premium" levels. This year things that used to be free, like direct deposit, importing previous years information, and even definitions/advice on life events, are now only available after you pay to upgrade. Just this morning a coworker was trying to convince me to use TurboTax instead, and I said no because I've always had an easy time with TaxAct. Well, today TaxAct has convinced me to use TurboTax. Free e-filing - LIARS!!!
I have used TaxAct for several years and this year has been a catastrophe to sign in and process my 2015 taxes. I am so fed up with their sign up system that I will do my 2015 the old fashion - long hand. Their support system is a disaster - no telephone number to call. This electronic filing system is a joke!!
I tried TaxACT for the first time this year, because it was less expensive than the product I have used for the last 10 years. The process was not as user friendly, but still worked. Today I receive an email that my return has been rejected because a return was already filed this year. It appears that I am victim of the tax return fraud I have heard about on the news. I never had this with the other product. Reaching a person from TaxACT for support is non-existent. They do not answer their phones and make the phone prompts as difficult as possible to allow you to reach a person. I will never use this product again as I cannot support companies who to do support their customers. I also wonder if they have a lesser level of security that allowed this fraud to happen. I am on hold with the IRS, with a message that my hold time will be 30-60 mins, and that this will delay my refund for up to 180 days!
The only reason I gave it one star is because 0 is not allowed. My daughter -- full time student with a part time job had to pay $50 in hidden fees. Total Ripoff STAY AWAY!! Taking advantage of a poor full time student.
I've been using TaxACT over 7 years with no problems. This year I filed my taxes electronically as usual and got a surprise. I had to upgrade and pay $14.99. I've been filing my taxes the same for 7 years with taxact and has never had to pay. It's suppose to be free. That's not where it stops. My final cost to use taxact was $39.00. I had to pay additional money to a bank called Republic Bank. So my free E-file with taxact costs $39.00. I can only imagine how much it would cost if it wasn't free. I will not be using Taxact in the future and I'd advise everyone else to do the same. Unless you like being lied to. I thought the word free meant no charge. Well TurboTax, you will have a new client next year.
I have filled out my taxes and followed everything they said to do. I get my federal done. Go to finish state. A alert comes up saying box 1 don't have my wages. I go back and check. It's there. But yet they keep popping up that same alert. And that's not all of it. Every time I sign on they say they don't recognize my site. Then they send me a code. I put it in and then they don't recognize that. I'm fed up. I have used them for 4 yrs. And never had this kind of trouble. I will find another provider. My advise is don't use Taxact!
I've been trying to figure this out for days - since the 19th. All it is is a simple pin issue apparently, but nowhere is there a way to simply change it. I've already paid with my cc too and gotten an email saying my return was accepted, but it wasn't. I log back in & it still asks me if I want to continue where I left off. And when I try to go forward or back anywhere it just keeps going to the same error message. Even says I may need to file via paper (which I'll be po'd about if that's the case!). I'm so upset/frustrated that even though I've been using TaxAct for several years now (I always selected a different pin before but didn't think it really mattered), I am never using them again & going back to TurboTax from now on. You're SOL when it comes to support & answers to technical issues. Only reason for the 2 stars is if you happen to do everything perfectly then it works well (there is no warning or message to select a new pin that you haven't used before). I used to always give them an A+ saying I'd highly recommend them. Not anymore. Highly disappointed. I will be back with an update when I finally figure out how to get this resolved; when I called them the next day I was told they pretty much didn't know what I was talking about & to just log in and try again. Right. Oh AND it may be a coincidence, but now my computer that I've had for several years won't turn on now (happened when I turned it on for the first time after using the site & it's NEVER happened before) which is where I saved the copies of my return. I'm having to use my tablet now! So hence is why I can't verify that I bought the ** product.
I have used TaxAct Preparer Edition Software, for more than 10 years. For the 2015 filing season, TaxAct made significant changes, and have made the software a nightmare, for the user. TaxAct support has thus far, refused to fix the problems, and will not refund the cost of the software. Do not purchase TaxAct.
I have used TaxAct for a couple of years with no real complaint. This year, the only thing that changed on my return was an increase in income, but from identical sources as last year. After putting in almost all of my information, it tells me I have to upgrade because now I need a form 1040. I do not need a 1040, as I filed the same info last year with them (different amounts) with a 1040A. Only my income changed, so that tells me that when you hit an unmentioned income limit, they arbitrarily require the 1040, which costs. It wouldn't bother me if they had stated that before filing, but after spending a couple hours trying to fix everything & then finally input a brand new return, I realize it wasn't data entry. I'll gladly pay more to be cheated by an upfront company.
I e-filed my 2015 Federal and California tax returns with TaxACT. Both the Federal and California returns were accepted within 24 hours. I also paid the tax by credit card through TaxACT. TaxACT uses a third party to pay taxes and this third party charges a fee. This was fine with me. What wasn't fine was that TaxACT's third party never processed my credit card payment, and the temporary credit card authorization dropped off of my credit card account several days later. Also, when I went to check on the status of my returns, if I checked through one site, they were listed as accepted, but when I checked "My Account" within the TaxACT site, I could find no record of the returns ever having been filed. After speaking with several TaxACT representatives, nothing was settled except that the tech support guy told me that both returns had been accepted. Nobody I talked to at TaxACT could tell me why their third party entity, that is supposed to process the payments, hadn't done so. Also, nobody I talked to at TaxACT even knew the name of this third party company. In fact, all of the persons with whom I spoke at TaxACT sounded completely confused and incompetent. I finally repaid my taxes through the IRS website, and am now waiting for that payment to be processed. I would advise anyone who is contemplating using TaxACT to reconsider, and use another tax preparation site. I paid for the Premium version of TaxACT so that I would have tech support included in the fee. The people who work at TaxACT, from my experience, are completely incompetent and also really don't care about the customers. Updated on 1/27/2016: The TaxAct mess continues to grow. I filed my taxes by way of TaxAct on January 13th, 2016. The IRS decided to start accepting returns a few days early (January 19th had been the original date for accepting returns to begin.), and my Federal and State returns were accepted a few hours later. I made my tax payment through TaxAct using their payment processor, Value Payment Systems. The pending payment showed up on my credit card account for several days, but then disappeared without ever being processed. I waited a few days longer, and when the credit card payment through VPS still hadn't processed, I then called the IRS, and had them show me how to make a credit card payment through their website using Pay1040, which I did since I assumed that VPS's payment had been dropped. The payment through the IRS was processed in 24 hours. I thought everything was done with my tax payment. Then on the morning of January 26th, two weeks after making the initial payment of taxes through VPS, I got an e-mail from VPS saying that the IRS had accepted the payment through VPS. On the evening of January 26th, that payment processed on my credit card. I have had to call the credit card company and instigate a dispute on the payment to VPS. What a headache. My credit card company, by the way, thought that taking two weeks to process a credit card payment sounded pretty irregular. I also called the IRS again, and explained the situation, that I had paid my taxes twice. The IRS representative assured me that either the credit card dispute through the credit card company would go through, or else the IRS would refund the duplicate payment within 4 to 6 weeks. The only good thing about all this is that I won't be responsible for paying the amount of the duplicate tax payment on my credit card during the dispute... Nor will there be any interest charges on that amount. I did call TaxAct again to complain about all of this, and as before, the representative I spoke to was completely clueless about all of this. I asked how to file a complaint, and he suggested talking to the TaxAct administration people... But of course he had no contact information for them. The TaxAct customer service reps are completely incompetent. Before this year, TaxAct also used Pay1040 as their credit card payment processor, but this year went over to VPS. My guess is that VPS is cheaper for them. I will, of course, be filing my taxes with some other company than TaxAct next year.
Was doing my taxes. A box pops up and kicks me out of site. Can't log back in. Call support, they say clear this and do that! It don't work after 20 mins. on my cell. They hang up and I am still locked out WTF!!! Somebody HELP ME. DON'T USE THIS SERVICE.
I attempt to file my 2015 FREE 1040A online tax return, entered all the information and when I selected the option to file online, and direct deposit, it indicated the fee was $14.99 and asking for credit card information. All I have is 2 W2's, nothing extra. I reviewed the return to make sure everything was entered correctly. Only forms of income is from my W2's. I HATE SCAMS. I WILL NEVER TRY TAXACT AGAIN!!! Now I'm having to reenter all this over into TurboTax, which I should have used instead of TAXACT with all their extended offers!
TaxACT advertises FREE filing for Fed and State if using 1040EZ or 1040A. I go through the process of all the questions, etc. then TaxAct states that I do not qualify for free filing. I do qualify for 1040A -- not itemizing, etc. After searching their site I can find no way to ask question as to why I do not qualify. They apparently do not want any customer contact. I have used TaxACT before, but will never use them again as I feel they are not upfront and honest with their advertising.
I tried to order CD software. I could only get to the checkout then it sent me to sign in then I was in a loop and could never get to the checkout page again to get it ordered. Customer service could not help me. This has happened for two yrs. No more for me.
Can anyone tell me how in the world a company can shut down their website just because it's not "tax season". People need access to their files all the time -- not just during tax season. Ridiculous!!!
For 5+ years I have been able to file for free since NV does not have state tax. Just started entering my info for 2015. IF YOU ITEMIZE, IT NOW COSTS $14.99. Popup window informs you that "Itemized deductions are not included in TaxAct Free, so you'll need to upgrade to TaxAct Plus to claim itemized deductions to file itemized deductions. Upgrade to TaxAct Plus for only $14.99 more. Pay when you file. State additional." Sorry guys, you just lost a customer.
I have used TaxAct for a couple of years, but this year I filed my taxes late. TaxAct charged me twice. I call and they said it was for state and federal, but it wasn't - I had already filed my state. After talking with 2 people they refunded me for the extra charge, so I mentioned to one of the reps that I mailed my 1,040 because it said it was rejected! The rep told me that wasn't true, because if I was charged it was E-Filed. Today I talked with the IRS and was told that after a certain date you can't E-File. I called TaxAct back, and I was told that it was a fee to E-File. If it was rejected I shouldn't have been charged. I will never use them again!!!
I've used TaxACT since 2001 but this year I'm going elsewhere. They have changed the product names so you can't compare to the one you used last year and try to scare you into upgrading to a more expensive package than you need. Did they sit around all year trying to figure out how they could pinch more money out everyone using confusion and smoke and mirrors? No thanks, not my kind of company anymore and I'm sorry I hadn't bolted already. The only reason I'm here leaving a review is there is no place on the website to contact them with questions or for clarification. POOR customer service.
TaxAct is very poorly managed, no support and after many technical issues, I got to what I thought was the end. I paid the requested amount, charged to my card, but did not allow me to view or retrieve my completed tax form.
Filed taxes with TaxAct several years. Just got a notice from IRS stating I owe 1912.00 for a mistake on 2013 taxes. Emailed TaxAct, they said not their fault, I had filled out 2 1040's. NOT CORRECT. The site has glitches and you have to go back and fill in items. When I did so it doubled the amount claimed on my mortgage interest. Their excuse was I sent in 2 1040's. What kind of idiot would do that. Why didn't a red flag come up stating so. Then, in response they send an email for me to go to site and look at tax form filed. OK, so I go there and can't retrieve my 2013 form. So, I email them again. Their response was to pay to view it. What a joke in reputable management and responsibilities. Then to not allow me to view what they SAY was my error is absurd. In the end it cost me $1912 to IRS which would have been nullified if their software had caught the mistake in the 1st place. C'mon man, do your customers right.
More than half way done with my 1040 that has to be submitted by tomorrow, screen says timing out... Continue? I hit yes.. It goes to log in screen. I log in with same info I've had for years... "We do not recognize your information" in red appears. I key it in again... Same thing. Again enough times to get locked out for 15 minutes. It's been 45 minutes now. I feel right now their Secure Access is not so secure. I truly feel I was just hacked! I'll know soon enough! TaxAct will not be used in this office again!
I've used TaxAct before and didn't run into any issues. This year I entered all the information I had and made estimates on some things that I would need more time to work out, and then filed the extension. Procrastinator that I am and knowing I was due a refund, I waited until October to get around to finishing the rest of the work. But when I logged into TaxAct, my work was completely gone! Nothing there AT ALL. So now my taxes are due in a couple days and I have to find all my W-2's etc. and enter everything again from scratch. This is a particular issue for me as I suffer from medical issues that make being on the computer for any length of time difficult so it's a lot harder for me to bang out my tax return in just a couple days. TaxAct not only has caused me major inconvenience but trusting them to properly save my data is going to cause me medical issues for days. One things for sure, I will NEVER trust them with my information again.
I have literally spent hours today filling and refilling out forms. My information did not import from the 2013 tax form, except for a few basic things, such as address and forms. Far worse was the fact that the program froze constantly or booted me out. Folks, I have a two month old Apple. I even tried two different browsers. Sometimes windows wouldn't open on menus. Other times the whole thing just shut down. It's unbelievable. It's 2015. Not to mention the instructions don't make a hell of a lot of sense either.
Filed online with TaxACT and had all the troubles mentioned in most of the other complaints. Tried to get a copy of my tax return that I filed and saved on my pc and it will not let me print, nor is the file there at all. And doesn't recognize my name or e-mail. Convenient on their part because now they ask for a fee to retrieve the information. How can they retrieve the info if they don't recognize me to begin with online? I will NEVER use this so called service again, not worth a penny, nor all the time it takes to do this online only to have the IRS send me a letter that I owed $1,483.00 after all was said and done. I paid the IRS in a timely manner but for a senior citizen to have to pay that on limited income is over the top. TaxACT should be put out of business before more people get ripped off over their deceptive trade practices.!!
I have used TaxAct software to file my taxes for the past 3 years (2012, 2013, and 2014). So far, I have been audited on 2012 and 2013. All I have done is answer the questions that the wizard asks, and it is supposed to "correctly" calculate your taxes. Also, once you are finished, TaxAct is supposed to verify the information and alert you if there are any serious mistakes that might trigger an audit. My 2012 audit prompted me to look at my return, and I discovered that TaxAct had calculated my deductions making my adjusted gross income $5,000 which was nowhere near correct. For 2013, I had acquired rental property, and TaxAct had me enter the rental expenses in as expenses. It never prompted me to set up a depreciation schedule, and not being familiar with the 27.5 year depreciation rule for rental properties, I entered my payments in as expenses. Hopefully for 2014, I will not have that problem because I set up a depreciation schedule for the property, but only time will tell. The program is fairly easy to use if you know what you are supposed to be doing. But, there could be a better system of checks and balances built in to it. I mean, with a gross income near $70k and an AGI of $5k, I would think the program should have alerted an issue such as that. I most likely will not use TaxAct for 2015. I definitely would not recommend TaxAct to anyone I like. Oh, and they want to charge you for questions you might have while filing your taxes.
I did my taxes with TaxAct.com for the first time. My state and federal came to me with no problem. Though today I received an electronic deposit of $300, I am worried that it was a mistake because I didn't get a letter or email of why. I just would have liked an email of why. I don't want to spend it and then have to repay it because it was a mistake.
Received notice from IRS that corp Form 1120S and individual Form 1040 tax returns for the years 2012-2013 & 2014 had not been filed and was assessed penalties by IRS for failure to file tax returns. When I contacted TaxACT I was told that TaxACT could only locate one extension. Requested and suggested that maybe I had e-filed the tax returns with another service. When I forwarded copies of TaxACT Notice of Acceptance by IRS of the e-filed tax returns, TaxACT responded that more time would be required to "research the matter". During the past 10 years, I have had problems with TaxACT but never on this scale. IRS has filed liens assessing penalties and interest. My only recourse at this point is to file a lawsuit against TaxACT since their only response was nonsense.
Like many, I got sick of Turbo Tax raising prices so I tried TaxAct. It was the most horrible tax software I've ever done. It left you hanging. It didn't prompt you for everything. I had some forms in front of me, but couldn't find where to enter them! TurboTax never did that to me. I elected to pay by credit card and gave them my credit card number. Got my emails saying everything went through... Then, guess what? Two months later I get a letter from the IRS saying my tax was never paid! So now I have penalties to pay. I come to this site and see that others say their tax wasn't paid either.
I did my federal for free with TaxACT and then my state, I didn't have a charge to pay the 19.99 fee. My husband had it so I tried the next day and all my information is gone. REALLY! I have to start over. We are both senior citizens and can't afford to pay much for returns. It is a hard site to navigate and it took me over 3 hours. But I guess I have to deal with them again but never next year!!!!
My wife and I filed for an extension of our federal tax return. The next day we received an email saying that the application was rejected. The initial problem was that my wife filed the return using her married name but her Social Security # was linked to her maiden name. Easy fix... Great! Just change her last name on the form right? Nope! We patiently followed the links in the email and on the website. The links are easy to follow because they all say "FIX MY RETURN NOW" on each page. Well once we got to the part where it pulls up our return/extension form nothing happened. A window popped up saying, "gathering e-file..." but the page never opened. It was the weekend and we kept the program running for three days and nothing changed. Customer service wouldn't be opened until Monday morning. Today we called customer service because we were still not able to pull up the form. The rep walked my wife through the exact steps we had previously followed over the weekend. The program still never pulled up the extension form. After several attempts with the customer service rep on the phone and it still not working my wife asked to speak to someone in Tech Support. The rep then informed my wife that it would require a fee of $8. As soon as she paid the $8 by credit card before Tech Support even got on the phone the screen unlocked and magically our return/extension form popped up on the screen. My wife changed her last name in the required field and resubmitted the form. The customer service rep then tried to tell my wife that we needed to pay our federal income tax immediately and when my wife questioned her on this issue and told her that we just filed an extension the rep hung up on her. It cannot be a coincidence that our return popped up as soon as the charge went through.
For the second year in a row I went through the TaxAct Forms wizard to completion and chose every option offered to file electronically and pay the amount owed to the IRS. Additional charges for this come up at the end and you expect everything to complete once you select and accept these offers. For me, once again, this was only half true. The filing portion worked but the payment portion did not. This big problem as I file my returns in March and just expect that I am finished paying my taxes... Last year I walked off thinking my one-stop shopping for filing and paying my taxes was all wrapped up only to receive a letter from the IRS later in the year telling me that I not only have yet to pay my taxes, but summing up a hefty tax penalty for not payment of taxes. This year I went through the same process, except that I made it a point to verify my credit card payment along the way. My scheduled payment was prior to April 15 and it never appeared. I checked again after the 15th and still nothing, so I went direct to the IRS website and paid them directly on-line. I went back to my confirm emails from TaxAct and verified payment, "Payment Type Credit Card" was there as expected. When I called TaxAct last year to inquire as to why their product didn't deliver what I paid for the exchange that I had with the agent was a classic, well-executed Customer Service dodge and customer pacification, without the slightest possibility of any type of resolution or acceptable explanation. She went into my account and just basically recited that, "Yup, I can confirm that your filing went through just fine back in March..." stepping through a few other worthless details of the transaction. Whenever, we got onto the topic of the payment she simply patted me on the head and directed me to the IRS or just simply left the implication that "Yeah, your taxes were due by April 15, you should have paid them and you wouldn't have gotten the tax penalty." She was really well trained and handled keeping things cheerful while providing nothing helpful like a real pro. This year, after shadowing the progress of my payment after filing I ended up paying the IRS directly. After not only paying for the additional charges for filing and paying, but also after having purchased an upgraded version of TaxAct itself that actually claimed to do everything. I did not even bother to call them this year because I know what to expect. TaxAct tax form fill itself is competent and has good ease of use. I have been using it for at least 5 years now with only these last two delivering the horrible results. They are OK to fill and file, but just take it straight irs.gov once you have filed and are ready settle up and avoid the misleading TaxAct Up-Sell that doesn't deliver. IRS itself is a more trustworthy and reliable entity than TaxAct, hopefully we are nearing the day when you can just enter you information with them and truly get the complete result from a single source.
If I would have known how much TaxACT and Republic Bank charges I would have never agreed to it. In fact when I did my taxes and had my state sent off it said that I would only be charged 9.99 per state return so why did they charge me 57.00. That is crazy. I will not recommend them to no one. Thanks for ripping me off.
Went to do my Federal taxes, using the free Taxact software. Succumbed to their heavy handed marketing, and "upgraded" to the so called "deluxe" edition. Was never able to download the software, nor file the free version. Numerous attempts at contacting TaxAct were useless, culminating with the call back yesterday from one of their morons who stated "what do you want ME to do?" And she then hung up. The worst customer service since the days of Dell computers fiasco, with obvious tech issues that they are refusing to address. My advice -- get out a pencil and do the forms old school-- much less aggravation than dealing with TaxAct and their gang of incompetent idiots.
TaxACT online keeps "shifting" me to TAXACT DELUXE which costs $12.99. It's doing it right now, and it did it last year. At which time I paid the $12.99 because it was 1130 April 15. I do not wish to pay that again, and feel I must suggest to others to find a different "free" tax filing service that charges $12.99 or MORE at the end.
TaxACT says it has a free version, but unless I have completely missed it somewhere I just spent the last couple of hours only to find out that I have to pay $24.95 to print or file my taxes. This is rich as I have no taxes to pay, am not receiving a credit or a refund. Don't waste people's time. Just put the cost up front your users AKA suckers can then decide if they want to use your service. I have used TaxACT in previous years when I had an income to declare and was happy to pay. I am assuming I will have an income next year but I won't be paying for a copy of TaxACT, you can be sure.
I filed both State and Federal returns earlier in the year and arranged a date of April 13th 2015 to have the funds taken via automatic debit from my bank account. It's April 15th today and the funds have not been withdrawn. I sent TaxACT "customer service" a message and they sent a lame generic issue message saying basically it's not their responsibility and I'd have to call the IRS and State myself to see what the problem is. ON TAX DAY. I never had a single problem with TurboTax for over 10 years - they will get my business next year. TaxAct is cheap and you get what you pay for. Never again.
Well I don't really know how to start this but I did not know what this company was or that it even existed. I was checking my bank account a few days ago and there were some charges on my account that I was not aware of. I called my bank to ask questions and they gave me the customer service number which the lady I spoke with told me there were three separate charges made to my bank account which I knew. She told me I have to send a email to CV manager about the charges that were made and they would give me a FULL refund because I did not use this service or even know what it was. I sent the email and canceled my bank card which will take 7 days to get. Has this happened to anyone else? People check your bank accounts. These people can't get away with this. I want answers and a refund.
I've been using TaxACT for about the past 10 years with no problems. After several hours of trying to get this done this year, I finally just went for the extension so I can try to find another tax preparation site to finish. The problems: The site "times out" after about two minutes of activity, so if you need to do any calculations, it will time out, requiring you to log back in. But it doesn't bring you back to the same page; you need to navigate through countless pages, again, to get back to where you were. Very frustrating and time-consuming. I got an extension for the federal, but went ahead and filed the state. $27!!! $10 for filing the state, then they added on another $17, saying that I still owed them from last year! What? If I owed you money, why not let me know prior to this? I decided to simply print the "free" state return, but "free" apparently means $10 to these jackasses. No customer support. Yes, they have links all over the place to contact support. Good luck getting a real person to talk to. I am a retired gov't employee, my pension is my only income, nothing complicated. But it literally took me over six hours to navigate, and re-navigate, over and over, the same things. Just totally frustrating, like they went out of their way to make this very difficult. Well if they don't care about their product, I won't either. After about 10 years of satisfactory results with TaxACT, I will never ever use them again.
Previous complaints are spot on. To add to this I have experienced that the info links when clicked on, go to totally irreverent information. It appears the quality of service continues to decline yearly. It makes no sense to continue doing business there.
I have been trying to get back into my forms so that I can print them, the program will not allow me to print my tax forms nor will it let me back in so that I can complete my state taxes. I have paid in full. The customer service was no help.
Last time I used TAXACT it charged me for the deluxe version even though I NEVER checked the box for deluxe. I spent days trying to find out how to contact them and finally was able to get a hold of them. They say there was nothing I could do to fix it. I had to pay the price for the deluxe version so I could file my taxes. This year I made sure I had a witness watch me do every step of the return. Guess what, once again I am being charged for the deluxe version and there is no way to reverse the process and get only the basic. I once again have to pay for a deluxe version that I don't want and did NOT request. Beware.
I did my taxes online with Tax Act Online and I ended up owing the IRS for my taxes. I go to hit file electronically and Taxactonline says there was an error processing. I go into my profile and try to file there but tax act says I already filed and couldn't file again. I go into my profile to try & pay for the amount I owe to the IRS but it once again it said 'error'. I have tried calling numerous, countless times and the 312 3 is always busy. I was charged the $17.99 fee from Tax Act to file but they didn't actually file and because they said I didn't file (even though my profile says I filed), Tax Act Online still didn't accept my credit card payment. I had previously used Tax Act for quite a few yrs and no issues but because of this major issue before my taxes are due, this has caused me a lot of work to manually complete and file my taxes and now my taxes may be late, which in turn will be more money I lost because of them.
To start with, I used TaxACT in my 2012 return. Seemed OK then. However, 2014 TaxACT tax preparation is a nightmare story. My dreams about a quick, efiled tax season were dashed by TaxACT. Exaggerating? HARDLY!!! My first problems were with trying to fill out the 1040 information and supporting forms. It was like trying to use Windows 8 all over again. The problem is that where in all tax forms from any government there are blanks with lines showing you where you should write in the information. In TaxACT many data entry screens give absolutely no indication that this is where you enter data. The screens look like some kind of summary of some kind without the data. Keying in tax return information was a time consuming hunt for many data entry locations. With the latest edition of TaxACT there are a few obvious places for data entry, but there were a lot of things like name and address with no obvious places to key anything in. You have to move the mouse around AND click as you search in order to get a "blank" to appear --- like for instance, there will be a screen that says "name" "address" "city" " zip code", etc. Since this information has already been keyed into system before you get to this point, I never suspected it had to keyed in again. With no hint of what was needed, I found this complicating the situation considerably. It took me a couple of days of poking and pecking just to figure out that what appeared to be an information section was actually a data entry square. Very irritating and time consuming to say the least. That was shades of Windows 8 which bombed on the market for having very similar design problems, causing people to (including me) to absolutely hate the highly lauded Windows 8. Other problems were that the menus were very, very hard to figure out compared to Turbo Tax which is much, much more intuitive from my experience. It was also very, very difficult to navigate "back" to an input screen to correct errors, for instance. Often, by the time I spent several minutes searching menus, I couldn't remember exactly what it was I had to do, or exactly what the problem was or exactly what a number needed to be. The worst part was trying to figure out why I had to pay over $1700 in state taxes. Every year, for ten years or so, that had never happened. TurboTax always calculated it correctly. It is not a lack of experience that was the problem. I have been doing my taxes for over 50 years, and I used to do taxes for the men in our company in the Army. So, the worst part was trying to figure out why TurboTax, in 2013 and in previous years, told me I had no taxes due, and TaxACT persistently and reliably told me my taxes were around $1700 with over $400 being in fines! After a day and a half of going through my Federal return over and over and over, looking for an error, (which is where the state information was transferred from), I left the Federal tax section and went to the Michigan TaxACT tax program. I found that the Michigan TaxACT program was not designed to accurately compute my state taxes. I used to work in a software company, so I was in sort of familiar territory in hunting down this problem. After spending a few hours going over 2013 and 2012 returns and comparing forms with 2014, I finally figured out that TaxACT failed to handle my age properly. Had it done so, I would have received the proper deductions I needed to have an accurate form Mich1040. When all of this was said and done, I decided that even though I paid to have the state 1040 emailed, I had to do it manually. As a final shot at me, I did make one mistake on the 1040 before TaxACT emailed in my Federal Return. When I corrected the error, TaxACT thoughtfully informed me that I owed them another $21 or thereabouts to TRY to efile my return again, with no offer of a refund for what I paid for and never received (I paid to have both state and Federal returns done by the efile method. No, I could not figure out how to contact them by clicking on "contact us" and looking for an alternative method of contact for about 10 minutes. Finally, after an exhausting 3 days or so, I mailed both my Federal and State returns. Very, very, very happy to be rid of TaxACT for good.
Today I went to TaxACT online to do my income taxes for 2014. I signed up & did my tax on their site. When I was finished the price came up of $14.99 for this service. I went to TaxACT because the AD said $12.99 for State & FREE Federal return! I decided to pay the $2.00 extra for this service. When I gave them my credit card number & was approved they continued on to my state return & THEN I saw a fee of $10.00 was being charged for this return. I did NOT continue because I thought this was a fraudulent & misleading Ad. I don't know what to do now because they have my $14.99 & the tax deadline is in 3 days & I STILL don't have my state tax filed! I tried to contact them BUT could not get a email address or phone number on their site. Please let me know what I should do about this company & do I have a case against them. Thank You.
TaxACT website Infected with Trojan virus, CryptoWall. When I downloaded the tax program, a notice popped up along with it that said all of our files were now encrypted and will not open. I closed the message and ran my virus scan. I worked for hours on the tax return, and noticed my computer was very slow. None of our files would open. This virus gets around your virus scan. I had to run the scan in Safe Mode in order to find it and delete it. But all our files, photos, etc. are corrupted and will not open. This type of virus demands you pay a "ransom" to get encryption code. We will have to bring our computer to someone to take it back to factory settings, but we lost all documents and photos. TaxACT refunded our money, but would not compensate us for any of the lost time, data and expense.
After completing taxes and filing, federal were rejected because of pension account numbers not matching theirs. I checked and rechecked and contacted my provider to verify the account number and it was ok. I re-sent it several times to get rejected. No telephone numbers to talk to agent of IRS. I finally took my taxes to HR Block at a cost of $300 and a $400 lower return. Not sure what I will do next year.
I've spent the better part of 4 hrs just trying (at my son's request) to get to where he left off, doing his taxes. It is truly a nightmare keeping my login information (from where I did my own taxes yesterday) from interfering with his return. Incidentally, my own return is completed for Federal and State. So why in heck does it want to put me into my own account instead of letting me log into his return.
I completed and printed my tax return for 2014 about a month ago. Today I got an email from TaxACT saying the return is unfinished because it was never submitted. Nasty surprise. Here I was, wondering what was taking so long for my tax refund to come in! So I clicked on the link to pull up the return and submit it, and guess what? I can't log in! I remember feeling unsure when I finished the online filing with TaxACT because I never saw a clearly visible button saying "submit". Instead, at the end of the process I was bombarded with promotional/irrelevant reading material and I assumed that printing the return was a way of submitting the return. The "submit" button, TaxACT says, is somewhere in there. You just have to hunt for it. I will not use or recommend this company again.
I have been waiting for my tax refund to go to my bank since 2/6/15. It is still not there. It has said processing for a long time. I'm just about ready to give up. I will never use TaxAct again. I have never had any problems doing my taxes till now. Very disappointed in this service. NEVER AGAIN!
I had to go back to correct something. After that I had to start over. 3 hours of this. I authorized to pay out of my refund but they still asked for my credit card. I couldn't cancel the form. Now they have my SS number and banking information. This has to be the worst company for filing. Bastards better not charge me as I never got to the submit button.
Have been trying to get into TaxACT to do our taxes. We used TaxACT last year, it will not let us sign in as a returning customer nor let us sign in as a new customer. We are very frustrated and time is running out. Also I cannot find a number to call for customer service to talk to a live person.
I have spent the better part of three hours trying to get things right - wrong. I went in and deleted an extra entry for the same amount. They added it in anyway and now I am showing more income than I had -- I can't cancel it. Thinking about cancelling their 12.99 charge supposedly free. Ha and the extra $7 for state ---NEVER AGAIN. I tried to see what my tax return entries were but kept going back to other things - complicated and borderline evil.
I used to use TaxAct online. For 2014 I used the downloaded version. After submitting our tax return and receiving a successful response from the IRS, I ran a what-if test (nothing like our normal 1040). The result produced a mathematical error: on the last few lines of the printed 1040 it subtracted 7,883 from 9,488 and showed a result of 1,618 (rather than 1,605). A $13 error. Now I worry about the actual return we sent in.
I have used TAXACT.com for about seven years. I have not had any problem nor has my filing ever been returned because of an IRS problem. However, today I received a call from a man who said he was from the IRS and I owed over 3000.00 in back taxes due to several mistakes on the forms. When I ask what some of the misinformation was he just said, "Contact the local IRS office." I ask for an address of the local office, but he refused to give me any information and promptly hung up. I suspect this call was a scam, since I have not received any from the IRS in writing. I have reported this to the IRS office, and am waiting for a reply. Be careful, don't give any information to the caller. If there was a problem, I feel sure TAXACT or IRS would have contacted me by mail.
I had already filled out my taxes using H&R Block program, but couldn't file electronically. I would have to mail because I was "over the 5 limit" - so I sought out TaxACT because I wanted to file electronically. As I went thru each page, the final - was not accurate! It showed refunds of less because it didn't take the property tax deduction! Could never figure it out. I was forced to pay big money for the also faulty TurboTax, which costs $100 - but at least it was accurate! DO NOT USE this.
I efiled my Federal and State return on TaxAct on 3/2/15. When I logged in to see the status of my filings the message was efile not received. I emailed TaxAct support over 10 times asking for clarification and all I got was that my returns were filed. On 03/12/15 I finally had to resort to calling them at a $7.99 fee. I got a manager that finally sent me the email stating that I may have been a victim of fraud. I then received the email stating that I should contact the IRS Fraud Department. Really 10 days after I filed? They offer no support, just evasive email responses forcing you to call and get charged. NEVER USE THEM. THEY ARE FRAUDS.
After completing the online... yes... FREE service for 2014 Fed and State I was offered at the end to utilize their direct deposit service. They said it was $19.95, took my cc info charged my account and a day later said, "Oops, we can't do that!" After trying to get assistance that never came had to cancel my card, reject that charge and damn near take them to the Supreme Court for help. Ended up doing by hand and all is well. STAY AS FAR AS YOU CAN FROM THESE SCAMMERS!
I have used Tax Act for a number of years but never have had so many frustrating problems. Almost every time I login the system will time me out stating that I have been inactive even though I have been entering data. Other times it will not let me enter a legitimate on-screen option that is highlighted, for example: yes no, where one of them is highlighted. This year's version is extremely frustrating. With all of the stop pangs a requests that I login again I get the uneasy feeling that I might be responding to a hack!
My wife received e-mails from TaxACT regarding account creation and confirmations of successful income tax filing actions. However, my wife never did business with TaxACT - instead, someone else mistakenly typed my wife's e-mail address during account creation, and TaxACT does NOT validate those. Because of this, my wife received notices about the other person's actions, and potentially revealing personal information. We were able to determine the name, birthday, and state of residence of this other person. If we could guess their city of birth, we could completely access this other person's TaxACT account, and potentially steal their identity. TaxACT's "Security Center FAQ" has the below entry regarding this problem. However, shouldn't ANY e-commerce system perform simple e-mail address validation? Duh! Why am I am receiving emails intended for someone else? It appears someone may have mistyped their email address when registering their account or entering the email address to receive notifications about their electronically filed TaxACT income tax return. Our system checks an email address to make sure it is in the correct format. We have no way to verify if an email address entered by a customer is indeed their own. This makes addressing this issue somewhat problematic as we have no other way to contact the customer who has entered the email address incorrectly. Please contact us and let us know of this issue. We will remove your email address from their account to prevent future emails from sending to your address and note the account to alert the account holder to correct their email address.
I began ONLINE but encountered the limitations of NO preview of form until purchasing Deluxe version. I evaluated the options and purchased the Ultimate DOWNLOAD version with State return. After downloading and installing, I found NO WAY to obtain my ONLINE data for use in the Downloaded version. I phoned Customer Support and the agent CONFIRMED that you cannot transfer data between Online and downloaded.
I entered all of the data as required and it looked ok until I did the comparison to last year's return, then there was an additional interest income of over $1million that was not anywhere on the forms. I didn't want to file it with bad information and tried to print out the files -- I only get a script error when I try to print. I tried to reach Tax Act to ask "WHAT", but I can't find a phone number anywhere. Reading the rest of these reviews, it probably wouldn't help. I will have to go elsewhere for my taxes!!!
Efiled on 1/22/15 and efiled my tax returns. It is now 3/17/15 and no refund. Both state and federal were accepted. Can't get an answer from taxact. Anyone else having this problem?
They took 600.00 out of my account. Told me to file a dispute. I call everyday to check if they have received it but update on my dispute form. They said to wait for the call. No call yet. I hope a lawsuit takes place soon. Our hard earned money goes on this PayPower prepaid card. Don't use PayPower to file your taxes.
Beware!! It may be cheap..... but you definitely get what you pay for here. Upon trying to get some help with the form 4562 I searched high and low for some kind of tutorial to walk me through filling out that form, the website is horrible to navigate, then upon calling the company, I first have to go thru a list of 20 questions just to verify my identity (and each time I called no two people asked the same questions!). Then I was told I had to through to "Tax Preparer Support" and that was an additional cost so I paid for that then I was told to "hope for the best." However the real THE ISSUE is on multiple occasions when trying to get through... I was on HOLD FOR LONGER THAN 30 MINUTES PLUS!!! Ridiculous customer support. Will not be using ever again!
Efiled on February 11th 2015 was accepted that same day. Today is March 13th 2015 and still haven't received my federal refund. It says accepted and being processed. 9/10 people receive their taxes back when they e-file and go with direct deposit, which I did over a month ago. I used TaxACT last year as well but received my federal taxes in two weeks. My state taxes are scheduled to be processed by March 18th 2015. I contacted IRS and was told if I don't hear anything by April 15th 2015 contact them back.
Ok I had my brother in law do my taxes and this was the site he used. Last year I used H&R Block and got my taxes super quick. This year on the other had is a completely different story. I had him do them and they got accepted and sent kind of but when it came to receiving the money I still have not seen it. The IRS SAID that it would be deposited in my account on March 2 of 2015 and I still have not seen my taxes yet. I am getting pretty pissed off with this whole situation.
In 2012 I filed my income tax through TaxACT. My daughter, who was a full-time student @ the time, also filed with TaxACT. The problem is that I used my daughter and received an earned income credit. Now two years later the IRS has taken my refund and said that I was not suppose to be able to use my daughter. I did answer the questions to make sure that I could use her. Don't understand how since we both filed through TaxAct why the conflict was not caught, either by the IRS or TaxACT, but that is not helping me now that the IRS is on my case. They now want me to pay $2500.00. Thanks TaxACT, you got paid, the IRS will definitely be getting paid but I will be paying for some time to come. Very disappointed with this product. Wondering who can I get to help me out in this situation?
After using TaxAct for 10+ years and never experiencing problems, this year went to crap really fast. First I discovered by accident that one button indicating I was not of retirement age (I'm 100% disabled receiving disability retirement from the State of Tennessee). Considering all the pop-ups and alerts, the program should have been able to discern that I was only 48 and question why the button was not checked considering retirement age is 65 in most states (at least that is what I think). That one discrepancy on my 2013 taxes cost me over $3,000 on my tax return. Now I am going to have to file an amended return. Thank you very much TaxAct. This year is even worse! After importing last years taxes to save time inputting basic data, the program gave me an Obama Don't Care Premium Tax Credit of $840 to help with health insurance premiums. I did not even notice this as I entered all our data from the each of the tax forms we received this year. I did manage to check the retirement age box and was surprised to find that we were getting $6,780 this year. I finished going through the programs pop-ups and ran the alerts. After being assured everything was correct, I e-filed my taxes and received an email confirming they were accepted by the IRS on February 11, 2015. The following week I filed my son's taxes and he received his refund in four days while we were still waiting for ours. Then on Monday, the IRS "Where's My Refund" website changed from the normal screen I had been seeing for weeks to one that said they were still processing my return and they would advise us of a refund date at a later time. With no indication of why the delay, I called TaxAct to find out what was going on. A huge waste of time!!! After being on hold listening to a machine for thirty minutes, the customer support specialists collected every bit of verification data possible and then continually repeated "we have no information once the IRS accepts the return" to all my questions. He could have told me this before wasting my time with the verification process. Finally he did give me an 800# for "Where's My Return" which only offer the same info as the website with no option to speak to a live person. It was then that I began searching for an answer in my return. I did not find the anything suspicious on the Obama Don't Care Premium Tax Credit of $840 until after I started over with a blank return and inputted all the data from scratch. I am guessing this is the reason for the IRS delay. Does this mean I am going to be fined or imprisoned for trying to cheat on my taxes? Is there anything I can do to fix this and get my actual return? As a disabled Vet, my return is very important as I need it for my property taxes! Plus, I don't like the feeling that I did something wrong when I always try to do what is right and have never tried to cheat on my taxes. Any help is greatly appreciated!!! Thank you, take care and may God bless...
TaxAct took our money and never filed our taxes. We were unable to go back and check the filing. We also were not able to pull up past taxes.
Taxact charged my credit card immediately even though the e-file was rejected. I have the first time home buyer credit from 2008 that requires a yearly payment out of my refund. Taxact asked about this but did not properly deduct so now I have to file an amendment which I have never in my life had to do. Really upset about this and it appears my only course of action is to file an amendment.
I have used TaxAct.com before for years, it was fast and easy to prepare step by step. It was cheap and let you print your returns many times you want even if for few days after you have filed. However, this year simply did not work well at all. It gets break down too many times in middle of preparation. It was very hard to get to the end to file them. Even if you file your return, the website tells you that you haven't printed and haven't filed your tax return. It doesn't let you to print your returns. Again after you have filed, it ask you to continue and file them again. It's very very bad experience this year. I wont even try it next year again. Stay way!
I used TaxAct for the first time this year and will be my last due to they suggested paypower to use because I do not have a bank and paypower took 4 weeks to send my card and took $67 of my refund.
Taxact’s computer glitch (they admitted it was their fault) cost me my direct deposit. It makes me furious they "guarantee accuracy" but when called on it, there is nothing they can do. Pathetic. Don't use this service, it's crap and if you have questions they charge you to talk to someone on the phone! BEWARE!!!
I've used TaxACT in the past but this year very disappointed! Filed my taxes 1-23-15 and still no refund. They took their 14.99 out of my account right away and now it's in a system error? Really!
Card was issued. On the 1_30_2015. And I still haven't received it yet and then it's my money but I cant get but $500 a day, that's not fair. And they said, "Have to pay $25 dollars to get another one issued". I don't think that's fair to me when I've never received the first one.
Spent 1.5 hrs entering tax data into the alleged "free" web. At the end it wanted a credit card. You see, it's 12.99 fed + 7.00 state unless you want it free THEN it's $19.99. FRAUD. I spoke with MIKE at TaxAct and he said there was no information under my name, BUT he knew my security question?? How, if the data wasn't saved? This after I had already given Casandra my cc # before I was transferred to Mike who wanted to argue with me about my time spent entering the data and how he worked at AT&T in Basking Ridge. I'd rather hand-write in my taxes and use snail mail rather than deal with someone whose only interest is "schooling" me. The "help" format was useless and you could NOT review your entries on the 1040 and Schedule A. Do NOT use this "service", it's a FRAUD.
I have 3 different problems using TaxACT. First, I filled everything to the end where it is ready to electronically submit my taxes and it kept saying I had to sign a form for this bank to give me money. Then it wanted extra money for using it. Well, I knew that it is free to put money in MY account electronically, so I was so confused, spent a while trying to figure out what the heck they were doing. I finally went back many pages and caught where they MISLED me into thinking that was the thing to do. After wasting much time, I carefully got it finished correctly. Now my second problem, I have no idea where my taxes are. I electronically filed them on January 21, 2015, and today is February 14, 2015 more than 21 days and NO taxes. IRS has only Received it, but hasn't approved it yet. My State taxes were done same time and they just got Received, why so long? I am sure it has to do with them, because I have always received them quickly with HRBlock internet site in years before. Except I did use TaxAct last year so I could just bring up last years. Sure wished I went back to HRBlock internet. My third problem with TaxAct is when I get on the site it goes somewhere other than at the end, and it wants me to go through all the questions over again and signing forms again. It won't let you see everything I have done without filling out questions and signing same forms over and over. Now today, it won't show the electronic status. It is so bad. I wish I had never used it, but how would you know unless you do the whole thing and find out this? And I want to tell everyone to not use it!! And I wished that they had told me.
I have used TaxAct free for three years now and this year it seemed to operate differently. I started doing 2014 taxes and with all the pop ups/the way they explained, I ended up entering all info just to find at the end I had to pay. So, I closed the program and began again - with difficulty and finally understanding to watch and opt out of the Deluxe part. My taxes were filed and I received my refund direct deposit, no problem. Now I'm trying to figure out how to cancel out of the Deluxe which keeps sending me messages. From all the comments made - I believe I will go back to Turbo Tax free next year.
Submitted my taxes and was rejected due to IRS pin#. Tried again rejected again. Was double charged. Ended up printing and mailing instead of e file. Same thing happened last yr, submitted several times printed and mailed for same incorrect pin. However charged only once. Hoping for a 17.99 reversal. The customer service line - can't get through either.
Do not ever use tax act.. we used them before and my mother in law filed for us, everything was fine but this year.. we filed and I put my new bank info in sense I had moved and did my own, everything checked out alright, my info was accurate I made sure before I submitted it, I was checking on irs.gov and it said the refund was sent to the bank, 3 days later nothing was in my account so I checked taxact again and it had different bank info in there on my return copy that I did not put there. We checked the routing number and found out what bank it was. Gave them a call and they said the account was inactive. So going to have to call the IRS tomorrow and see if it can be fixed. I am not sure if it was some old info or what but this was a very frustrating experience I never had when I did my taxes prior years before with turbo tax.
I just filed my federal tax return and now see that the software Taxact failed to add all my retirement income. It left out 2 1099Rs and now I don't know what to do. Help! Should I go in and try to correct this or should I just wait for the IRS to find the error? Will I go to jail? LOL
TaxACT's Support staff is completely incompetent. I tried to access my 2013 return to verify my identity so I could e-file my return for 2014. Every time I tried, I got asked a security question about what city I was born in, and every time I would answer correctly, I would get an error message. I am completely unable to file my 2014 taxes now as the Support staff is absolutely no help. I started a live chat with a TaxACT agent, and after I explained my problem, she logged off and left me hanging! Stay AWAY from this service! Most unprofessional service I have ever used! If I could give them negative stars, I would!
Tax Act charged me the $17.99 for state and federal taxes last year, but never e-filed my return. I did not find out about it until now! I luckily saved my tax return, so I have it to print and mail in, but I was charged for a service I did not receive. I have emailed them and am awaiting a response. I am not hopeful that the issue will be resolved. I have called EVERY number I can find online; all I get is a busy signal EVERY TIME. I will not use this service again, nor will I recommend it.
Like many of you, I have been using Taxact for years (10+, for me). After filing for 2013, I just received a letter 3 weeks ago from the IRS letting me know that I have a tax "Credit". They received the monies I owed for taxes due but I had NOT filed my Federal Taxes!!! I contacted the IRS because surely this was a mistake because I had copies and print outs of my transactions. To no avail, there was no record of any filing and penalty fees will incur!!!
I paid 14.99 for my state tax return and the federal was free, but I need a couple copies for my files and for tax credit. I can't get them to print out. I can't get them to come up on the screen so I can see them.
I did my taxes through them this year and they are EXTREMELY misleading. They say they are free and then they charge you for State tax forms AFTER you are done. Fine, I screwed up by using them, but now, even though I've completed all the questions, agreed to Efile and to have their "state fee" come out of my refund, I still can NOT make a copy of my State form to have for my files. Heck, I don't even know for sure they have filed anything yet and don't provide a way of verifying it. I'm sure glad I did this early so that in 3 wks. I've received no refund, I'll refile elsewhere. DON'T USE THIS SITE, YOU'LL BE SORRY.
Filed 2013 federal and state taxes using Tax Act online services, paid fees to Tax Act, authorized electronic payment of additional taxes due. Tax Act did not file either return, did not transfer funds, and DID NOT NOTIFY ME THEY HAD FAILED TO DO SO. Received notice from California Tax Board one year later informing me no state return had been filed for 2013. Called Tax Act to find out they didn't file the federal return either. On my way to a tax accountant to get this mess straightened out, no doubt at substantial expense plus additional tax penalties. You've been warned!
I've used TaxAct.com before, and it was a good experience. This year, however, the Web Site simply doesn't work. I wasn't able to enter a simple college tuition information - don't think I would trust this site with anything more serious. No Customer Service on any kind - no chat, no email, no phone number, no technical support - nothing! From my experience - this is the sure sign of a bad business. Stay away from services like this! Don't say I didn't warn you.
Saw the comments by Z in Brooklyn, NY. Like this reviewer, I was also preparing my return online with the free user version. I accidentally hit one of the pop ups that made me a deluxe user. I would not be able to submit my return unless I paid to file. I spent several hours preparing my return. They told me I need to start over now to use the free edition. Like the other people on this site, I doubt that this will restore me as a free user. I'm thinking of telling the Ohio Attorney General's office about this scam, as well as the BBB. Do NOT use TaxAct. It also took me 5 time to provide my user information before she began to help me. Sounds like they have no intention of helping. This all sounds shady to me.
I received a RD-108T Supplemental Vehicle Trade-In Sales Tax Credit Form. Their software didn't have anywhere to put this credit. I tried to search their help topics but it isn't there so I try to click for email help. It just puts me back at the review topics page. They seem to be unreachable. I've used TaxAct for years - looks like I should go somewhere else.
The website offers free tax preparation and at the end they charge 12.99 for federal and state they charge 7.00, unaware that doing an itemized return they charge a fee and you don't know till the end.
I filed my taxes with TaxAct for my husband and myself. We have a VERY simple return. In school, two jobs. THAT'S IT. Four years later, I got audited and billed $3200 from the state and federal. I looked at the copies of my return, pulled out our W-2's, did the math, everything was right! After a LOOOONG battle, guess what happened? TaxAct's system submitted our deductions and income just fine but not my husband's EIN and personal info! Say what!? YES! There was a glitch in their system that looked fine from the surface (copies), but the actual info on my husband and his job wasn't submitted! Just his income and deductions! There was NO WAY we could have known this. Literally the strangest event even a tax pro had seen. TaxAct would not respond, to date. Federal agreed and state agreed it was their system error.
I have used TaxAct's software for many years and have generally been satisfied with it. Some form are hard to find how to open. They ASSume you know where the supporting forms are. This years install is very bad. A lot of the forms and fields are in very small text (unreadable). Nothing I could do with Windows or with the software would change this. I called and had to pay for a year's support only to be told that they had changed the script (writing) of the program this year and THEY could not help me. I was instructed to call Microsoft to see if they could help, or maybe do a Google search. Duh!! He said they caused the problem, but it's my problem to find out what they did wrong and how to fix it. What arrogance! He told me they created the problem, couldn't and wouldn't help me, and made me pay for that service. So, I ask. Should I or you be doing business with these people?
Tax Act confirmed they filed and paid my taxes but they did not. I have the evidence. Then they never told me they did not send in my payment or taxes. They had no problem sending me emails the following year to use their service. The IRS and State of MD fined me for not paying my taxes on time. Tax Act ignored the complaints and made no effort to respond or correct the situation. They do not care about their customers, just your money. Run away from them!
The "FREE" service is NOT free. They will charge you a "retrieval" fee to look at your return. DO NOT USE. The customer service is fumbling and incompetent.
I filed my 2013 taxes using TAXACT paid the fee to have it processed and thought nothing else of it until I received a letter from the IRS stating they didn't receive what I paid. I went back to check the credit card statement and found TAXACT took out their money but that was it. I had a copy that I printed with the information that everything was processed. When I call to complain I get no help and I'm not paying TAXACT anymore money to fix the problem they've caused me.
I filed my Income Tax Report with Tax Act Software and I am a seasoned Tax Payer, so checked all the information online before I submitted it but I did not check the finished print out as carefully. I received a letter from the IRS saying information on my return was not complete. I checked my printed return and found missing information that I knew I had added. I am now resubmitting the information to keep from paying a steep penalty and underpayment. I have always manually done my taxes and let the IRS proof it and then submit it. I have never had a problem doing that. I will never use Tax Act again. This is so irritating.
The same thing happened to me... I went through all of the steps to efile and it took me all the way to the end where all you do is sign out. After getting concerned because the funds I owed were still in my bank account, I inquired and it said the return had not been filed. I called and the rep that I spoke with was really NOT helpful. It sounds like this was not an isolated incident. I've found that this is likely going to cost me $150 in late pay and late file penalties, so I will keep this as a reference because others seem to be having similar issues. I've used TaxAct for years and this is the first time I've experienced an issue.
I used taxact last year & was ok with it. Used it again this year & kept getting the "deluxe" offer pop up while filling out my free federal edition. It kept popping up inhibiting my ability to finish form in a timely way so I finally clicked on it because the window said it was risk free & that you can opt out at end, or so I understood. I didn't use the deluxe features since I don't have any investments or property or kids or anything (barely have income!). When I got to the end, I found you MUST pay for it or just lose all the work you have done (took all day to get through it). I closed window & went back in through the link for the free file edition, but once logged in, I was just back to the same thing w/ paying fee - only way to get the file in. On top of this, you can only get access to your tax forms later if you pay fee. I paid the fee for that too & filed - paying for deluxe federal, separate fee for state, & separate fee for future access to my taxes... I then emailed customer support explaining how I never wanted deluxe & what happened asking them to look at my access to site, so they could verify I didn't use any "deluxe" stuff... I got the response back of no refund because I chose deluxe & if I wanted the free edition again I should have restarted the free edition. Nowhere is this info given on the site or are you told you cannot go back to free version only pay or just lose your hours of work. You cannot resume free version w/in your ongoing completion of form but would have to start all over again w/ new username, email, etc... If you knew this was an option, that is. Either stick to your guns & don't let the constant pop up wear you down, like it did me, or just use one of the other programs. I can't speak to bad accuracy because I have not checked what refund would be using another program w/ same year's info. Too lazy. Others have had accuracy issues though, I've just learned from this site.
I filed one federal and two state returns. Taxact charge me $14.99 for the extra state return. But then it said it could not file one state return. Now, two months later and they can't verify who I am. They sure can figure you out to take your money. But when it comes to service? They say, "Who? We don't know you!" And how do I know if they are accurate? What a stupid question. The code is so complicated, who the heck knows? Give the supporting paper work and maybe I can figure it out....NOT
This will be the last year which I will purchase Taxact. It sounds as though anyone can use the program to complete their taxes, but the program is very complex. As you follow the guide, it prompts you to complete information such as Roth IRAs and such and acct numbers for which I don't have any. Comparing my previous 2 years shows a big discrepancy which I am now worried about and will have to check with the IRS for that concerning IRAs. I used to get refunds when I had reps at HR Block do my taxes, and with Taxact. I have been paying taxes each year. Unless you are very fluent in the tax system or have had training or have someone very fluent in the tax system, be aware that this program is not for the faint.
I decided to try TaxAct to file my 2013 return. I concede I didn't start the process until April 14. I found the process of using TaxAct circuitous and repetitive. Several times during the process, data had to be re-entered apparently because it was not saved. When I was finally finished (after six hours), I submitted the information for efiling. The program allowed me to establish my personal PIN for TaxAct, the program and noted I would receive an email confirming my completion. No confirmation came. Also, when I tried to check the status of filing at "efstatus.taxact.com" I found TaxAct had no record of my having filed. The online help was no help at all. References were circular. I tried calling the help number: busy signal. I won't be using TaxAct again. I will discourage others from using it.
I've been using Taxact for about 5+ years (Loyal Customer)... Never had a problem until October 2013, when I need to get a copy of my tax return... I WAS CHARGED!!! Never before had I been charged for printing out a copy of the same years return, now I use them again for this tax season and I thought I would mail my return which had always been free to do until now. I hope you're reading this Taxact because I will never use this greedy company again!!
You have to pay your full filing fee +, to speak with someone, even if their system is not working. I had my entire return completed except for one field that was blocked by their system. It was their error and they were requiring me to pay for technical support.
I only wanted the basic tax return. I was offered the deluxe tax return which I refused every time (there is a cost with the deluxe). After I entered all of my personal info, their website would not allow me to open the next box to do my tax return. I could not find a phone # for them. Sent an email and the automatic reply said they would be in touch in a day or two! Now I think they are just a scam to steal identities! I think I'm going to talk to the Attorney General's office and our action television news reporters! This just isn't right! I will be doing my tax return manually and keeping close tabs on my credit report! CONSUMER BEWARE!
Tax Act screwed me over with my state return. I had to file an amended return for the state return because stupid ** Tax Act made an error. YES they made the error on my earned income credit. I called customer service numerous amount of times so they can fix this and and they gave me the run around. I had to take care of this problem MYSELF. PLEASE DON'T USE TAX ACT, THEY ARE HORRIBLE. TELL YOUR FRIENDS, FAMILY AND ANYONE YOU KNOW NOT TO USE TAX ACT. THEY MAKE COSTLY ERRORS AND THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE IS COMPLETELY HORRIBLE.
Their website is so slow and has awful visual moving thing each time you click Continue which is distracting and adds to the feeling that it is so slow. They don't provide email to customer service. If you call them, their reps are apathetic and hang up or don't speak English as 1st language. When you ask for supervisor, it takes forever and their phones are staticky and they are also apathetic and incompetent. When reviewing my form online, it showed no entries for a particular field but when I submitted it, it showed a $2000 entry. I think they do this on purpose to try and get you to pay $13 to amend the return.
I have been using TaxACT for the last 4 years. Everything was fine until this year. My form was rejected because the companies' EIN did not match. The company was carried over from previous years TaxACT entries and EINS accepted. This year, although the EIN is correct, the form was not accepted, although the form was accepted by the state of California. I even checked with the company to make sure the EIN was correct. TaxACT has indicated they are not responsible for this cliche, even though previous years submissions were accepted.
I spent the worst afternoon of my life navigating through the TaxAct Deluxe edition software for my federal and state returns. First it didn't recognize my password; so I had to create a new password - the exact same one - which it finally accepted. Then I had to deal with multiple bugs, wrong turns and dead alleys, all the while the system kept timing out. THIS HAPPENED AT LEAST 10 TIMES! After struggling for over 4 hours (it normally takes me less than 1), I finally finished, and received an e-mail from them saying I had successfully filed. However the next AM, I got another one saying that my federal return had NOT been filed successfully. I called their customer support, and after a 15 min. wait, I got a very snooty young girl who said the e-mail was generated by their computers - and they had no control over it (????). I went on the IRS web-site, which indicated my return HAD been received. ANOTHER WASTED HOUR! I will NEVER use Tax Act again!!!
Cannot access past years return w/o paying for service!!!! Don't use Taxactonline!
I am having problems with professional 1040 software. First thing, the customer service wants money for support, even though software is not working properly. I was losing customer information after few days. Interacted for 7 days by email and phone support with Taxact. Support and emails did not solve my problem. I have seen a new issue that TAXACT, that it is not adding state tax information for itemization correctly. Customer service declined to let me talk to support service, whose advice rarely works. It is impossible to find executive information about taxact on the Internet. A few numbers I found, no one picks up the phone.
I have used Taxact for the past four years. I have been pleased and have also been able to input information directly from my 1098 sent to me by my school. I just wanted to correct the commenter who stated that you are unable to input information needed for the education credits and deductions. This year, I received notification from Taxact that my return was accepted by the IRS on Jan 28. However, at this point, I am still satisfied with Taxact but this IRS problem is infuriating! Has anyone else that received an incorrect DDD and received their refund?
I supposed to get about $2,000 back from the federal gov. and I got back only about $1,100. The support they offer is crap. I shouldn't have to pay again to speak to someone for their mistake. I will go to Turbo Tax next year.
I tested filing my taxes with Taxact and Turbotax. My refund with Turbotax is 3 times more than Taxact. Taxact does not allow you to enter information from the 1098T for college students. Will never use it.
I have been using TaxAct since 2007. I have no experience with the online version. I do not recommend the online version of any tax preparation software company. I have used their personal and professional programs offered by TaxAct. I have also used TurboTax products. TurboTax products are not really designed for tax professionals and Intuit's professional products are more than I care to spend. TaxAct has both an interview process and a form entry method of entering your information. I prefer the form entry, since I know my way around a tax return. If you don't know your way around a tax return, you really should find someone to do your taxes for you that is. Unless you know what you're doing it is easy to miss something. In some respects, TaxAct could probably be more user friendly. I've only had limited exposure to their customer service, which I would rate average. That being said, I still highly recommend their downloadable/sold in store products, but only for those who actually know what they're doing. Quite frankly, I'm at a loss to explain the popularity of TurboTax. If you're going to spend that kind of money, find a local tax preparer or buy TaxCut by H&R Block. Block software products come with Block Audit Defense. TurboTax sells a similar product for $40-50, but from what I've heard, it's worthless. Block's Audit Defense is included at no additional charge. Whether or not it's worth having, I don't know. By the way, I don't recommend H&R Block in-office tax preparation. I used to work for Block. Some of the preparers are good, others are not; and their prices have gotten outrageous. For the best deal in tax preparation, find someone who's local and reputable (like me).
Just a very bad product. Nothing here but a way to give up personal information, no tax help at all. Is there any internet site left that doesn't cheat/exploit/lie about what they do to make money from acquiring your personal information??? If one of these sites knocked on my door and offered me a bag of cash, I would slam the door in their face. What a bunch of mercenary thieves...
I filed my 2013 taxes last week and just got an email that my taxes were rejected for a mistake I made (Obviously my fault). So after going back into Taxact and fixing the mistake I'm told that I will be charged again to file my taxes. Not happy about that but whatever it was my mistake, I'll have to pay again fine. When I get to the end of submission I notice that my fee is now $27.98 for submitting my taxes that were rejected. The first time I submitted them it cost me $17.99. Now I'm getting charged an extra $10. I'm not happy at all. I'll just go somewhere else. No way I'm paying them $30 more. No chat support but I could submit an email and wait for a generic response I'm sure. Where should I file now?
I have used TaxAct for a few years. It seems somehow I was told to print something with my consent, then all went south. I will not deal with companies who do not have a decent support system. TaxAct was good while it lasted, but no more for me, my family and any others I can talk with.
I just want to say that I am sorry to hear all the problems you guys experienced. I took note and I have taken screen shots of my direct deposit and date of file and every other screen while using tax act. I will also start looking for legal counsel just in case. I advise you all to do so going forward with anything online. Screen shots don't lie!
I filed Tax act tax return in 2013 and could complete through the process. After filing my complete return I went to the taxact option to print the return. In doing so the return did pop up on my screen but the return could not be printed or downloaded. It seems to me that taxact has intentionally set the settings such that the returns could not be printed so that they can charge the customers a $10.95 fees to download the archived returns during the next tax season. I see that taxact has a lower fees for filing the tax returns than a lot of other tax preparation sites but I can see that they are using this strategy to scam more overall money out of their customers and I feel that this is a very poor business practice. I am certain that I will not use taxact service in 2014 even though I may be paying a slightly higher fees on other websites. Upon contacting the customer service for taxact, they continue to point out that I could have contacted their tech service to resolve the issue. However, it is to be noted that taxact tech service is open only on weekdays at normal working hours and for any working person it would be extremely difficult to take time out during normal work hours and spend 45 minutes with a representative on the phone for a service that they have already paid for. Overall, I rate my experience with taxact as very poor and recommend against using this service even though it may seem cheaper at the beginning.
I will agree their web site is harder to work with. My complaint is why in the heck do you have to pay to access your prior tax returns. Turbo Tax doesn't charge for that. Then when you go to their website, the only page you get right now is for you to pay for access to prior returns. Hello, TaxAct, can you at least update your web page that's screwed up. I don't want to access my prior returns, all I want to do is file my taxes online and wait until I can send them like Turbo Tax offers right now. I used them the last 3 years - won't this year at all. Me or my son or my daughter, 3 less returns.
Previous to TaxACT.com, I had used TurboTax for four years with absolutely no issues. So why just last year did I switch to TaxACT.com? Because I was going through severe financial issues and could not even afford the very affordable TurboTax. Man, was THAT a mistake! To start off with, TaxACT.com has absolutely the worst website design I have EVER seen, and that is not an exaggeration. Their methods for navigating to different pages is positively confusing where you will be faced with multiple Sign In buttons, and buttons that only work part of the time. If you want to access prior returns, you can click on the return, only to find yourself on a page that wants to sell you a product you do not want...with no link to your actual return anywhere on the page. Sometimes buttons just don't work. Sometimes clicking a button to get somewhere you need to be will take you back to the home page where it asks you to sign in...Again...After you have already signed in! So, am I still signed in, or have I been rudely logged off?! I'm building up to the really scary part, but I cannot let their other site problems go without comment. I just received an email from TaxACT.com telling me I needed to print or save to PDF, my 2012 return, before Oct. 31, 2013, or it would no longer be available. They told me this only 7 days before the deadline! So I immediately went to their website to do just that, only to find myself, three days later, without a copy of my return, and after emails back and forth with their customer un-support people. Simply put, their procedures for saving a PDF copy of my return do not work in either Firefox or IE. They claim you can right-click your return on the page they tell you to go to and save out as PDF, but such option does not exist. I have been going back and forth with these morons for three days now and all I get are canned responses to my questions. I even sent them a JPG showing a sequence of the different webpages I navigated through, and the problems I had at each stage, and I might as well have sent it to Pluto...They did not respond to the questions it posed, but instead repeated a comment they had made earlier in the email thread. Now the scary part: The manner in which you navigate to each of your tax return forms is utterly incomprehensible sometimes. I completed my 2012 tax return, knowing perfectly well it never let me list my business expenses. After about an hour and a half, I finally found the required forms. Contrast this with TurboTax where you are very carefully led through each form in turn, and depending on your circumstances, seems to always know what pages you need to fill out. TaxACT does none of this. The frightening thing is, was my tax return completed correctly. The scary thing is that the amount it said I owed was WAY above what was normal for my prior years. JUST GREAT! Now my question is, will this set off a red light with the IRS, leading to an audit for my prior years that I KNOW were filed correctly?!!!!!! In the least, I will now need to redo my 2012 return with TurboTax to make sure TaxACT did not screw up. I suspect it will find that I never had to pay the amount TaxACT said I did, and I will need to amend my 2012 return. Again, nothing like raising red flags with the IRS to make a nightmare 100 times worse! If I DO find errors, I am going to alert the BBB and the IRS to have these people investigated. Probably won't go anywhere, but neither can I just sit back and do nothing. TaxACT.com is an amateur effort, with a website designed by a beginner, or a moron, or maybe both. What this means is that you are placing your financial security in the hands of an inept team of more morons where not only may this debacle create issues between me and the IRS, but can I even trust that my private information is not being used illegally, or that the site is truly secure enough from the majority of hacker attacks? Stick with TurboTax. If you have never used TurboTax for an online solution to your tax return filing, go with them, NOT TaxAct.com. TaxACT is just that...An act by pretenders thinking they know what they are doing but clearly don't. Would you go to a doctor who only pretends to be one by reading a book on surgery? Or would you go with a doctor you know did his full terms in college, did his residency, and has been in practice for 20 years? AVOID TaxACT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I filed my 2012 returns on line with this company, and had put that I wanted a debit card with the funds. IRS confirmed that they mailed the refund to THEIR bank nearly 10 days ago, and still have no refund. This is after waiting for 5 months for IRS to decide to finally approve my refund.....
When I attempted to pay my 2012 taxes electronically, there was either no warning or no warning conspicuous enough telling me to check my email after filing. It was not until two weeks after the due date that my wife noticed the payment money had not been taken from our account. I then carefully looked through my email (lots of junk email) and discovered that the attempt to pay online had failed due to my the using date of filing (April 9) instead of posting it to the next day (April 10)??? I suppose I should have looked in my email within a few hours after filing but didn't have any reason to suspect something had gone wrong even though I had a similar problem in 2011 but resolved it without being penalized. TaxACT should post a big warning for those filing electronically: CHECK YOUR EMAIL AFTER FILING TO BE SURE IT WORKED!!! The penalties for late filing came to just over $200. Thanks, TaxACT.
I did my taxes with Tax Act from 2009 to 2011 - No complaints until 2011. I converted some retirement money into a Roth IRA. I was told by numerous sources that I would have to pay tax which I was okay with doing after to put in the conversion 4 times and no taxes were taken out. I thought they knew something I didn't. Now 2013, the IRS looked at it and I now owe $5200. Thanks Tax Act. They also allowed me to take student loan interest deduction and a lifetime learning credit which the IRS says I'm only allowed one or the other. Thanks again, Tax Act. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!
I completed and filed 3 returns with TaxACT this year. First year using it and I decided to use based on simple returns for wife and stepdaughter. Mine was more complicated, but TaxACT seemed to work. When I filed for my stepdaughter electronically, the return from IRS said someone already filed with that SS number. When I filed for my wife, it too was rejected due to her daughter filing "not a dependent on anyone else's return". This was not accurate as I filed her daughter's return. I believe TaxACT filed an erroneous return for my stepdaughter, forcing us to print and file by mail her's and my wife's. The good side of me thinks this was a system error. The conspiracy theorist thinks TaxACT filed a fraudulent return (knowingly wrong since I did not use the pay services). I'd like to believe they were honest and made an honest mistake but not sure. Based on the comments I see here, I’m not sure if this is an honest company.
This program was anything but user friendly. I knew the federal filing was free, and I was willing to pay for state filing. I was filing EXTENSIONS! The process was as detailed as filing my taxes; there was no clear indication when the e-file had occurred. They say they'll file the state for $12.95. I filled everything in. I wanted to print it as well (of course!). At the end, I learned there are only four states that accept e-filing. This was a waste of money, but much more importantly, it was a waste of valuable time.
One form about educational credits got goofed and the checks before filing failed. I was unable to get to where the problem is, so was unable to get to e-file. Everything in the wizard looks fine so I cannot find the problem to fix it. I had to resort to printing the forms but from the looks of them, I'm afraid the IRS is going to kick my return out, but now it's the 11th hour so there is no time to redo this whole thing by hand. This was a freaking nightmare with hours spent over weeks to get this return entered and ready and then at the last minute this happens - it's terrible. No customer support or assistance is available! I recommend avoiding these people.
VA has a consumer's use tax. TaxACT calculated it, but said it was not required to be paid because we were below the filing threshold. That was in error. VA requires filing a (non-income tax) Form CU-7 in those circumstances. I went through the complete process - reviews and alerts. When I went to e-file the VA return, it let me do so and charged me $7.95, but did not allow me to pay the amount owed and had no separate Form CU-7 to file. TaxACT refuses to refund the fee. I paid $21.95 for the Deluxe version which included Federal and State returns and one e-filing. It turns out to be e-filing only for federal, not state, even though I bought the deluxe package. It's very misleading. I don't trust them.
Briefly speaking, they screwed my federal and local returns and I regret I paid them $8.95 so they will keep my (wrong) federal return data for 3 years and $15 for a state e-file. I did not file the 2011 return. I don't know where they got the numbers for 2011 and added that to my 2012 return. Tax preparation business is based on trust so I did not verify my return with the second place (what other people do). For me, now it's a very good lesson not to do business with this place anymore. I will not recommend TaxAct to other people.
This program was my personal favorite until 2012. I'm not sure what happened but please do not use it. The software was not accurate for allowing dependent not living with taxpayer. Per IRS, grandchild does not have to live with tp all year to be dependent. Tax Act did not allow this dependent deduction. Also after going back in, my info changed. To be fair, I did not contact them to fix it. I went with another service. The program is not stable for 2012. Prior years were great.
This was my first time with this company and my last because once everything was submitted and confirmed for federal and state return, I checked my e-file status and they said my AGI number was missing. They said fix that and it will go through to IRS. No problem, I did that and my return still was rejected afterwards. I called customer service; they said I would have to pay to have my account reviewed for 20 dollars. And they claimed they couldn’t access my information until I paid. Like, really, you gotta be kidding me! So that was it. I had enough. I filed with Turbo Tax online and they processed my info and sent it to the IRS within one day. It came back cleared and I received my refund in 8 days. I will never recommend this tax company to anyone ever!
Never again, TaxACT. It was a waste of 17 dollars and hours of my time and the IRS wouldn't accept my return because the prior year PIN or AGI didn't match their records. No matter what I did to correct it, it was still rejected over and over and over. What a waste of time and money. I will never use TaxACT again. I will advise my friends to do the same and I suggest you do too.
In the past, I have always recommended this website to everyone who only had to file a Federal Return. TaxACT sent me a reminder to file with them, which I have for a few years. I am only required to file a Federal Income Tax Return since PA does no tax retirement income. I followed what I thought was free filing on the e-mail message and when I got to the part to transmit the electronic filing (E-file), there was a notice for a credit card to pay fees. It took a while until I realized my mistake due to the very misleading email that prompted me to file using the link in the message, but it took me to the Ultimate package. I am trying to delete all the information but I can't even access my own records. It is very frustrating.
I filled out the simple 1040EZ information and they tried to charge me? I thought it was free for all federal e.fillable forms? No mistake it costs money!
Another hotel overcharge story, same scam: Endeavor identifies innkeeper charges immediately. They assign the (hold) amount $120 regardless of the merchants input at the terminal. Then, your balance is deducted for a determined length of time. I eventually contacted a live person (after countless attempts had failed) and I heard laughter and jeers in the background, not in English. We have been ripped-off. Also, when the card expires, it takes weeks to get a replacement. They said it was lost. Ha! No wonder TaxACT dropped these snakes.
My state tax due was not paid on time. Taxactonline.com authorized payment for the 2011 tax year, due April 15th, 2012, filed in March, for November 21st, 2012. Let's think about that. Due in April (which the entire country knows), filed in March (March is before April), deducted in November (after April). So, I was charged a past due balance plus interest. Also, what kind of ethical company makes you pay to speak to a customer service rep on the phone? Looks like I'll be taking my business elsewhere next year.
Federal or state has not received my electronic tax forms yet filed on 4/6/2012. Please help. Where's my refund?
I filed my tax return on Taxact.com and as an option, you can chose to place your refund on a Taxact Endeavor Debit card by Bancorp Bank. My refund was deposited on Feb. 7, 2012 and I have yet to access one penny of my funds. They refuse to release my money, even though I faxed them copies of my social security card, driver's license and proof of address. Bancorp told me they suspected fraudulent activity on my card, which is a joke because I can't even use the card. The only fraudulent activity is Bancorp holding my funds. I contacted the IRS and they traced the refund, but refused to help me further, even though they endorse Taxact.com on the IRS website. I have contacted the attorney general, various newspapers, the Federal Trade Commission, FBI, local congressman and lastly, my state senator. I encourage everyone to do the same. At this point, I am working with my state senator, who responded quickly to my letter of concern and has a case worker reviewing the situation. I am beginning to see a glimmer of hope. Please don't take this sitting down! Be proactive! Taxact and Bancorp Bank need to be punished for their unjust actions by every legal means possible!
I have tried several times to get access to my funds after receiving my Endeavor card. Customer service here is run by very young, inexperienced, rude, and obnoxious people. Trying to resolve an issue with getting access to my funds, so far I was told to call back after they were closed, was put back into their queue over and over, and then told my PIN number would be mailed to me. So far nothing has happened and I still don't have access to my funds.
On February 27, 2012, I found out that the IRS or TaxACT had deposited my $4,790 refund check from the IRS onto an Endeavor card that was mailed on February 9, 2012. I never received that card. Customer service issued me another one at that time and I never received that one either. I have had yet another one issued and after 10 days: no card. Funny, I receive all my other mail. I have never been informed that there has been any charge for the non-existent customer service, but my refund amount is dwindling away as we read this and I have never had access to even one penny of the money. I am PO’d to say the lease, but this is affecting my credit and many other aspects of my life as I am unemployed and needed this money to pay outstanding bills that I cannot meet without my tax refund. I want to file suit on these people, but I don’t know how or where to start. It’s April 21, 2012 and there is still no card in the mail. They are not mailing it for some reason. I want my money. I need my money. What can I do next?
I used TaxACT to e-file my 2011 taxes. Although I have a checking account, I do not have paper checks. The bank routing number was not readily available upon filing so I decided to get my refund on the Endeavor Card this year. The IRS deposited my refund to that account on February 8, 2012. On February 27, there was still no card in the mail. I went through the procedure with the Bancorp on the telephone, which took forever to reach someone and they were anxious to say, "It sounds like your card was lost in the mail, we will issue you another one." I asked if they had all the information necessary. I was assured that they did and I would receive a new card in the mail in 7 to 10 days. On day 10, there was still no card and it was at this time I was told that there was a hold on my card--pending proof of address. So I faxed them a copy of my lease, drivers license and Social Security card. Four days later, I called to make sure everything was in line and was told that a lease was not a sufficient proof of address. Of course, no one had ever called me to inform me of these hold ups so I guess I would have just dangled in limbo forever had I not contacted them. I was given the number for the risk department to file a complaint where you are asked to leave a message. I left 27 of them over the following days but I never heard from them. I was finally given the word that it was a go and all the information was good. They would issue me a new card and I would receive it in 7 to 10 days. By now, it is March 27. The card was mailed on March 30 and on April 10, 2012, I still had no card. There is no one to talk to except these people who read scripted answers and their only answer is to issue me another card. It's hard to believe that my Endeavor Card has been lost in the mail twice! I wish that this would happen with my electric bill only once! I don't have any trouble receiving any other of my mail. So the IRS gave Bancorp my money on February 8, and as of April 14, 2012, I still have not received my card. There seems to be no relief in sight. I welcome a call from an attorney or anyone else that can offer any advice as to how to proceed.
I filed my electronic 2011 tax return using TaxACT software. I was given the option of receiving my refund via direct deposit or by check from the IRS or by prepaid Endeavor card. I chose the Endeavor card option. I was told that I would receive the Endeavor card within 7-10 business days. It has been nearly 18 business days and I have not received the Endeavor card. I called 2nd Story Software, who are the makers of TaxACT software and they referred me to the Endeavor people who I found are located in Asia. When I call Endeavor (China), I am told that they will send out another card; which means another 7-10 business days. However, if I want them to expedite it, it will cost me an additional $60. This is a rip off and a scam. Failure to provide services promised I would like this matter investigated and taken care of as soon as possible.
I'm trying to find a phone number to talk with a TaxACT representative. I need to review older tax reports, and I can't recall my username. I've tried e-mail, but that will take 24-48 hours to get a reply. I need a phone number, and so far, it hasn't be located. If other respondents can send the phone number, it would be greatly appreciated.
I have been doing my taxes with Taxactonline for the past 3 years. I always pay to keep my prior data available. This year, they couldn't find me in the system. How can they delete a customer's information and tell me I probably filed with another company? I have credit card charges to prove them wrong. The company doesn't seem to care, bad customer service. It is not worth to start a return with Taxactonline.
I filed my taxes on TaxAct every year like normal, but this time, opted to get the reloadable card instead of a paper check. Other than the balance inquiry fees and initial $16.99 just to possess the card, not to mention the $2.50 a month upkeep charge on the account, it's not a bad deal at all. For someone who doesn't have a bank account, it allows you to load the card by payroll checks or at a local retail store which the card doesn't charge to load, but the affiliate does, as long as you use it in a POS setting. It is free for purchases, otherwise you will be charged. So if you would like to pull money out, just consider doing a large amount and then leaving the rest for minor items. My complaint is I didn't think it would be so difficult to find retail locations where I can add some money onto it. I believe MoneyGram is the only location? Please someone, if they find additional locations, correct me if my wrong. All and all the, card gets an 8-10 score for me, considering it was in the mail and ready to spend just 13 calendar days after accepted when I was given a quote of 15-30 days. So I would recommend the product, it's easy to navigate through, affordable when you only file for federal and the card gives me the option to file the same way next year. So final question, after looking through the internet, is MoneyGram the only retail location to reload the card at? Thank you very much.
The Endeavor card didn't come until two weeks after my refund was deposited. They put strange holds on your account for lengthy amount of times. Customer service is poor.
My refund was deposited to endeavor card 2-29-2012. I have not received my card yet! I called last week on Monday and was told I would be issued another one, but I have not received it yet. Where is my card? I want my money!
First of all, I would think it's fair to say that there seems to be a mixture of complaints and non-complaints. My problem is simply waiting on my payroll to hit the bank. I received a pay stub in the mail from my employer saying that the pay was being directly deposited. That was on Wed the 14th. On Fri the 16th, I checked both by internet and later, around 4 p.m. by phone. I was told that it would take 10 days. I asked why? Then I was quickly put on hold, then I was told it would take 48 hours. Of course, my pay stub was dated 3/16/2012 which means I should have had funds available then. Today Is 3/18/2012, where the heck is my money? Maybe the BBB need to get in the mix of the goings on of Taxactonline. They may be another "Mo Money" company. My dog has run out of food and I need to pay bills which are timed to my pay schedule. I need gas to get back and forth to work, not to mention, bill collectors are not sympathetic, and they do not want to hear excuses. If any of the people of this company, if they were in our places, could they wait and put up with the same complaints as some have? What would be the outcome? At first I was dissatisfied, now I'm downright angry and will probably go back with Jackson Hewitt Ipower Card. Enough said.
I withdrew some money from an ATM and the machine froze up and didn't give me any money. The money was still taken out my account so I called the company and they told me to call the TaxAct Endeavor Card to get a form to fill out so they can put my money back into the account. Well I called them and they told me they were not accepting any calls. I called them for two weeks, sent emails, left messages and still no one has returned my calls. So today I finally called and the rep gave me the runaround and told me to call another number. I called that number and it sent the call back to him. I am so mad right now and I will never file with TaxAct again! I don't know what to do about this and I need my $200!
Via phone, I cannot reach a customer service representative. I have called dozens of times during all times of day and I cannot reach a customer service representative. It is nearly impossible to check the card balance without internet access and I cannot address complaints with anyone. I am starting to wonder if any customer help exists for the Endeavor Card sent to me by TaxAct for my tax return.
It is difficult to use, and would not print properly, after spending hours for a 45 minute job. I will find out whether I'll have the same problem many are complaining about. I will have to see about the refund routing, and being put on a card, when that was not the choice. I can't recommend using this provider, after this year's problems.
Federal and State Tax Returns: I got all the way through the forms and was unable to print my forms and thus did not file them. I was charged $17.95 anyway.
I filed my taxes through TaxAct and chose to have my refund put on the Endeavor card. Almost a month after my taxes were accepted, I still do not have my card. I contacted TaxAct and they said they have nothing to do with the card, so I have tried to call the helpline for Bankcorp or whatever and can never get through. I have emailed several times, got a response telling me to provide my phone number, which I did and still have heard nothing! The IRS website says my refund was deposited on the 15th of February.
I was supposed to receive my refund via direct deposit on February 15, 2012. After speaking with my bank and IRS several times, I found out additional numbers were added to the end of my account number. I asked the IRS if I could verify the last 4 digits of my account number, and that's when I realized what happened. The banking information was typed directly from my direct deposit form, and was triple checked. I'm absolutely certain the account number was typed correctly. There must be a glitch in the Tax Act website. That's the only way to explain it. I'm still waiting to receive my refund. Good luck everyone!
They stole money off my card twice: Taxact has been taking money off my card. I called to speak with them and was put on hold for 30 minutes, then it rang. Someone picked up but never responded. This company should be shut down and have to reimburse everyone who they have stolen from and then some.
Deceptive Incentive to Pay Upgrade Fee: My son used the service to file his EZ-Return. He only made about $5000. He made a mistake and had to amend the return. When he went to do that, the website indicated he had to pay $9.95 to amend the return. I did so and then found out that he couldn't electronically file an amended return. We had to file an amended return by printing out the return and mailing it. We never would have paid the fee if we had been told this. TaxACT refused to refund the fee despite the fact that they could not file the amended return. We feel deceived. We will never use them again and will tell every person we know not to use this company.
I never received my card. I filed for my refund on 1/19/12; my refund was deposited on 2/8/12 and I still don't have my card. I can't get through when I call the 800 number. This is bull**** !
I filed my taxes on Feb 5th 2011 and was quickly accepted by the IRS for my refund. The refund date was posted on the TaxAct Website was Feb 15th (the IRS is supposed to deposit my refund) for my bank to receive it. In addition, they said to give the bank 48-72 hours for refund to be available. Well it’s now Feb 20th, no refund! I went to IRS website 48 hours after I did the e-filing and it said my deposit was to be done on Feb 13th, and it now, (Today) says they will deposit the money on Feb 23rd. Well what’s up with this? The TaxAct website still says Feb 15th! So I guess I will wait till the 23rd and see what happens then. Has anyone else had this problem with TaxAct this year?
I filed my taxes on 2/5/12 and was told I would get it by 2/15/12. Well it's 2/20/12 and still nothing. I have no car, no money, no food. I just started a job with no transportation, so now I will lose this job. I was told how great this company was. I now see it's not go. I will go back to TurboTax, where I get my money a lot faster. I will never use TaxACT again and will tell everybody I know what happened and not to use it either. I am very disappointed.
I had received only $668 of my funds. However, my refund was $2,964 dollars. I am trying to see when the rest of my funds will be received.
I have done my taxes with Taxact for the last 3 years; I didn't have a bank account this year so I opted for the endeavor card which was to be here in 7 to 10 days. The IRS deposited the money on 2/15. Haven't received the card can't get Bancorp on the phone, Taxact told me sorry not their problem because they got their money and I should try emailing Bancorp THEY still haven't been emailed back. Taxact should step up because and deal with Bancorp because it makes them look bad won’t use Taxact next year. Can anyone help me?
I asked for my taxes to be put on my own card, but they pushed for the Endeavor Card. Now I cannot get to my money due to it denying me all the time. I am pissed off! I have bills to pay, and it will not let me have them! Don't use this service.
My boyfriend and I completed our taxes and sent them in January 23, 2012 and we called to see when our cards were suppose to be here and they said, by February 7, 2012 and we haven't received them yet. Today is February 14, 2012 and we still do not have them. We have been trying to contact the 1-866 number we got for the card and we have not been able to get through since we called to see when the cards were suppose to get here. We call every day!
I filled my daughter’s taxes for her and much to our dismay; she has not received the card. The IRS deposited her refund on the card on February 7, 2012. I have unsuccessfully tried to reach The Bancorp who is the "bank" that issues the Endeavor card, by way of e-mail to their card operations e-mail the recording provides. Also, I went online and found a listing to email their product solutions email address, multiple daily phone calls trying to get anyone to answer a call, then in my final straw today, I called their headquarters was transferred three times, put on hold for ten minutes to have a recording tell me to leave a message and they would get back to me in one business day. Oh and that is the exact message you get when they give you the message to email card operations. This is now day number seven of this nightmare of no responses. I am at the point where this seems nothing short of criminal.
I filed federal return with TaxAct and agreed to have refund placed on pre-paid Endeavor Card. I received card promptly, but repeated calls (20 or more) to the customer service number included with the card have received only a recorded response that due to heavy call volume, they can't take the call and to try again later. I suspect this is an intentional ploy to allow Bancorp Bank interest free use of these funds.
I chose to use the Endeavor credit card for my tax refund and I feel this was a major mistake because I should have already received it by the 3rd of February. I have called every day; the first which I held for one hour then held for 45 minutes, the second time now, you get a recording to call back later. I feel that the IRS should not have included this choice to receive tax refund on the IRS website. Now, it won't let me go in and put information so you can check the status of the money. I just want my money. I will never again use this credit card company.
I filed my taxes on 1/20/12. I was accepted the next day 1/21. TaxAct "claims" the Endeavor Card comes within 7-10 business days. It is now 2/4, exactly 14 days and 10 business days later. Still no card. I called the Bancorp customer service number last Friday. The woman on the phone told me they processed my card 1/23 and I would get it in 7-10 business days (wow, great help) so I would've received it anywhere from 1/31 to 2/3. Today is 2/4 and my DD date is 2/6. I still don't have my Endeavor Card. The customer service line has been absolutely unreachable the last 3 days. I’ve tried calling. Every time I call I’m on hold anywhere from 45 minutes to 2 hours. Before I can't wait anymore and hang up, I’ve actually waited a full hour on hold just to hear, "Due to unforeseen circumstances, we cannot answer your call at this time please try again later." I don't know what to do anymore. TaxAct customer service doesn't know Jack. Bancorp is unreachable, and I’m sure the IRS can't do anything. I've done a lot of research on The Bancorp Bank and their Endeavor Card and it’s not just this year but over the years tons of people have had this issue (and many other problems which are even worse but I won't go into). So to anyone that hasn't filed yet: never use the TaxAct Endeavor Card! If anyone is reading this and had the same problem but finally got there card, please tell me how long it took you to get your card. I really need my money and my DD date is the day after tomorrow but because I didn't get my card in the mail today I won't have my card when my DD goes through, which is even more frustrating because my card will be floating around in the mail somewhere with my money on it. If I don't get my card on Monday I want to know what other options I have if any.
I cannot print my return for my records. I've done all I know to do and tried the suggested solutions. But still I am not able to print it.
I filed my taxes online like I have been with this company for several years. This year never received my card, can't get in contact with customer service, when I did was hung up on. Told I could get my card expedited for 50 bucks agreed still no tracking number, no response, nothing I'm to through need to pay my bills and am totally backed up my money was deposited to this Bancorp Bank on the first and I still have nothing. I need my money now.
I filed my taxes with TaxAct which went fine. I agreed to have my refund direct deposited onto the Endeavor master card. When telling you about the endeavor card, it says it can be used to make online purchases. I purchased an item from someone with a PayPal account and cannot use this card. There is no way to transfer funds from this card to another account or card and when you call customer service, most of the time you can't get through. And when you do, you're charged $2.50 to not get your problem resolved.
I got the card but no money released. This is a very big rip off.
I have an Endeavor card that expires on 2/12. First, they shut it off a month early, and I had to complain. They said I would get a new expiration date. This never happened. Now, it is just days before I lose my card, and they are too busy to answer the phone. I called and they hung up with a callback later, yet they charge me a $2.50 service charge. They also can't be contacted by email. What a fraud! I am paying $2.50 to get hung up on. I need contact, and I need it now.
Simple: I paid for the one-time DAS fee to access my 2010 taxes last year, and today, I go to print out the filed taxes from last year and I have to pay another one-time fee in order to access the information. I"ll never use Taxact again.
I was unaware TaxAct online had an age limitation for the so-called "free" e-file. It is atrocious! I used TaxAct last year but turned 56 just 2 months ago. After spending over an hour getting my return ready, I find they were going to charge me $7.95 to e-file. I will not use their services again and I will warn all of my friends, relatives, and co-workers. I feel like a victim of fraud. Their false and fraudulent advertising is all over television, radio, the internet, and the IRS site. Every one of their ads says "free" federal e-file, "free" tax preparation, and "free for everyone".
I used tax act last year, very pleased; also used tax act this year, very pleased with the service. What I'm not pleased about is the Endeavor Card or the Bancorp people and as a reflection that leads right back to tax act because they are associated with Tax-Act. I have an illness and I have a limited time left on this wonderful earth, but I don't have any insurance to pay for my blood work, my medicine and a few more vital things that I need in life all because the associates Tax-Act uses will not give me my IRS refund. I was told to leave the hospital Jan. 28, 2012 because of my insurance problems. I used Tax-Act to file my taxes this year, and was accepted by the IRS, etc. I had my card expedited so I could buy me some insurance and get my medicine for my illness. It's only supposed to take two-three business days; it's been two weeks and no card. When I talk to Endeavor custom service they hang up on me and say it's Bancorp's fault. When I talk to Bancorp they say it's Tax-Act's fault. I don't care who's at fault, where's my money? I'm dying and I need my medicine and my blood work by Friday, which will be in two days. I need help. If anyone can help me get my money from these guys, God will bless you and I will pray for you. I can be reached at **. I need help!
Get this pop up advertisement off my email page! It has no "X" out or close button and is blocking my page! I am sick and tired of having to get offline to get rid of it. Then after I check and deleted my emails, it pops right back up! I am getting pissed off!
I want to file a class action lawsuit against tax act. I filed Jan. 10. It was accepted on Jan. 13 and it was direct deposited on 24th. I called customer service and they acted stupid and I was charged $2.50. I had to call again to talk to someone with brains which told me it would be there in 1-3 business days and I was charged another $2.50. Meanwhile, I can't log in online. I had to call and ask why I was charged $2.50. They said a new card will be issued in February, which is the reason why I cannot log in into it. Does that make sense? It is the 27th and still no money. So I called back and another $2.50 was charged. Whoops! No, this time they decided to double the charge—it was at -$7.50 and it should be -$10.00 but it says -$12.00 off my Endeavor card so far. I think they hold your money longer so you call and they can charge and you make millions and laugh in your face. I understand that existence of a wrong, which forms the basis for a lawsuit, affecting a specific group of individuals or businesses is required in order to file a class action lawsuit. Locate an attorney who handles class action lawsuits. Attorneys may be located using the Martindale Hubbell website. This website allows you to search for attorneys either geographically or by the category of type of lawsuits handled by that attorney. Sign an agreement with an attorney to represent you in the class action. You may be required to pay a retainer fee, such as a deposit, against any attorney's fees and/or costs incurred by the attorney in handling your case. File the class action lawsuit. One of the most often used reasons for filing a class action is to recover damages incurred based on products liability theory or relative to defective products. Unless you are granted a deferral or waiver of filing fees, you will be required to pay a filing fee which varies among the courts. Serve a summons and complaint on the appropriate defendant(s). You may need to hire a professional process server to perform this task. Then send or publish the notice to all members of the specific class of members as per the order of the court. The court generally decides how proper notice should be given to the plaintiffs. Generally, notice is given either through publication of a notice in a major newspaper or magazine, or via service by mail or by personally serving notice. You will then need to provide the court and the opposing party/parties with a copy of the certificate of compliance with the court's order.
I filed with TaxAct for 2011 taxes. I chose to use the endeavor credit card card have not received it. I called and finally got through to the company and was told they received release for it on Jan. 17, but I will not receive my card until Jan. 31. That's not fair. Due to them holding my money, me and my children are now homeless. I was needing that money for a house. How can they keep my money and collect interest off me? They get paid enough from everyone. Why is our government allowing this to happen?
Fraud charges on my card, called, investigation was to be done. Was never called back. Called again, was told it had been too long. "Sorry nothing I can do."
Fraud charges on my card, reported it. Never notified back. Called again, was told it had never been filed and it was too late, sorry.
I tried to start my taxes on Tax Act website and ended up with the online edition. This edition is terrible. It is very difficult to use, shuts down frequently, difficult to navigate and does not allow me to save my returns. I have wasted dozens of hours due to this terrible software and it is impairing my ability to file my taxes. I was supposed to receive a free e-filing for both federal and state, but the state filing was not available for Oklahoma Non-Residents. The other main issue is that after I filed my taxes with the online version, there is no way for me to save a couple of my own tax files that I spent hours creating on my own computer. They also want to charge me an archive fee to save my tax records. I basically purchased a product for a one-time use and now, I don't even have anything to save for my taxes except for a printed copy. I asked them about converting from the online version to the normal downloadable version that I have used in the past and they said that is not an option. The way that this software was marketed seems very fraudulent.
TaxAct combined my income information from Federal in filling out my State. In the Federal they kept my wages earned from an employer separate from unemployment benefits. But as for the State part, they "imported" this sum as one lump sum for income and had NOWHERE to correct this. I didn't notice until after when I was given fees and letters from the IRS telling me that I hadn't reported the unemployment benefits onto the State return. So they added it on (thought it had already been added on), and this upped my taxes.
I used TaxACT just like the previous years ,but this time decided to get the Endeavor card. That was the biggest mistake. You can only use the card at one certain bank but they don't tell you this. You have to call them and see why your card don't work and to talk to someone, they charge you $3.50. I used my card for a room deposit just as a hold. They went ahead and put it through as a charge at $120.They were only supposed to use it as a hold, not run it.The fee was $100 not $120. The hotel says it has been released back to my card as it takes 14 to do this on their end so I need to call my bank. So I called and once again I get charged $2.50 to ask about my own money. They tell me that it's still there but it's on hold now till July 19 .I used this card at the hotel on June 5th just for one night and now it's gonna take a month and a half to get my money back? This card is the biggest rip off I've ever seen. It charges you for every transaction you make. The bank charges you and the business charges you. So you get double screwed .I plan on letting everybody I can know about this card and hopefully, enough people will hear about it and the company will get shut down.
Utter failure. Could never get my state taxes filed. Once I realized that and sent them in manually, I had already been charged the fee by TaxAct. I have been charged a penalty by the state for late filing. The Feds sent me a notice that my return was not signed and I can't find any way to contact them. Unreliable and a bad experience. Not recommended especially for something that can put your finances in jeopardy.Con sequences: $26.07 and $17.95.
The so-called premier Federal & State TaxAct software simply does not allow a person to e-file their returns, and does not provide the state part of the deal. I am unbelievably frustrated with the lack of support and have been unable to file. This product is **.
I filed my taxes online with TaxAct.com and elected to have my filing fees come out of my refund. Well, I got my refund the day I was supposed to but it was over $3000.00 short! I can't believe this. Republic Bank and Trust, the bank that was authorized to take my filing fees, took it upon themselves to take the majority of my refund and send it to a company in California for a student loan. However, this student loan wasn't in default and the IRS is not the one who did this. How can they get away with this? I've looked for tax lawyers and all I can find is one that helps when you owe taxes to IRS. I didn't get any offset letter from IRS and they gave Republic Bank the entire amount of refund. How do they then have the right to do this on their own cognizance and what is the recourse that I can take against Republic Bank and Trust?
I have been using Tax Act since 2003. I never had a problem and I still use them. Sorry for all the problems people have. I have never paid for my taxes and I do long form because of being a business owner. People need to pay attention you can get by Tax deluxe. If you hit no thanks. All of you people who are saying you cannot, are not doing it right because it works very good. I have told others about this site and are happy. I would never have my money go to any bank but chase and it has always been there when it is suppose to. When I have made errors it has come back and told me I entered something wrong. And I have paid the 12.95 for archived records and has received them right away. I can tell people who just want to complaint about services and it is so funny because this is a great service if you know how to use it correctly. Everyone is not capable of doing their own taxes and should maybe go to a tax preparer instead of blaming it on the company. Blame it on yourself for not being able to read the instructions correctly.
TaxActOnline has been bombarding me with emails claiming to have first filed my taxes and then telling me there's a problem with a company tax ID number so I need to contact them to straighten it out. Since I never heard of this company until a few days ago, and haven't even begun to do my taxes, I don't know what they're talking about. And there's no good way to contact them. I don't know who's doing what, but something is fishy.
Previous Years Tax Act would import you prior years' data to save time in completing all the forms. Now Tax Act wants to charge an extra fee to import that data and also to print any of your prior years returns. I have been filing with them for many years and this is the first time I have not been able to import and print old returns for free.
I was offered this Endeavor card for my tax return. Any way that I handle the card results in service charges that I cannot bypass. I was misinformed. I felt that I was signing up for a direct deposit card that was handled like a gift card. A $2500.00 tax return is being charged, $2.50 a month, $5.00 for any withdrawal, and an initial charge of $33.00 plus whatever it costs for their tax services. Charges are also incurred if you use the card for purchases. This is a major scam.
I have invested about 7 hours and $12.95 in attempting to retrieve a copy of my 2008 Income taxes which I filed electronically on Tax Act. I had problems from the get go. First, I had to request updated sign in information, that worked sometimes and other times would lock me out of my account. Then I emailed them for assistance, paid the $12.95 for a copy of a prior year return then attempted to retrieve it. I still do not have a copy of my 2008 tax forms (state or federal). I have used tax act for the past two years and am reminded once again why I keep saying I will never use them again and this year I did not. It took me two years to come to my senses. I will never recommend this site to anyone.
I got my tax refund put on an Endeavor Card. Everything was fine until I charged a hotel room to the card. They held $120 as a deposit. I had my vacation, the hotel cleared my account but Endeavor will not release the $120 deposit. When you try to email them, it comes up invalid. When you call them, they charge you $3.95 per call. I paid the $3.95 and talked to someone who said the hotel needed to call them. The hotel called Endeavor (and I was charged another $3.95) and Endeavor said they would hold that charge for one year. Each month of non-use, $2.95 gets deducted. By the time the year is up, I will have no funds left in the account. What a scam.
I have very simple returns and have used this software for about 5 years without incident. My 2009 return was botched. TaxAct did not calculate a Schedule M for me when I rightly deserved the credit, and their software was not smart enough to inform me that I was entitled to claim the new home buyers credit on my 2009 return if I purchased the home in early 2010. Now they want me to pay extra to file an amendment. This is the last time I use or let anyone I know use this software.
Like others on here, my refund was erroneously put on Taxact's own Endeavor Debit Card instead of the bank account I instructed them to deposit it into. They have limited amounts that you can take out and charge a fee to do so. When my wife tried to call the number on the back of the card, she was instructed that she would have to pay 3.95 to talk with anyone about this. This is a shameful, dishonest way business practice which should be illegal. A policy to make your customers get the service they have already paid for? Extra charges to get my own money of out of the debit account. I have already paid to prepare the taxes through this business. I shouldn't have to pay more to get my money, especially when my deposit instructions weren't followed.
On 4/14/2010, I was contacted by my Mother, Joan regarding her use of taxact.com for a tax filing. She calmed, she was contacted by a taxact representative and was informed her tax return would be done completely free of charge. I reviewed this after she had been duped into paying $17.95. I went to their website and it claimed a free tax filing. However, when you proceed there's no way to actually get a free tax return filing without a deluxe upgrade. Loss of $17.95.
The TaxAct software worked, however, it tricked me into upgrading to deluxe, which I had absolutely no intention to do. I tried to reverse instantly, tried to get my money back, and got terrible response. I recommend that you use another, more honest service that charges only for what you use. I also find it disgraceful how many times the service shut me out, forcing me to idle for 10-20 minutes.
I e-filed my 2009 federal tax return online through taxact.com. I opted to receive my return via their prepaid debit card, (Endeavor Card by Bancorp Bank HSA) My return has since been direct deposited onto my Endeavor Card, however, someone tried to receive an additional card without my consent, thus alerting their fraud department. This is not my complaint. In fact, I applaud them for this action, my problem is I have provided via fax (at my expense of $16.11 to be exact) All of the documents they requested 3 days ago. Without so much as a return call to resolve this problem. I am on a fixed income and am depending on my return desperately. I cannot even get a live customer service person, let alone a supervisor, after numerous voice mails, that is all they offer, I am outraged that my return is just sitting there, even if I have provided all of the documents they have so curtly requested. This outrageous act has affected not just myself, but all of my family, in which, I alone support. I am on a strict budget, as to the hard economic trouble that our country is in. I have had to go so far as to find food banks, have had my electricity disconnected, suffered financial embarrassment, mental anguish and so much more than I care to mention as to the blatant customer service I have received from the above mentioned business. I just want what is rightfully mine and should have had full access to days ago.
It is only fair that people also read success stories. I have been doing my taxes through TaxAct since 2005 and I have had plenty of help. The people have been patient and I'm a hyper person but they would listen and help me to resolve my tax issues or guide me where I would need to go. Never had to wait long to be helped-- what can I say. Sorry for those who were not as successful.
On February 24, I completed my online taxes and submitted them for refund. I was told that I would receive my refund on the Bancorp endeavor card within 10 business days. It has been almost a month of Mon-Fri waiting and still no refund. I have tried contacting 2nd story products to resolve this matter and all I get is the runaround and a phone number that is busy 24/7 or not answered because of heavy call volumes. The number given to me is for Bancorp. What are they doing with my money and why can't I get what belongs rightfully to me? As far as I am concerned, I hope that particular bank goes belly up because of their incompetence and non compliance with their agreement. A class action law suit should be brought against these companies for breaking contract. If I or one of my fellow Americans were to break contract, we would pay heavily but it seems that no one cares what companies like this do. I am very disappointed in this company and I would like to ask the question, "What if the people decided that enough is enough and they aren't going to pay taxes due to this happening?" My next complaint will be lodged with the Fed Trade Commission Consumer Affairs division and will be repeated until I have this matter resolved. There are a few damages such as putting me in a position of duress. I am stressed over past due bills and cannot afford to buy the necessities of daily life i.e., pet care and personal products. I have actually became an insomniac due to stress and cannot afford to go to the hospital or buuy medications to relieve these issues. I have also became very disappointed in our system both legal and of commerce. It is this type of betrayal of contract that causes really big problems not for just myself but the nation as a whole and it's time someone stood up and took action against it recurring in the future.
I had started filing my 2008 taxes with TaxActOnline. When I kept getting information I was not entitled to on earned income credit. I tried to correct the information, but could not so I cancelled the process. So I did a paper file but I am not sure my online filing was cancelled and the IRS may use both. A loss on my refund because a claim by the IRS that my 2007 tax return did not match.
I cannot get any kind of contact with Tax Act. I completed a tax return on 2/18/10 with no kind of message from Tax Act. I need my return done now.
I filed my federal and state taxes with TaxAct. I understood I could file my federal online for free and I would have to pay $14.95 to file my state taxes. I was charged $14.95 twice for filing my state taxes. I would like to know why I was charged twice.
I attempted to file my 2009 taxes online through Taxact.com. I paid them $14.95 for "deluxe" service and another $5.95 for storing the records. The 1040 goes fine. I answered all questions and provided PIN numbers but it won't print. If it won't print, they can't file it. I watched the video, read all the help sites and sent an email. Taxact.com responds by telling me to watch the video, check the pop-up blocker, check my Adobe, blah blah blah. I did all the things suggested. It still won't print, won't file. No help, no taxes filed. I just paid for absolutely nothing and now have to go out and find a tax preparer or just get the forms and file them myself like in the "olden days" file them.
I used TaxAct Online to prepare my 2009 income taxes as an individual. I e-filed both Federal and California State taxes, paying TaxAct Online $14.95 to e-file the state return. For both refunds, I instructed TaxAct Online to have my refunds deposited directly to my Wal-Mart Money Card and provided the same account information for both refunds. I received the federal tax return onto my debit card the same day I was told it had been processed by the IRS. I then submitted the state return with refund instructions the same. On 2/18/2010, I called the FTB to inquire about my refund. I was told it had been processed on 2/16/2010, but it did not make it my debit card. So, I e-mailed TaxAct Online and inquired about why my refund wasn't on my card yet. I received a reply from them that I had chosen the option of having my refund deposited onto one of their "Endeavor" debit cards, which would then be mailed to me. This is completely untrue. In the meantime, I received an e-mail from Chase Bank today informing me that a statement concerning my deposit is online at the Chase site, and to "click here" to be taken to my account. I have a very overdrawn account with Chase Bank and have not been using the account because I haven't been able to pay it back. When I attempted to access my Chase account, I was locked out of it. I then tried to call the 24-hour automated teller on the phone to obtain information about this so-called deposit, but was also locked out of that. These "Endeavor" debit cards that TaxAct Online is referring to are such that the information on them are shared between banks; thus, depriving one of privacy concerning his/her financial information. By this ** up on the part of TaxAct Online, it has not followed my instructions for submitting my state tax return, has instructed the FTB to deposit my refund in a way I did not instruct, and has allowed my refund to be seized by Chase Bank; thus, depriving me of the money I was expecting to pay my phone and electric bills (due Monday). Chase Bank has illegally taken money from me without due process of law. The impact of this is devastating. Likely, my phone and electricity will be shut off Monday. And as I work online as a medical transcriptionist, I will lose my job.
First, to those who say read the fine print, I always do! I used TaxAct last year with no problems. This year is a different story. I decided to use the Endeavor card option this year. You know, receive your refund within 7-10 days. It has been 3 weeks now and still no refund! My refund was direct deposited on the 12th, I received my card on the 18th (okay, holiday weekend. I can understand that). I activated my card and found out that it has a zero balance! I called customer service only to be charged $2.50 to speak with a live person! And by the way, that was charged to the card within seconds! Anyhow, they could not give me any answers and told me to call the fraud department. I called only to be told they have not received notice from the IRS. Okay. Calling the IRS and they told me of course that the funds were deposited on the 12th and gave me a routing and account number. I called the fraud department back and gave them the information the IRS gave me. The representative (Misty) told me that it was in fact their routing and account number, but yet they still have not received "notice" from the IRS! They repeated this line over and over no matter who you talk to. It's very frustrating not being able to get answers from this company. Next step, be a little more patient with these people and give it a couple of days. Then called IRS to trace my funds. TaxAct has potential, they just have to use a little more professionalism and add a little more truth to the "fine print" for the customers paying to use their services!
I used TaxACT online and paid extra to have them review my 2007 tax returns (Federal and State). There was a huge error (we figure a computer glitch), but they didn't catch it. So my husband and I had to pay back $5,000.00 to the Federal and $500.00 back to the State of MI. TaxACT told me, "Oh, well, too bad, you were supposed to have checked it before you sent it through on e-file.” What did I pay them extra for? They wouldn't stand by their mistake. Please, don't anyone use TaxACT, they are not reputable and don't stand behind you. We got burnt because of them. I'm still so angry I could spit nails. They should be put out of business before they screw somebody else over! TaxACT isn't out any money, what the heck do they care, which they don't! I had to repay money to Federal and State. It put us in financial stress (bad enough the government made us lose half our retirement pension), and now this!
My return was rejected by IRS for a small error. Taxactonline indicated how to correct the error, but nowhere did they tell me how to access my return so I could make the correction. I spent over an hour going through all of their "help" and found nothing, not even in FAQ. Delay and absolute frustration.
I had my 2009 taxes done with Tax Act and had it direct Deposit on to one of their Tax Act cards. About three to four days, they put a hold on my account, so I called and asked them why they have a hold on my card. They told me they don't think I am who I am and asked me to send the following information: my ID, my 1040, my Social Security Card, and my Business Licenses. So I did and they tried to say that it was too dark and they closed my account. Months later I called back to see where they would be sending my funds at and how should I go about getting it and they told me if I keep calling, they were going to call the police. They also said there is no more need for me to keep calling because they were not going to reopen my account. So as of this moment I am planning on hiring a lawyer and sue them for my money and more! I would not tell anyone to use Tax Act at all! Consequence is that I had got so behind on my bills and had to move out of my place.
Taxact advertises a free federal e-file. They do not tell you that if you used the services a previous year, you aren't eligible. They also enlisted a bank (Republic Bank). This bank is not aware of any consent forms or claims on the form. In turn they charge you $15.95 for ERD direct deposit for the same time frame (8 to 15 days) as the direct deposit for no fee. I was told once the IRS accepts the application, it's out of their hands. This service is misleading and an inconvenience. Last year I received in 7 days.
First time user, I filed my 2008 Federal and State tax returns. I have prepared my own taxes for 30 years. I am self-employed and take annual tax classes. I encountered several problems resulting in many calls to Technical Support. After days of working through this, there was one form that needed an attachment and Tax Act does not provide that service. So I had to mail it in instead of eFile, which was my main objective. I still had to pay their full on-line fees. Now, Dec 2009, I am preparing my tax papers for the coming season. I discovered a discrepancy in 2008 return. Tax Act calculated business Auto depreciation incorrectly. They used the depreciation table and did not take into account the "maximum amount" that the Feds allows, which for Listed Property is lower. So the depreciation was too high. Also, none of my Auto expenses (gas, repairs, etc.) were carried over onto my Schedule C. I now need to amend my State and Federal returns to include 1040, Sched SE, Sched C, Form 4562, State Return. My estimate is over $800 overpayment to the IRS and $200 overpayment to State - that is, over $1,000 that is owed back to me. I have not received a reply to all my numerous questions to them. I am hoping they will back up their product and help me file the 1040X at no charge, but it is unlikely. They will not let me access my 2008 return without paying the Archive Fee. I would not recommend Tax Act to anyone.
I am a professional tax preparer who has been using TaxAct for over 6 years. I was contacted by several of my clients after they received a notice from the state indicating an error on their 2006 Maryland Tax Returns. Upon further investigation, it was discovered that TaxAct's 2006 MD State software contained an error. (A number that should have been carried over from the Federal Tax Return to the State Tax return did not, causing an an understated state income.) TaxAct was notified, provided with all applicable data, and promised to resolve the problem. One week later, TaxAct informed me that although their software did in fact contain a mistake, they would not reimburse any of my clients the interest and penalties that MD State has imposed. They informed me that I should have manually changed the number, even though their tax software specifically instructs against it. I am appalled that this company will not stand behind their product, and will not use TaxAct again. I strongly advise other consumers to avoid TaxAct. Hundreds of dollars in penalties and interest, which I am now forced to reimburse my clients.
I filed my taxes electronically through TaxAct on April 13. Since I have used TaxAct for at least 4 years I trusted my return would be sent safely to the IRS. Yesterday I realized I hadn't received my refund yet and went to TaxAct website to check status. Although they had my refund amount plain as day on their page (which wouldn't be there if I hadn't filed), my status read: "Not yet filed". Numerous attempts to talk to a live person failed; when I called Customer Service it was just an automated voice extolling their products,and then they hang up. I had paid $13.95 (debit) when I filed (or thought I filed). I finally called my bank and am taking legal action to get my money back. I informed the IRS as well of the situation am snail-mailing my return to them now. Thank god I don't owe; had I owed, I would have been penalized. It's a shame; I loved using TaxAct. I guess it's back to paper forms or a more reputable electronic filing company next year. And Edgar of Seymour, I was like you; I trusted TaxAct and had used them for years. Don't chastise Daniel of Maine, or anyone else for that matter, for being unhappy about a breech of trust and loss of funds in Any amount. Until it happens to you (and it might), you have no place to judge.
Paid for deluxe package, recieved crappy software that continually resulted in my return being rejected. Hours of phone calls and service emails later, I'm no better off, I now have to mail a late return. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!
I was able to submit my return online by the deadline last night. However, it was an unnecessary stress. I usually submit my return in Feb/March, so I have learned my lesson. Regardless, TaxACT Online should anticipate a high server load on the final day and be capable of handling that load. The errors I had to fix were with my 1099-R forms. The errors should have been detected when I ran the alerts prior to submitting my return.
First of all, it isn't free! And then when I asked them for a payment plan to pay federal taxes, their email to reply wasn't any good and the email was returned as no such email address. I was pretty confused when I was doing my taxes and they are of no help to me.
I filed my return early this morning. I received an email at 9:44 pm that my federal return was rejected due to some non-numeric characters. Shouldn't their software detect this? Since 10 pm, I have been trying to get on their website to correct the errors and resubmit, but the site is unresponsive. I wish I would have downloaded the actual software instead of using the online version. I've been using Taxactonline.com for years and have never had an issue before. I've read the numerous complaints on here and and I'm worried about the debit card complaints. I checked the PDF of my federal return and it does show my routing and bank account. I better not receive one of those debit cards once I do file.
I am unable to get access to my stored incomplete tax return for 2009. I've been trying for more than 2 hours now. They obviously have either insufficient computing power to support their customer base or they are having a severe networking problem. Also, there is no phone number to call to report this issue or ask for a status update on network availability.
It's April 14, 2008. I got a message that my e-filing was rejected. I tried to log in to Taxactonline.com to fix the problem and guess what? It has been 3 hours for me trying to get to their website - there is no way! I'm frustrated with their poor service. I understand it's busy but my roommate filed today with TurboTax with no problem. Taxactonline should be way more prepared for this day. I will never use them again. I wasted $16.95 for a service that I can't even get to in critical time where I have to catch the deadline. My roommate was happy with Turbo Tax.
Over a month ago, I filed with TaxAct online to receive a faster refund of my taxes and, instead of depositing this money into my bank account, it was deposited into a debit card account held by a company called Endeavor against my will. I have made repeated phone calls to both companies without any response. I am in the process of writing a letter to the company and requesting all documentation surrounding this situation.
Warning! Do not use TaxACT. My son used TaxACT for the first time this year and has had nothing but problems. His refund was supposed to be a direct deposit into his checking account; routing number and account number were given. Fees were paid. The refund was approved by the IRS. TaxACT ignored the information given and deposited his refund into an unknown account. This was discovered when my son checked the status of his refund. The IRS was kind enough to give us the routing and account numbers set up by TaxACT in our son’s name. Apparently, they decided to issue an Endeavor card instead of doing direct deposit as requested. Trying to get information from TaxACT as to why they issued this card was impossible. We have called 3 times and were given the runaround. We were told, “Supervisors are busy so send an e-mail. We'll get back to you.” Yeah right. The Endeavor card came today, and when activated, we found it to be about $70.00 short. We will try one more time for answers then file a fraud report.
I have used TAXACT online 3 years and no problems. MY earned income credit didn't match with IRS and they ammended delaying our refund another 10 days, but other than that I am still satisfied. I don't know where the card came in? I never received an offer for it? Refund was deposited directly to my account as requested. I borrowed money to be repaid from refund. I had addtional interest to pay for two weeks.
We have e-filed our taxes for the last 2 or 3 years with TaxAct and been very pleased. It was easy to do and very straightforward. THIS YEAR WAS A NIGHTMARE AND I WILL NEVER AGAIN USE TAXACT DUE TO THEIR DIRTY TRICKS! We prepared and filed our taxes as usual. Our state return was deposited in our bank account quickly but our federal didn't show up. We waited a couple of weeks and then began to look into it. We were told on Feb 27th that the money had been deposited on Feb 11th. Of course all kinds of red flags went up. We contacted our bank and confirmed that no transaction had come through. Contacted the IRS and they gave us name, number and routing info for a bank we have never heard of in Delaware that our money was sent to. Naturally, we were freaking out at this point, pull our credit reports, research this unkown online only bank (Bankcorp) and contact TaxAct. TaxAct looks through our info and confirms that, yes, the $$ should have been deposited in our account and files a customer service ticket and gives us an email address to also send in our own complaint. We even contacted the local police department to find out if we need to file a report for identity theft. Later, while straightening up I found a single sheet of paper with two credit looking cards stuck to it and TaxAct on the front. I remember getting the cards a few weeks ago and asking my husband if they had anything to do with our taxes because they had taxAct written on the corner of the sheet of paper. He said no and we assumed that it was some sort of solicitation. Thank goodness that I didn't shred them like I normally would have. I looked the paper over and sure enough, the cards were issued by the mystery bank that now held our return. I called the customer service number and was frustrated to find that it wanted me to activate the card before I could find out what the card even was. I used the old don't push any buttons and pretend I have a rotary phone trick and after 5 minutes of endless menus and repeating messages I finally got kicked out of the phone loop and was able to talk to a real person. This person informed me that by selecting direct deposit with TaxAct we somehow authorized them to set up a separate bank account and issue us the Endeavor debit card. Let me assure you that selecting direct deposit in years past has never resulted in a new bank account! I was stunned and angry to learn that they had already charged me $15.95 to set up the account for me, and that to get my money out of the account I would also have to pay a fee. I was told to go to my regular bank and they could withdraw everything but $5 from the card and that was the cheapest way to get my money off of the card. I am extra concerned about whether this bank account now shows up on our credit reports because we are looking at buying a house soon and I don't want on my credit record that I had some wacko account for a month. I am afraid that it will drop my credit score. This has been a nightmare and is a very dirty trick that TaxAct and BankCorp have come up with to eat into my tax refund with their dirty fees. I don't know how long it will take to get all of this resolved, but I really want my money back from TaxAct for setting up this account and then having to get my money out again. STAY AWAY, WARN YOUR FRIENDS AND FAMILY ABOUT TAXACT AND THEIR DIRTY TRICKS!
i filed my taxes wi taxACT and received an endevor credit card that i did not request. i gave taxACT my bank account number and routing number because i wanted to have it deposited in my checking account as i have done in the past. i called endevor to activate the card and find out the exact amount. when i tried to transfer the money, the bank said the amount was wrong and could only transfer 2,000.00 i decided to transfer the 2,000.00 and used what was left on the card for something else. i checked again the status of the card and found out endevor charged me $5.00 for the bank transaction. later i used the card for some gas and groceries and found out that for every transaction i made i was being charged .50. not only that, when i filed my taxes with taxACT they charged me $16.95 from my atm card and $16.95 from the endevor card.i sent them and e-mail because the phone number for customer service they sent was invalid. the e -mail from taxact said that i did request a credit card. so i asked them why then were they charging my atm card and again the endevor card. i never got an answer back.
I keep getting switched to a 2nd story software company who asks for my social security number upfront. I know that isn't right since it is already on file and all I should have to do is enter my user name and password . I used tax act online last year with good results, but do not plan to do it this year. None yet, but I am not allowing consequences since I am not going to use them again.
I used Tax Act Online to prepare my Taxes. I opted to have this money deposited in my checking account and I supplied them the routing number as well as my checking number. On the day my funds were to be deposited I received an Endeavor Card by Tax Act which I did not request. I have tried to get my money from this card to no avail. I have called several times and I asked if this conversation was being recorded and they said yes. These people not only charge you a fee of $15.31 as a one time transaction fee but when you go to an ATM If you can fine one that will accept this card they charge any wear from $2.50 and 1.95 on the other end to get your money anywear from 50.00 to a hundred dollars at a time. They claium it cost 5.00 to get a cash advance but it is 5% for this transaction. This also could amount to a great deal of money depending on how much you are getting back. I asked them for a check and they state the only way to get this to happen would be to request the account be closed and they charge 15.00 for this. This company is taking advantage of people that can ill aford to pay these fee's. Do not do business with Tax ACT on line. I have still not decided about what to do about this and I still no not have my money. This is money that I need to pay bills with and buy a few groceries. I am on Social Security and I can no afford these fees. I did not ask for this card. Please put these people out of business.
I filed taxes online using TaxAct, I opted for the Endeavor debit card because it comes within 7-10 of IRS acceptance of return. It is 12 days later now, the IRS already deposited the money on the card and still no card in the mail. I even paid the extra 15.95 for the debit card, they charge 2.50 every time I call and ask about the status of my card. They tell me it was mailed on the 10th, when my IRS return was accepted on the 2nd, so, how was it that I could get my card within 7 days? Dont think so. TaxAct is a fraud. I will never us this service again. They were lying when they said 7-10 days. It ruined my anniversary and Valentines day for the kids because they lied about the time frame that I would supposedly get the card in the mail.
I have used taxact online for years and have never had a single problem. It is a very easy site to navigate and I am very pleased with their services. Also someone complaining about having to pay 15.00 buck is [ludicrous].
To those people posting comments about how you've been screwed over by Tax Act... your reading and comprehension skills are not the best. The free part is for the PREPERATION, not the actual filing. If you are too lazy to print a copy of your federal return(and mail it in yourself), then you have to expect to pay a fee to have them e-file it. How do you think a business can make money, providing their services for NOTHING? The fact that they allow you to use their software for nothing, and even allow a print out of your completed return to file - for free - is a hell of a service! They only make money on the people who are too lazy to submit the return themselves. Also, the IRS has never recommended this site. They have simply listed them as a site that performs preparation services, including PORTIONS being FREE FOR THOSE WHO QUALIFY. None to me. I read everything - and do not expect anything for nothing.
To Daniel of Maine. I have used taxactonline for 4 years now and have NEVER had a problem with filing my Federal Tax returns. OH and BY THE WAY! TENNESEE does NOT have a State income tax so I don't have to pay the &7.95 for filing the State return as it clearly states. If you are having a problem with taxactonline use H&R Block or Jackson Hewitt and pay the additional amounts ane sleep well and complain about sonething that is really worth complaining about.
I have used TaxActOnline for that last 2 years and plan to use it again this year. I have NEVER had any problems with it. As others have stated, as long as you take the time to read all the questions and take care to enter information correctly (as you should with ANY tax preparation) it is very simple and fast to complete your tax filing. Also as stated before, the preparation is free but there is a fee for the actual filing the return with the government. That is clearly stated.
did my taxes and sent them on Oct 24th-paid what was supposed to be 16.98 to update the service to premium service including filing state and federal taxes via computer and getting a email when taxes were recieved and accepted. First both returns were rejected supposedly because the federal governement recieved both state and federal, they were sent again on the Oct 15th-and I never recieved confirmation and after trying for several days finally got back in my acct, and it said that the federal return was rejected becasue of the wrong tax ID number for my employer-I double checked the return and the numbers were correct and the taxes were sent again-I never recieved another email stating they were rejected-could not access the account again without paying a fee, could not print the return I paid for and now was late filing my taxes. I called the customer care technical number and was told since the last day to file taxes was 10/15/2008 that was the last day of the tax season and I had to pay to print out the return so I could send it to the IRS. The reps laughed and thought this was funndy, after becoming very angry finally let me talk to his supervisor, still laughing about it. The supervisor was no better so I asked for the phone numbers for the corporate offices and the president of the company and was told that I could not have them, all I could do was email a general complaint and they would get it to the president of the company. Of course this did not solve my problem. I was further told that it was my own fault for waiting to file my taxes until the lat day ( filed them one day earler and did not get a negative reply until late on the 15th. I do not know if they IRS will accept the taxes, or audit me because of the lateness. I am very worried, spent $10 to send the return to the IRS by certified mail. And finally called the credit card company and had the fee they charged me removed from my account.
I want to respond to the writer who said, I trusted TaxAct because it was recommended by IRS. I checked the IRS' official website. They have a search feature, so I put in the search term taxactonline. There was no search result-I don't think IRS officially recommends this company.
I filed 2007 federal and 4 seperate state returns. Me Alabama return was missing 2nd page and my return was sent back from state because of the missing form. I tried to get my Alabama return printed. Today 10/24/2009 I paid $12.95 to get access to my 2007 return. The only thing showing was on the other 3 states., of which 1 of those was wrong also. The Alabama return is my home state and very important. I trusted TaxAct because it was recommended by IRS. I was due a $46.00 refund. The key issue is I have not been able to send my completed 2007 tax papers to State of Alabama Department of Revenue. This will effect any future dealings regarding filing with State of Alabama.
I made a payment for $10 to my fed. income tax trough taxact They Charged my credit card, but never made payment . I'm being charged intrest, and will have to pay it myself. have e-mailed them and left phone# have gotten no reply! will have to pay extra $10 dollars+intrest
I needed a copy of a schedule C from my 2006 taxes. When I tried to access them from the tax Act I entered the login name and password, paid the fee by card number etc. printed out the order confirmation, ten pressed the "Access your 2006 Return" icon. a message came up that I had entered the wrong password AFTER they had the money. I entered the correct login name and password, could not retrieve or print any of my 2006 return which I had already paid for. When I called customer support I was given reasons for not being able to access my account including instructions beyond my technical comprehension which should have nothing to do with simply accessing what should be a simple switch to my file from the 2006 returns. I NEEDED this information as support for my financial file in refinancing my home. Not having it could cost me the opportunity to refinance at a much better interest rate. This blocking of help and denied access could cost me thousands of dollars not to mention the $5.95 access fee for which I was not served with the requested 2006 tax return.
I have used Tax ACT for several years. This year I was filing and there was a selection of charging the program cost to my credit card or having the amount taken directly from my rebate. There is no further explanation of this choice at this time. I usually pay for the program just to be able to import the info the next year. After filling out more questions and at the end of the process the program tells you that an account has to be set up at a bank and it will cost even more money than the regular fee. Yes, I could have gone back...back...back... and changed that decision and then I could have filled out the information again. I wasn't happy with Tax ACT at this point and thought it was kind of a shady way of doing things. So to add to this mess if you had the amount taken out of the refund your stimulus check won't arrive until July as a paper check. Poorly done Tax ACT.
I went to a web site tax act online. It stated that federal & state e-filing were free. I only wanted to file for my disabled mother so she could get the stimulus payment. Also she is due a refund from the state on her property. Well it showed the federal was completed after about 20 times going back and forth. The state would not go thru until I paid using my credit in which I did. They charged the deluxe package which was $22.95. I am very upset because I worked at least 5 hours and am keeping my fingers crossed that eveything is ok.
I have used TaxAct Online for over 6 years now. I READ everything BEFORE clicking the buttons. And I have NEVER paid a dime for anything. The site clearly states that the preparation is free, to e-file is more unless you qualify under the federal requirements. The only time you are charged is if you upgrade to other packages which of course have more bells and whistles...for the average taxpayer, probably not necessary. I always file my returnes electronically for both State and Federal and it never costs me more than $7.95. Which is a BLESSING considering my state refund is deposited within 48 hours of the confirmation receipt every year, and the Federal refund is deposited within 5 days of the confirmation. If you pay attention and print out ALL the instructions, you will see that you will get a confirmation from the IRS and the STATE that your return has been accepted. It is YOUR responsibility to be sure you receive those, if not you must go back thru and read the help instructions. Furthermore, if you DO receive the confirmation and the taxing agency says you never filed, all you have to do is send them the confirmation with THEIR document control number and you will not have to pay anything at all. Again, you must read the instructions. If you're not willing to follow the instruction to the letter on something as important as your taxes, then perhaps you need to spend the several hundred dollars to have someone else do it for you. In short, I love the software, I've converted over 25 people to the software who have NEVER had a problem in all their time filing. As with anyting in life, you only get out what you put in. I will use this online service as long as it is available.
Beware Social Security Benefit receivers. TaxAct Online cannot deal with the Stimulus Package requirements. I filed a Federal Return with less than $2000 in earned income and $17,000 in Social Security Income. Put these figures in their interview process. They filed 1040EZ which DOES NOT report Social Security income. I had to file an amended return. They offered to do this if I upgraded to Deluxe. Guess what? Ammended returns (1040X) must be hard copy mailed. They wanted to charge me $10 to fix their mistake and give me a form you can get from the IRS website for nothing! And their email support is so pathetic it is embarrassing. I called their support line and they have no intention of fixing this. TurboTax Online has it working fine. I just did a dummy return and it correctly used the 1040a, which does report Social Security benefits. I had to file an amended return so that I will get my stimulus rebate.
I received notice from the KY State Treasurers stating that I took a Hope Credit and a Lifetime Learning Credit for the tax year 2005 and that I will have to pay $487.02 and interest of $65.58 for a total of $552.60. I felt that Tax Act Online should have alerted me of the error but it did not. When I submitted this to tax act's guarantee they stated, "The entries for education expenses were entered by the user in both the Federal Q&A and the Kentucky Q&A as those amounts do not transfer from the Federal to the State program automatically. Since the program did compute the correct amounts based on the entries made, it is not covered by the accuracy guarantee. Thank you for using TaxACT. Please let us know if you have any further questions." What good is this program if it doesn't know if you calculated the same for the state as the federal?
Taxact advertised on the internet as being a free tax service. I went online to file my son's tax return (he earned less than $9,000)and the Federal return was free, however, when I wanted to prepare the state and efile them both together, they wanted $13.95. I paid it not knowing that this was a higher price than what was charged others. The federal refund went through without a glitch, however, the state did not receive the return until the day that the federal refund was deposited into his account even though I efiled them at the same time. When I tried to contact customer service I read that you have to have upgraded to the deluxe version in order to call their customer service number. I have since done my sister's return using the freedom Turbo Tax software (at no cost) and both federal and state were acknowledged as being accepted at the same time. I will ever use Taxact software again. Paid $13.95 for FREE tax software and waited an extra two weeks for state refund due to them not sending the state return in until the federal refund was received. This resulted in my bank overdraft.
I filed both 2006 & 2007 Federal Tax Return with TaxActOnline, because I was told it was free. In both case I wasn't charged a penny & had my return in 10 days! The only thing I found a bit annoying, as I went through their program, was getting pop ups from them asking me if I wanted to Upgrade to their Deluxe versionn. I just clicked on no & continue. I liked the fact it did all the calculations for me. It took me approx. 45 minutes to complete & file my return. I plan to use them again next year.
I filed my tax return with taxact on the 30 of january 2008. It has been one week and still no word on my refund. But that is not my complaint. I called the IRS to make sure that they received my return so it could be processed and they told me that they havent received it yet. I want to know why it has not been sent to the IRS yet? Can anyone explain this to me? Send an email or call me at home and leave message. I may have to refile.
I read the complaints that I have seen online. I just wanted to say that it is perfectly clear if you are familiar with efiling that you MUST pay for it. There is no free state filing. None of the sites actually do this for free. You must read all of the information thoroughly prior to completing then there will be no confusion, and doing any of this type of preparation work in a hurry is not the smartest of acts in any situation. Just a defense of a company (taxactonline.com) that I found to be easy to use and successful in my opinion. Thanks
I read your complaints from other individuals; and I'm sorry, but I think they were just in a hurry. If they were getting charged $7.95 for anything, it wasn't for filing. It was for one of the optional services that taxactonline offers. Yes, all the upgrade offers can be annoying, but hey, it's a free service. You have to expect the occasional ad. I filed my federal and state taxes with them; it was just as efficient as TurboTax or similar products, and it only cost me, as advertised, $13.95 for the state. When I used TurboTax last year it cost me well over $50 by the time I was finished. I have no complaints with Taxactonline. Frankly, if people are complaining about having to pay under twenty bucks, let them try an accountant and see how that works out for them! Suck it up, folks. I'm a happy customer. I just hate seeing people complain because they click the wrong buttons in a rush and then blame the service provider.
It was my first time using the e-file method, and I was kind of hesitant about it. When I went to the IRS web site and they said that Taxact was a good place to go, I filed with them. Yes, I got surprised my the fee at the very end, but paid it anyways because I had just spent an hour doing the whole thing. Then I received my confirmation emails, and paid no mind to it any more. Last week (4 months later!) I received a letter from the IRS stating that they had not received my return and that I would have to file again, and with late fees. I called TaxACT and they told me that I would have to upgrade my membership to be able to speak with customer service reps. to find out what happend. PAY AGAIN TO FIND OUT WHAT THEY DID WRONG?!?! That is ridiculous and a scam. I hope nobody else every uses them, so they aren't in the same boat as me. Thanks for SCREWING ME OVER TAXACT!
i also had issues with this website, i chose thwe simple FREE filing, only to input all info, and then save everything to return to it later, and then when i went back, i was in the deluxe filing, and was not able to comlete my return until i paid 9.95, then i filed electronically, and my return was rejected, and i now have to file by mail, and today is the 15th of April, will i get it in on time, I HOPE, and will I get my money back I HOPE will i get audited because of this issue,I HOPE NOT well the worry and the stress is way too much to deal with, and I just dont need any more stress in my life, especially around tax time
