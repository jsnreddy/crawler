WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER! I used Taxslayer last year to file 1040A. I completed my 2015 return and was ready to file and found out I had been upgraded, w/out notification or confirmation, to the basic edition and would have to pay $12.99. Apparently the upgrade was automatic when I selected a 1040A return because they no longer offer free filling of anything but the 1040EZ. I was not notified of the change, that I would be charged, or that my account had been changed/upgraded. I tried getting customer service via e-mail, getting only a computer generated form letter in response. I then called and after an extended wait received the worst (lack of) customer service I have ever experienced. I explained that I thought it was unethical to upgrade a customer account from a free to paid account without notification. I said that I felt that they wait till you have already spent hours doing the return to tell you you'll be charged because most people will just pay rather than have to start all over on another site. The representatives were rude, condescending and completely unapologetic. I spoke to a supervisor who had the same attitude. They said that there was nothing they could do and that they had no control over the site's design. I asked to speak to someone who does or another supervisor. I was denied and the employees would not give their names or even an ID number after I said that I didn't appreciate the rudeness, lack of concern and the fact that not one person had even apologized. I told them that had anyone been courteous enough to apologize or made any effort to find a way to resolve the issue I may have just paid the money and stayed a customer. That did not happen. After considering I decided not to support a company like this, who I feel uses unethical tactics to make people pay for fees/upgrades they did not want or were even aware they had been enrolled in. I used TURBO TAX INSTEAD! TURBOTAX is great they offer REAL FREE filling of 1040EZ/1040A & this they are also offering free filling for state returns! I was able to redo my taxes and file both my returns with TURBOTAX in less time than I spent waiting on hold and getting nowhere with taxslayer.
So I tried to file my own tax this year to save money (What a joke). I did everything right so I thought but it was a issue and wouldn't let me finish on the income section. The return kept coming back so the girl at Taxslayer told me to put a 1.00 amount to show I made this to get past income. It went through, but IRS eventually sent it back and what was the problem? The 1.00 amount that same girl told me to put. So I decided I would go to a professional which I thought that's what Taxslayer had. I contacted Taxslayer because they claimed they do money back if not satisfied (Another Joke). They told me to send in the letter that IRS gave me and a supervisor would review it. Well I had to contact them again over the internet and they finally responded. They decided to not refund me because they said it was for 2014 when it's clear in the letter it was for 2015. This company did not refund me and all they gave me was poor service on top of wrong information for my tax. So pretty much once you send your money to them you don't get it back. I will stick to H&R Block or TurboTax (The real professionals).
I did my taxes for 2013 and 2014 with no problem with Taxslayer so I file with them again for 2015. It didn't prompt me to enter box 12a and check box DD. Showed good refund. Sent taxes on 01/28/2016, still waiting. ERROR caused delay on tax return.
What gives? My oldest daughter filed and was charged $14.99 to get her state return and my younger daughter was charged $23.99. Then, I see that their basic is $12.99. Really, I do NOT recommend a service that is all over the map. Their process is not difficult, but it is a bit unnerving. Maybe I am spoiled with TurboTax (which I have used for years and will continue to do so for my own return). Hoping that their returns get filed at this point.
I literally signed up to this site just to complain about how bad and annoying Taxslayer is. Let me start off by saying it used to be free for military, a year ago, now you get 50% off... NOT the end of the world but it gets better. While you are going thru the process of filing your taxes, at the end you have to sign up for some cavista bank account, giving them all this information like your driver's license number and all that. I've never had to do this and I've used Taxslayer for about 3 years now (this being my third year) you don't know about all this till the very end after you press continue a bunch of times and then BOOM, they get you with their $5.00 bank return refund fee. -_- Really??? Anything to make a buck off of you. The only reason I stayed with them is because it took me almost an hour to file my taxes reading what deductions and what not I could before I hit the continue button a bunch of times to skip all the useless stuff, it's an hour I'll never get back just like the 10 minutes it's taking me filing this out. File your taxes on post for free, skip this website at ALL COSTS! Unless you're lazy. Taxslayer you failed me, you used to be awesome but now you're just as money hungry as the rest of them. One thing I can say about them though, is their customer service isn't bad. I called about a question I had and whoever the customer service rep was, she was very professional. So they're OK at least in that department.
TaxSlayer is not allowing me access to my last year's tax return on the basis that I do not have a copy of my ex-husband's driver's license. I gave them every other piece of highly important and private information accurately proving exactly who I was. They wasted hours of my time and energy only to tell me that I would not be able to have any access to them whatsoever. Very disorganized and frustrating.
Errors in their software and they won't admit it. Worked with their support team on two issues. Easy logical issues. 1. HSA accounts Form 8889 Taxpayers are entitled to an income credit for post tax money put into the HSA account. If you have one, then you qualify. Their software would accept my contributions but would not enter Line 3 which is the IRS limit for family which is 6650. This has nothing to do with your entries, it should be an auto fill in if you have made any contributions as it calculates your credit if you have put in post tax money, if only pretax money, well no credit of course. Couldn't get them to read the IRS instructions, just gave me boiler plate email answers. 2. A distribution for an Inherited Ira is not a income event as long as you follow the inherited rules. Despite entering in the proper dist code ID'ing it as a death benefit, it added it to the IRA distributions. Final story, go to TurboTax, they did it right the first, all the issues above were correctly entered and refund was greater than Taxslayer.com. Stay away.
I completed a federal return on Taxslayer on the 10th Jan 16 and noticed it would not be e-filed until 19 Jan. So the next day on the 11th Jan, I contacted Taxslayer and requested the action cancelled considering it had not been processed. I was informed that I would need to go back into the return and start the process all over and input my birthdate incorrect so the IRS would decline the return. Ok that was no problem, but when I ask for my $12.99 back, I was informed that Taxslayer DOES NOT refund any money whether the return is processed or not. Needless to say I will NEVER use them again. They will keep your money despite the fact they didn't provide you the service. This is not fair to the consumer and everyone needs to know how these people operate.
Like other reviews below, I too was lured in by Taxslayer's advertisement that the efile was free. When I went to efile and print my returns, I was billed $12.95. Don't use this company, there are other companies who offer a free efile.
I filed my tax return with Taxslayer in January 2015 and my return was due to be released on February 26, 2015. This was confirmed by the "Where's My Refund". I had not gotten a call or email or NOTHING saying that my refund was available. Remind you I e filed and made damn sure that ALL my banking information was correct. The IRS notified me that my refund had gotten adjusted and I am OK with that. So from FEBRUARY 26, 2015 when my refund was released to TAXSLAYER to APRIL 15, 2015 MY Refund had been in Taxslayer's Account. And I was NEVER told anything!!! I only found out about this through the IRS after I called them, then I called Taxslayer to find out what was going on. And I was told that they had "ALREADY SENT THE FUNDS BACK"!!! NOT TRUE. I've been in constant contact with the IRS and being told by Taxslayer that my refund was sent to San Francisco to the "RISO" DIVISION! And this is what I told the IRS and they're still investigating the issue... No MONEY has showed up in my account with the IRS YET.
Taxslayer fraudulently advertised free tax filing assistance but after giving information they charged me $17.95 which I did not pay. As a result they submitted false information to the IRS which tripled what I originally owed.
I used Taxslayer for the first time based on my boyfriend's previous positive experiences over the past few years. At first, it seemed fine for the federal return. But I never got a confirmation email. Then I tried to file state taxes but they told me I'd have to wait several hours until my federal e-return processed. Today (Apr 15 2015) I tried to finalize my state form. I accidentally clicked on audit support and went back to cancel it 3x but they wouldn't process my return until I paid not only the $28 state fee but the audit fee of $28 as well. At this point I was against the wall so I conceded and paid the $57 in addition to paying my actual taxes, but I felt extorted. Also I STILL don't have emails confirming from Taxslayer that my e-files went through. Common courtesy, people?! Hope I actually did file my taxes and don't get chased by the IRS.
When I went to pay for my e-file it kept rejecting my bank card and never completed my e-file. Later I was looking at my online banking and saw that they charged my account 4 times. They do not answer the phone and no response to an email.
TAX SLAYER PRO SOFTWARE 2013 practitioner professional software supervisors named ** and sales associate ** refused to give my 2013 client database because of my refusal to renew for the 2014 tax season. ** (sales Associate) emailed a zip drive link to my email (**) that can only be opened by TAXSLAYER PRO TECH SUPPORT. After being on the phone for at least 45 minutes with their tech support the software works temporarily and only allows the printing of one return and the software cancels. When a return call is made **, sales for a new 2104 software package is always demanded. When the software was purchased 2012 the cost was $250, 2013 $650 and for 2014 ** stated that the only package available was the $1250 package, which I refused. Taxslayer Pro is intentionally denying the 2013 software database I paid for in January 2014. The supervisor (**) stated to me on April 8, 2015, that I was NO longer a client so, tech support will be denied. In 2013-2014 I was a paid client.
From the beginning the website touted "FILE FOR FREE, START YOUR RETURN FOR FREE RIGHT NOW." So you go through the whole twenty five minute Q&A process then you get, "CONGRATULATIONS! YOUR RETURN IS COMPLETE! HOW DO YOU WANT TO PAY $39.79?" They assume since you've gone through the whole ordeal that you'll just fork it over. For SHAME TAXSLAYER!!!!!
I filed my 2014 federal return with Taxslayer.com in February 2015. I then looked into finding another means of e-filing my State return as Taxslayer.com was charging $23.90. I found out through my State's Revenue Department's website that based on income, my family qualified for a free State tax return, and Taxslayer.com was listed as a company with which I could do so. I then contacted Taxslayer.com Customer Support, and was told that because I did not initially enter Taxslayer.com via the link on my State Revenue Department's website BEFORE filing my federal return, I could not receive a free State tax return via Taxslayer.com. NOWHERE on Taxslayer.com was any notice given throughout any part of the sign in or the filing process of this very pertinent information. A message such as "Check with your State's Department of Revenue website to see if you qualify for a free return" certainly would be helpful and should be necessary by law. TaxSlayer.com's decision to withhold this information would appear dishonest, unethical, and bordering on fraud, as TaxSlayer.com would therefore be knowingly deceptive, withholding pertinent information, with the intention of profiting monetarily from those who qualify for and are entitled to a free State return. I had around four or five email exchanges with Taxslayer.com's customer support and they refused to offer me any help at all. All they did was inform me that their website states that State returns have a fee. This was not the question or issue, of course, yet they continued to patronize me in each email with this information. In the last email I received I was told they would send my issue to a higher department for review and get back with me. That was on February 10th. Today is April 10th and I've gotten no reply. I have since reported them to my State's Department of Revenue and the FTC for deceptively withholding this information. The fee to file for state is, as of April 10th, now $28.95 on Taxslayer.com.
Have used Taxslayer in the past. Went fine. Tried this year but can't get passed the date of birth entry... why? Because under "February" they only list up to 28 days. My husband is a leap year baby! Whoever made the updates to the website this year needs to have their work double-checked. Ridiculous mistake! Guess we'll be using another provider.
I am a Vietnam Disabled Veteran residing in the State of Wisconsin. Recently did my daughter’s taxes with TaxSlayer. The experience was smooth. After doing my daughter’s taxes, I made an attempt to do my own taxes. Upon completed the tax forms I notice that something was NOT correct. It appeared there was almost a $4000.00 mistake. The mistake was showing I was getting screwed on the said owed amount. After, exchanged Emails with TaxSlayer support, I discovered TaxSlayer program does not support the Line #46 Wisconsin Tax Form Eligible veterans and surviving spouses property tax credit. Meaning the guided (question & answer) fashion used by TaxSlayer fails to ask questions regarding this property tax credit for 100% disabled veterans. It is likely some disabled veterans like myself will be using TaxSlayer. They will be trusting TaxSlayer will cover all the available credits. This is clearly not the case. Disabled veterans will always feel they have been screwed by Uncle Sam. Now, a major tax filing service is putting the screws to them again. It’s just not fair.
First I want to say that I'm active duty so I use the military version for free. It is always difficult to know how to start a new year as there is no option for the military version but it works in the end for free. This has always worked well for me and I have never had any problems. I did read other reviews and people seem to expect too much or don't know how to use the system. One user said they couldn't review the return which is false. You can print out the return before filing. One user said that a professional found a huge deduction. Well a person is going to do better which is why you pay more. TurboTax is also not as good as a good professional. For the price - this works very well.
I am sorry but there is something SERIOUSLY wrong with the online program. Why would it keep saying I owed the State taxes of $3800??? When I got a federal refund of $3500! It makes no sense. Right off the bat, TurboTax gave me a state refund, and I ended up with a hefty state refund there. I tried to tool around Taxslayer to correct this, but ended up going to overpriced TurboTax. I also tried to contact Taxslayer. I am questioning whether the Taxslayer program gave me correct refunds in the past four years now.
I am extremely disappointed in TaxSlayer and their lack of customer support. I first learned of the free for military while deployed I used the TaxSlayer in 2012. When I returned I had a licensed professional review my taxes and learned that I missed a $2,000 deduction. I thought that was because of my mistake of not inputting items (even though I followed all the "walk me through it" links). Now it is time to file my elderly parents' 2013 tax return. Very easy, so I thought. When it came to review the return, the TaxSlayer system refuses to let you review the return like it would like when printed out. All they let you review is a summary, which does not include any deductions. Had they let you review the return before e-filing, I would have seen a gigantic error of $5 million in deductions!!! Of course, I did not enter $5 million in deductions. But TaxSlayer pulled this number from somewhere. I only noticed this error after I e-filed because only after you e-file (and pay the fee - it is not free) can you see the 1040 forms. Because it was after their business hours, I immediately sent an e-mail showing I noticed the error. I called at 6 am. However, the TaxSlayer told me it was "my slip of the hand" that typed in $5 million worth of deductions. I told her that was not possible. In fact, that portion of the computer program said it automatically brought forward numbers from a previous entry. And even if it was true that I erroneously typed in $5 million, the TaxSlayer system refuses the preparer to review the return before the e-file. If I could review the return beforehand (rather than the summary which does not describe deductions) I would have seen the error. TaxSlayer refused to credit me the expense for an amended return, refused to refund the filing fee. This is strike two - there will never be a strike three as I will not use their service nor recommend them to anyone. Please, TaxSlayer, this all could have been remedied if you permit us to review our returns before e-filing. And to make me a happy customer, credit me the fee for the amended return instead of making us pay $19.99 for an error I know was not a slip of the hand but an error when your system brought the wrong amount of money forward.
I used TaxSlayer to prepare my taxes and submit them for the second year in a row. While last year things went smoothly, this year State rejected my return. I looked at the statement that was provided on why it was rejected, and something with county tax was not added up properly. I checked my information and found it to be accurate. Assuming it must be some sort of glitch, I submitted it to see what happened again. No dice. I contacted their support and they confirmed that the issue was a bug on their end. They said they would look into it but gave no timetable on when I should expect to hear back. Wanting to get this done and over since I want to move on in life, I decided to try TaxAct, which was giving me the same refund amount as TaxSlayer. I used their software, the totals came out the same, and I submitted it. It was accepted this morning. I have requested a refund from TaxSlayer, but they said despite it being their issue, they do not give out refunds. Obviously an illegal business practice since their software did not do what was advertised. I will work with my card company to get my company back. I figured I would report this to others so they don't make the same mistake I did.
Tax Slayer stated they would check for errors before submitting my return to IRS and FTB. They failed to check my return and it was rejected. I contacted Taxslayer and 3 days later, I was given erroneous information to fix my return. I followed the directions given by Taxslayer, and the return was rejected (again) by IRS. This occurred four (4) times. I finally requested a refund of $25.90 that Taxslayer charged my debit card. They refused. I am currently filing complaints with various agencies about Taxslayer's fraudulent activity.
I was helping a friend do their tax return and I have over 20 years of experience. I filed single and no dependents, I put in all the W2 form information. I did not make a mistake. I printed out the return and Taxslayer gave him an earned income credit. I printed out the return and it says single no dependents. Unless a law in tax has been changed, Head of house with a qualifying child is the only way to get earned income credit. The consequences is having to file an amended income tax return for 2013 and having to purchase a money order for the amount of the earned income credit. The IRS is not going to be happy with this either. The friend of mine is single and has no qualifying child. It was a very simple return, only a W2 form for a single man.
First time using Taxslayer to do my taxes and I have to say didn't have an issue with them at all. I got my alerts on time, I had a rejection due to my own error and I was able to fix it and have it resubmitted to the IRS which only took 15 mins to get a response back saying it was accepted.
After filling out my information on another free popular tax website, I realized that I would be getting $5772.00 back, however, I was curious to see what Taxslayer had to offer. So before submitting with the other company, I decided to enter the same information on Taxslayer.com free software. In the end, they were only giving me back $4800. I felt like they were a rip off and what I learnt is that even though they are free, they are getting back their money from your returns, a whole $800 worth! Don't use them, they are very sneaky.
I have used TaxSlayer for 3 years. It worked well for me until my 2012 return. I received a sizable credit for putting solar panels on the house and entered all the data and it looked as if TaxSlayer got everything right. But as I was preparing for 2013 I looked over the solar credit math and the program did not enter my credit on my state form and I overpaid by $1000. I should have caught it last year, I know, but after 2 years of successful use I was lulled into a sense of complacency and overlooked it. Taxes are important. I want my taxes to be right. I will check them myself very carefully from now on but I will not be checking what TaxSlayer has done for me because as Mr. Trump says "You're fired!!" I sent them an email about it but do not expect to hear back from them.
I successfully used this program for several years. However, I guess they just got greedy. I believe they have attempted to stop unpaid use of their program and in doing so, have screwed things up badly. My experience has been similar to others described - wrong information no matter which family member's account I log into. Nonetheless, they have taken me for $22.50 this year - yet my return was rejected and can no longer be e-filed. I can't even get a copy so that I can mail it in! What a RIP OFF. CAVEAT EMPTOR - BUYER BEWARE! STEER CLEAR OF THESE CLOWNS!
I used Taxslayer for a few years with no problem. I paid to have last year's info pulled in and did my taxes, but somehow the fact that I was a resident did not register and I never paid city taxes. I expected a $3,000 return and instead got a bill with penalties for $800. When I wrote to the company, they wrote back that this is a self-serving program. The whole point was that I didn't want to have to fill out all of these forms myself. Why didn't I have this problem the year before when I pulled in the info if this was my error? Never again. Don't try to blame me when your program is inefficient. I already paid for 2012 and then was told I couldn't pull in the info from the year before because I didn't e-file. The info is right there on their computer and yet I can't pull it in. What a waste of money that was and now I'm paying a penalty.
I was working on state taxes for a friend using Tax Slayer. I entered the information and then we went round and round. I tried to e-file but it kept coming up with need to be reviewed. It reviewed and nothing was identified as wrong. I tried to figure it out. I tried and tried and nothing ever changed, same pages repeatedly and no progress. To say it was frustrating would be an understatement. I won't use it ever again!
I have used Taxslayer for many years with satisfactory results. I have a Schedule E to file, which has always been tricky, but I managed to get it done. This year, my tax return was rejected by the IRS because it lacked a form. When I tried to retrieve the form from Taxslayer, the form wasn't available. So, after losing $20, I decided to use my family's farm tax service. He stated the form they said was missing was not the one that was needed. The form I did need was not offered by Taxslayer. My family 's accountant also informed me that this year, if you reside in Indiana, there is a $220 credit per taxpayer that was not calculated on my State return. He saved me enough money to pay his fee. So if you have a Schedule E, I wouldn't advise you use Taxslayer. They also are not up to using correct forms or have the knowledge of all my State's new rules.
I began the free tax return, only to find out after completing the process that I would be charged fees because my tax filing status no longer fits the free edition. As a courtesy to users, they should notify you when the change occurs so you don't complete the entire process only to find out you're being charged additional fees. The Consent to Use Tax Information form is extremely irritating and worrisome. The e-file process cannot be completed unless you sign a consent form allowing Taxslayer to use and share your information to market you products. I don't need to sign up with a bank in Minnesota to receive my refund. I already have a bank that's why I'm completing my taxes online in the first place. This is the last year I will be using Taxslayer. Time to start using a professional service that doesn't want to be a NASCAR driver.
We did our taxes with TaxSlayer both years and just found out we owe over $2,000.00 when they gave us a return. None of my information was sent to the IRS correctly even though we put it in correctly. I don't understand how this happened, and nobody can explain. We are unable to get the copy of the transaction from them even though we paid for the service. Don't use the company.
I attempted to file our taxes after our son's taxes went through okay. For some reason, their site kept displaying our son's tax results even after I entered our password and user name. I made several attempts to get their IT support to reset something in their server/software, anywhere, so we could file our 2011 taxes to no avail. They kept telling me it was on my end, which could be so because I did what they said to do and it did not work. I now have to file very late and face the penalty, but it won't be after I also join the masses here and shout out how horrible their service is. Anyone looking to use online tax filing should be discouraged from using the provider Taxslayer. You may not get the results you expect. You definitely won't get proper support whether you call or email. It was only after all this time that I decided to see what other consumers have to say about them and I feel a fool to have put my money (which I now have given them for nothing) and trust in Taxslayer. This is the worst online tax filing service I have ever used. I too will be getting word to the IRS to dismantle their operation. They are not doing a just service to the consumer at all. So could it become the IRS problem if they know but do not do something about them?
I have been trying to contact Taxslayer through their email service since my state return was rejected with a 1025 error message. I cannot get into my state return now because of a log in issue. I have not received an answer for the last month from Taxslayer so my return cannot be resubmitted. I would like someone to get Taxslayer to contact me and help me resolve my problems. I would also like a refund on the price I paid for the state return.
I have repeatedly tried to submit my state tax paperwork and it is rejected each time with no explanation from TaxSlayer. I have also tried to call their customer no service number and it cuts you off every time. This is the worst tax website ever and they should be investigated for fraud! Do not use this service under any circumstances!
I filed my spouse (David **) taxes in 2007 and paid $14.95 via my Bank of America checking account. You cannot submit the form without paying the fee. I found out that it had not been filed and now we are responsible for paying back taxes. I called TaxSlayer and they reported it and why it had not been filed or submitted to the IRS. They stated it was subsequently my fault, although I paid for their services. I feel they dropped the ball and did not submit my husband's 2007 taxes. Can you help with this matter? We have tons of fees from the IRS now, due to their insufficiency.
I have never had a problem with them until now. I have been doing my taxes with them since 2006. No complaints whatsoever. Never been charged hidden fees or nothing like that. People should take the time to read through the programs and not make it a habit to click away through everything and anything. After I submit my returns, if there is a problem with the returns, it is usually rejected back to me for a chance to make corrections. I find all the stuff said above hard to believe. I love TaxSlayer!
I couldn't even print my taxes - calculations came out way wrong. I would have been in deep trouble; it kept asking me to sign to give my information to other companies. I ended up missing the tax deadline because I couldn't get things to work correctly. Took a chance, never again. Stay away from Taxslayer!
As a long-time user/customer of Tax Slayer, I am disappointed to report that on the evening of April 15, 2012, I was bumped numerous times from the website for unexplainable and seemingly illogical reasons. I was repeatedly prompted by the website to re-log in, and due to website glitches, as of the writing of this, I have not been able to complete my 2011 tax return. After waiting for 20-30 minutes, I was still unable to log in. To say the least, this experience is both unprofessional and disconcerting.
I looked up on IRS website recommended websites for Free Federal preparation with qualifying data for my son. On the Free federal sites connections with state designations were reviewed and because Taxslayer advertised no state tax fee also, I chose and prepared my son’s taxes. Federal was accepted. State was then allowed to proceed but before being able to send state, $7.95 was required contrary to original advertisement. The part that bothers me is that it was listed free state but then later after fed tax sent, then later we find out of cost.
Prior year copy 2010: My submitted $4.95 was accepted but no return was available. It just indicated there was an error and I have filled with Taxslayer since 2004. Needless to say, I will not file my 2011 with Taxslayer.
I filed my taxes with TaxSlayer. I got an offer that said I can file my federal for free and my state for only $4.95. Well, well, well, as soon as I was ready to file, I get hit with a $17.90 fee and a $29.95 fee. Not going to happen! Just because of their dishonesty, I am going to file elsewhere even if that means paying an extra $10. I am livid. What a waste of time! Also, I have to agree there's something about their software that doesn't sit right. Any way to permanently delete my account? I don't trust them with my information!
I spent an hour filling out all the info, all normal stuff no weird forms or anything. I get to the end and the State says I owed 622 dollars! So I played around for an additional half hour and it's still showing I owe $622. So I found a number to call, gave my info and for about 20 minutes the line was silent besides all the other call center people coughing. While waiting, I went to Turbo Tax and completed inputting my info. That site said I was owed 242 dollars. So clearly their software is garbage this year seeing as I've used taxslayer many years prior without problems. The help desk rep put me on hold after I told them Turbo Tax had the correct amount. After speaking with "her supervisor", she said that with all the info I inputted that it was the correct amount. What a waste! Their software is garbage. Do not waste your time with them this year. It's worth going to Turbo Tax for an extra 10-20 dollars and you won't get a headache and sore voice from screaming at them while muted. I'm disgusted. It's amazing that they couldn't help or fix their ** software. They just lost a lifetime customer. I will never use their software again. Stay away.
Taxslayer is a ripoff! I did my son's taxes, and used Taxslayer per my daughter's suggestion, and it really surprised me how dishonest they are. They should be shut down. They said federal would be free for my 19 year old son, and instead, they charged $4.95, $29.95 and $14.90. I will never use them again. I have used Turbo Tax for 10 years for myself with no problems, and I pay less in fees than Taxslayer. They should be ashamed of themselves.
Took my stolen SSN and let someone file taxes with it. What kind of verification do they use, if any? Whatever it is it does not catch SSN thieves. Months later I received a postcard asking me to use their service again. They didn't even take my SSN or personal information out of their system. I never received my 2011 tax return and the IRS said my tax return will be compromised for the unforeseeable future.
I gave it 1 star for ease of use. I started a 2010 return on 12/1/2011. I logged in two or three times over the next two weeks, to finish up the return. When I tried to log in again, around 2PM on 12/13/2011, the return was nowhere to be found on the website. Now, understand I had to prepay $9.95 in order to prepare the return. That morning, I had logged in, and worked on it with no problems. I sent an email to support, and got no response. I finally searched the website, and found a number 1-706-868-0985 to pro support, who transferred me to the .com support. I was then told that an 'executive decision' was made on 12/13/11 to discontinue the 2009 and 2010 software, in order to get the 2011 software up and running. I can understand that, but what I can't understand is that, they sent no notice to their customers, before cutting off the programs. Especially when they had already taken our money! I was told by Mary, who claimed to be a manager with support ID number 18, that a refund would be processed, but she could give me no confirmation number, or proof over the phone that I'd see my refund. When I asked and pursued the matter, she got nasty. I have been an avid user of the Taxslayer program for 10 years. I have even recommended it to friends. No more. I will switch to another program, one with some integrity. I will wait two days to see if my refund has been processed, and if it doesn't show back up, I will call back and try to find "Mary", and if I have to, I will do this every day, until my refund appears.
We just received a notice from the IRS that we are being audited and we owe them several thousands of dollars in back taxes. Come to find out, after paying the $4.95 to get into our tax forms, and another $10.00 for whatever, that we entered in our state refund from the previous year but it didn't figure into the AGI. This was a domino effect because it then didn't calculate with the Social Security amounts. I went into the system and it shows I entered the proper amounts but they didn't show up on the final forms. Beware, their software is not trustworthy, you risk being audited and owing money if you use them.
I went on taxslayer.com to get copies of my past tax returns and they are telling me that I have to pay $4.95 a copy for each year. This is ridiculous. I paid for the service so I should be able to access my own account/tax information. So, I tried to delete my account with them but there is no way to do so, so my private information is going to exist with them in cyber space forever. They are crooks and I want my social removed from their database. For others who are looking for a phone number for them (since they took it off their website so people can't complain), the last number I have for them is 706-312-3765.
I ordered and prepaid for my 2012 tax software in April 2011. A few weeks later, I decided to use a different company. When I got the check for my refund, it was shorted by $300. When I called to ask why, I got the runaround. After several weeks of being told that it was on management's desk and that management would call me to explain, which never happened, I got disgusted and decided to notify as many people as I could about them. They didn't notify me of such a fee and the software won't even be available until late 2011. So, what was the $300 fee for? In my opinion, they've become crooks! I worked too hard for my money just to have some company that didn't even do anything for that money, to steal it away from me! Watch out!
I've used Taxslayer for the past two years and never experienced being charged any hidden fees. Well, when filing both my 2010 return for myself and husband, we were mysteriously charged a $29.95 fee in addition to the $9.95 plus $4.95 for each state. We were advised that we chose a bonus option with University National Bank. This is completely false. We never agreed to this option, and every time I inquire through e-mail because talking to someone is not an option, they advise that I agreed when a 4-page form that I had to read and accept and was disclosed before continuing with the process. I completely disagree. There was no four-page document and their system was designed to agree to terms associated with their Taxslayer fees in order to print. I am convinced that this is a scam!
I'm old, my eyes are going bad and I admit to not being the sharpest knife in the kitchen. Now, I'm kicking myself for not coming here first, when I usually check out every new company I do business with on Google. A TV ad got me to Slayer, and because Turbo Tax charged me an extra fee last year, though I would try this company. Return rejected three times after taking off my glasses and putting my face to from my screen to make sure I made no mistakes. I suspect that they claim rejected returns to eventually charge more, but can't prove it right now. Now I'm worried that I will owe taxes in a few years from using this service? You notice on TS site, that they are very interested in getting your friends and family to use this service. Plus, you cannot use TS unless you enter a bank account # even if you want to pay with credit card. Does every other thing in America have to look crooked? Where is the compassion for old people now?
To avoid delay in my e-files due to IRS's technical problems receiving Schedule A, I tried to locate a telephone number on www.taxslayer.com and again after signing in. There is no number listed for contact and in order to talk to a person and get a telephone number you must upgrade to premier service for a fee of $10.00. I continued emailing support advising them of Federal Trade practices and finally received a telephone number. only to call it and still be advised that I must upgrade to premier status for $10 in order to talk to someone. I attempted to deactivate my returns since they have not yet been e-filed under they're policy. Since this is a current year filing and they can not e-file it until IRS fixes problems on their end, there is no reason I should not be able to deactivate it. I also viewed my payment history, being taken directly from my bank account for $9.95 Federal, $4.95 State and $29.95 bank fee, ridiculous but unavoidable due to the security number on the back of my bank card not visible any longer, and I found that there are two charges for the same amount of $14.90. This tax preparing service is way out of line by not providing a working number for consumers to contact them and by these erroneous double charge histories. I emailed my telephone number to them, and was told if I sent in a tax return before they e-filed and my e-filing through TaxSlayer was rejected for the duplicate submission, that whichever got to IRS first would be the return honored. However, TaxSlayer policy is that there is a non-refundable charge if the IRS rejects our tax return. This was not stated to me on the phone with the representative. This is fraud. I'm reporting this company to the Federal Trade Commission, the IRS and to my State's Attorney General. I have worked in law offices since 1987 and even being a consumer, I do my research into laws.
With the trusted site as it states, I file my 2008 taxes with TaxSlayer.com. However, I received a response from the IRS I owe huge! Due to the fact that TaxSlayer Software doubled and calculated my "Income Tax Withheld". I just enter my W-2 info. step by step on TaxSlayer.com, their Software did the rest. I submit it. It was rejected by 2 error codes, in which I corrected. But the error that now I owe a year later was not detected then by TaxSlayer nor IRS! I feel it's not my fault. It should have been detected/rejected or adjusted especially by the IRS. I cannot afford to pay this. I was instructed by an IRS Associate to take action and take them to Small Claims. I'm not the type of person that would do that. But this is missing with my livelihood. I might not have no other choice!
In follow-up and in all fairness, after my report on a bad experience with Taxslayer and no support, I have received a response and explanation for a bad IRS review. The problem lies in the fact that they expect the client to do worksheet calculations, unlike your local tax preparer. And if you don't, they don't question and submit unfinished information. So, you be the judge. If you want a tax preparer, maybe go elsewhere...
Taxslayer "free-file" was recommended by IRS site in 2008. Now in 2010, I received a notice that I owe over $4000 tax, interest on "unpaid taxes" since April 15, 2009 plus penalties. This notification, after when Taxslayer figured I had a refund, not a tax. I must now spend hours researching their errors, finding funds to pay the IRS (I am presently unemployed) and must also review my 2009 submission, figured by Taxslayer, to find more errors and hopefully reduce interest and penalties on that submission. I know the IRS will not show compassion for the fact the errors were not mine, even though they recommended this company, so I must join in the pleas made by so many others to remove this company from your list, IRS! The final insult is the lack of customer support to admit to and correct their mistakes. How can the IRS and Taxslayer justify their actions that have violated the trust we had during difficult times?
I used Taxslayer last year for my tax return free. It is simple and wonderful. This year it is still good to use for me since I don't know how to do it with standard 1040 form. But it charged me $9.95. It is not free anymore. Why?
I did not efile my tax returns through www.taxslayer.com. I used another software that has an excellent reputation for accuracy and integrity. Only hours after I received email confirmation from the proper software company that my tax return was accepted by the IRS for filing, I received an email notification from taxslayer.com that was sent to another of the email addresses that my tax return was rejected by the IRS. Such a commercial communication violates federal laws and constitutes a mail fraud crime. Somehow, taxslayer.com is tracking the e-processing of my tax return and is emailing in attempts to get me to sign into its software so that I can be charged fees, and I'm presuming that this would also impede the processing of my tax return, to my loss. Please report this to the US Attorney's office when you receive this message. Everyone else who has received such a communication from taxslayer.com should also report it to the US Attorney's office in their state. I have not responded to any of taxslayer.com's emails and I hope that I will not incur any adverse financial consequences. I am concerned about what kind of information that can "hack" into because they were able to track the processing of my return down and then find an email address to use to reach me.
This is a free service for filing tax returns for military members. Based on recommendation from my First Sergeant, I used taxslayer.com to file for my 2009 taxes. I'm 44, have been filing taxes for 27 years, and have never had a problem with my taxes until now. Unfortunately, something through taxslayer.com's web interface screwed up my numbers. My refund never arrived, and when I contacted the IRS today about it, they informed me the taxslayer.com webpage calculated our return incorrectly. Now, in addition to not receiving our refund in a timely manner, we owe a fee to the IRS for having to accomplish our taxes a second time, only now it's after the 15 April deadline. Never again, and I'll be sure to inform the entire base where I work to never again use this POS program for tax returns.
I used Taxslayer for e-filing my federal and state taxes for year 2008 and had no problems. I filed this year, 2009, and Taxslayer only reported state tax from one of my three W-2 forms. Taxslayer showed that I needed to pay my state $149. When you e-file with Taxslayer, you can't view your state e-file until your federal e-file is accepted and then a few days later when your state accepts your e-file, only then can you view your state tax return form. After reviewing the state return, Taxslayer left off $888 of state taxes that were withheld. TaxSlayer doesn't provide the ability to amend your state tax form online. So here I am doing my state taxes myself and getting a $739 refund! Thanks, Taxslayer for nothing! Let's see if they will refund the fee they charged for e-filing a useless state tax return.
Although I had used TaxSlayer for 2 years, this year I could not reconcile my Schedule A deductions with their figure. State taxes paid were supposed to be automatically pulled into the program, yet they weren't and customer support replied that their figure was correct. The reply was written by someone for whom English is obviously a poorly spoken second language, so I questioned their ability to understand our tax system and I went to another site. Done correctly. I owed fed tax of $954 instead of $1171, and received a state refund of $956 instead of owing $28 as per TaxSlayer. Fortunately, because I didn't blindly accept their word; instead of being out $1201, I'll come out $2.00 ahead. I just want this to go out as a warning to other people.
The Taxslayer web page is down and I'm unable to do my taxes. I am not able to get my return. I am not able to get my return.
I bought their software for my tax return for 2009. I ended up owing IRS big amount of money instead of me getting a refund. Upon line by line review of my return, I found out that their addition or formula was absolutely wrong. It was line 60 of form 1040 written as "add lines 55 through 59. This is your tax." I only have one entry in 55-59 which was $4836. However, Taxslayer's automatically put $13,339 in line 60 instead of $4836. Another thing, on the house mortgage interest part (1098), I placed the correct amount. I even double checked it before filling but again upon line by line review 1098 form revealed $1098 instead of the amount I placed which was above $10,000.
My taxes should have been simple this year. The only thing I had to report was $534 in unemployment compensation and $48 withheld by the IRS. I went through the steps and reported this income. The $48 tax showed up on the tax return, but my income of $534 did not. My tax return was rejected because my income showed up as 0 (less than what I was taxed). I am on a tight schedule because I'm also filling out a FAFSA. Eventually I had to just put a zero in the box for income tax and submit it. There is no phone number, so I was unable to get around this flaw. I should have gotten that $48 in a tax rebate, but thanks to Tax Slayer I won't.
I submitted my taxes through their e-file system. They took their fee, $9.95. I waited a full three weeks (although tax slayer claims that direct deposit refunds are received in 5-7 business days) before being able to get any information from the IRS. The IRS told me, they never received my tax return. When I searched for a phone number on site, I found none. I sent an email, the only option they leave available. The reply I got was obviously a robotic response. I think they expected me to pay again! This site was once useful for me, however I see that many others are having similar issues as I am having now. I have since resubmitted another email to their support team but I also plan to call the numbers listed for their URL registry first thing in the morning. If you haven't yet begun a business relationship with TaxSlayer.com, I would advise you against making to same mistake I did. Do not waste your time with them and do not let them take your money for nothing. I am out of work. This tax return was supposed to help me get through some tough times until I could get work again. Now my rent may be late, all because of a bad company!
I started to do my return based on the fact that the IRS recommended this site. I never did file the return, but was charged anyway for their service which I didn't use. There is no phone number to contact these people. I am out $9.95 for zero service, and I spent valuable time trying to resolve this.
I am very unhappy with this company. I started to file my tax return with them for this year. I go through all of the steps to finally e-file and they asked for a fee of $9.99 for federal and $5 for state so I enter my credit card information to charge after it is processed but they charged it right away. Also, my return was rejected with a code that says I have the wrong pin # or AGI. So I called IRS to get a number and it says I don't need one. I find my husband's number and file with his, but it still gets rejected. I asked a pro tax preparer what I did wrong and he said I filed as taxpayer this year but last year my husband filed as taxpayer and put me down as a spouse. Well, I tried to explain my mistake to Taxslayer and all I get is the same generic attempts to fix my problem, but I keep going in a circle! I asked repeatedly to have someone call me and speak directly, but no response. They have no phone number that I know about! What kind of business has no phone number? I really feel scammed and taken advantage of with this company. There is no name at the end of my email responses just a number, just "TaxSlayer support #72" or "#57". This company should be called out for unethical business practices. I have a three-month old baby and this has put an incredible amount of stress on my head to try and work out this problem.
I have used Taxslayer 3 out of 4 years. Two years ago, it would not work so I just used a different Efile. Please compare your results from other tax programs first. Turbo Tax gave me $600.00 more than Tax Slayer. I think it is because of the $800 worker’s tax credit. I don't know but I do know I compared line by line Taxslayer and Turbo tax. Federal was exactly the same refund. However, the state refund was way different. I am glad I tried it on both sites.
I went into the NY State Tax website, and they had a few options of software to use for free e-filing on my tax returns. I was eligible for it, so I chose the first on the list which is Taxslayer.com. After finally filling out everything, I wanted to send it. However ,they first made me pay $14.90! They don't even have a phone number, and I sent them a few help emails, but I got no response. I was so frustrated, because I wasted so much time, and I could have just done it myself, and paid a total of 44 cents for the stamp. I don't even know why the government endorses/uses them on their website if they are scam. They should be removed, so they couldn't waste everyone's time & money.
Website says $9.95 when satisfied, but I was charged on the spot. After I paid for the service, the website crashed, and I was told that my tax return was rejected and it had to be fixed through the website then resubmitted. Website is still down, and I cannot redo my tax return.
The ad states I would be charged when completely satisfied. The company charged my account for 9.95 and was not even capable to send the e-file to the IRS. That is not the right way to do this service. I may not even be able to file with or through Tax Slayer. Never again will I use this company. Tax Slayer drew $9.95 from our account before the job was finished.
Well, I filed my 2009 taxes with Taxslayer.com and let me tell you, since the new "Paid Work Credit" on their program, it deducts from your federal instead of adding to it as it's supposed to. ** is going on with this program? For single people, it's $400. For married filing joint, it's $800. So they owe me because now I have to file an Amended return. They are causing everyone who files to file an Amended return and shorting us out of money that we are entitled to.
I have such a similar story except this was my first time using Taxslayer. I keep getting rejected and not even a reason. I tried to contact them, to no avail, and now must start over with another website. I just hope that these people are not storing all of our SS number for their use. Something to think about! Well, I guess frustrated is saying the least. I can't describe what I feel but I do know that they took my money and I am going to call my bank to see if they will work with me on calling Taxslayer out on their scam. If I get anywhere I will post it and let everyone know how to recoup you money!
After several years of e-filing through their site, I was a happy customer. My problem began in summer of 2009 when Mr. E informed me via email that I had won a 4-day/3-night Bahamas vacation from Taxslayer. I did not believe him and was fiercely skeptical as I told him often. Shortly after the initial news, after several emails from Mr. E. insisting it was a real trip, I got laid off. For the next few months, we exchanged emails which mostly consisted of me stating that I was unable to travel because I was still out of work and that my friend I'd planned on taking with me on the trip was getting divorced and relocating to Hawaii. I was unsure when the vacation happen. He said not to worry, that I had a year to take the trip. In January 2010 (after 2 months of no communication from Mr. E.), I told him that while I still had no job. My boyfriend and I decided to take the trip because NYC has had a really harsh winter so far and we'd hoped on taking the Bahamas trip as a romantic getaway in February. This is when the trouble started. Suddenly the trip was no longer valid, possible or doable. I was steaming mad. Now both myself and my boyfriend are left out in the cold, so to speak. Of course, conveniently for them, Taxslayer's marketing team suddenly (for the first time) emails me some pasted "official rules" (which I never saw before) accompanied by an insistence that they did their best to accommodate me but that I forfeited the trip. Funny, in that email dated 1-25-2010, it even states the trip must be taken by July 2010. I just cannot fathom why a company would so viciously lie to someone who was ironically skeptical and cynical about the trip to being with. It is unfair. It is pathetic. I deserve a trip as promised.
I submitted my tax return this year and I keep getting error codes for AGI and PIN errors even though I confirmed with the IRS that all the information I entered was correct. There is something wrong with their software and I have not received any response from Taxslayer. They have taken my money and ran. I am left to pay for another e-file elsewhere.
Taxslayer has been horrible on forms this year. I have always used them in the past and used them this year. I had a basic return only utilizing their education credit form. My claim was rejected 3 times and finally accepted by the IRS and sent to the error department. It had like 4 errors that I had no control over and the IRS said it was most likely a software issue. I tried contacting Taxslayer but there are no phone numbers and no response from email. I am angry and now will have a delay on my refund due to their software issues. Do not use them for your 2009 return. Go to another site! My return is delayed being processed by the IRS due to errors and I cannot even reach anyone at Taxslayer for assistance!
Beware of their 2010 software. It is rejecting returns due to their own program error. Return was rejected and have not received any reply on the reject codes but was emailed back when I asked for a refund, they said no, it's not policy. It should be I got rejected because of their program! IRS stated all four reject codes were with submission of data! Beware. Use some other program this year!
To put it as simply as possible, do not use this service online or in any other way. Both 2005 & 2006, Federal (and subsequent State) returns were filed electronically and whole pages of information never showed up (at the IRS end) regarding capital gains. The IRS, in its infinite wisdom, did not seem to be able to communicate what was missing, so my communications with them dragged on for 2 years. The feds report to the state, so of course, they created their own mess. Threats of liens, actual attached wages and an emptying of my savings account were the outcome. The impact on my health and the underlying stress were quite extreme. I received zero assistance from Taxslayer.com. There was no availability via phone, no response to emails, nothing. I have resolved the issues entirely on my own and at great personal expense, both to my finances and physical health. I cannot express the frustration and stress that I experienced. Please learn from my misfortune. The IRS encourages you to file online, forget that! It's worth the wait to file via registered, return receipt snail mail. It may not be green and it may not be efficient, but at least you have some control over what is filed and with whom.
FYI - I prepared first with TurboTax, but didn't file because the state forms weren't ready yet. I went to the Dept of Revenue site, where I was directed to this site. I prepared here, got the exact same refunds of course and there were no fees. It would have cost me at least $52 to file with TurboTax. I even had my payment info all put in there so I'm glad I found this and saved that much money!
They charged me for tax preparation, which was denied. I can't find out why or get any support to answer any questions. Basically, they have taken my money and are now unavailable to further help me. I will have to get another service now to help me. A scam? It looks that way to me!
I went through the process to e-file and send my return. Then, it asked for my prior year AGI after I paid $9.95. Well, I couldn't get my prior AGI because this is my first time filing and since it was the weekend, I couldn't contact IRS for my PIN. Now, when I go back on Tax Slayer to put the PIN in, it says that I have to pay $4.95. How do I put my PIN to send in my return without paying for nothing?
I have many clients who use TaxSlayer.com to prepare their income tax returns and just love it. My own parents were impressed that they didn't have to pay to file their returns because of their ages, retired. They have to pinch every penny nowadays and this software was easy for them to follow and use. They got their refunds promptly, after electronically filing, and really like the software.
Poor interface and software errors in the TaxSlayer Federal/State tax filing product from TaxSlayer.com resulted in back taxes and interest penalties. Maine is peculiar about taxing teacher retirement that is exempt on Federal forms. Taxslayer did not account for this. When questioned about this, I was simply told it was my problem for not putting in the correct figures. Their software should have put in the correct figure from Federal to State. It could become quite costly for people making more money than I do who expect tax software to work appropriately for their state. Poor software, poor customer service, this company takes no responsibility for their mistakes. What they take is your money for a shoddy product. This is a sloppy product with sloppy response to an error in their software.
There is no phone customer support, when you try to call, all you ever get is a pre-recorded message Due to current call volume, we are unable to take your call at this time, please try your call again later. After trying to decipher a state reject code, which their site didn't help at all, the customer email support (who is only identified by a number), didn't help much either. BUt it's very difficult to try to help a person out with something as complicated as a tax return and software issues, when you are limited to email communications. Hence, the reason a real phone support service is crucial to fixing these problems quickly. I will be trying to file a complaint with the BBB and the IRS too, I don't think they should be allowed to have their site on the IRS link, that's why I chose it this year. They falsely advertise phone and message boards for support, and have neither. Then I get flippant responses from email support, with no names to identify them, only a number. Perhaps they are using prisoner convicts, or outsourcing this job out of the U.S., whatever they are doing, it [is bad]. I'm out $9.95 right now, unless I decide to dispute it. I'd be happy if I could just file my darn taxes at this point. I got my federal done, but their software won't allow me to go back in their site and efile my edited state return now, without disallowing the federal one I already submitted and got acknowledgement from the IRS. The stress is not good, esp when you feel like you are dealing with a non-physical entity that can basically blow you off, you are stuck. I'm half tempted to print out the Maryland forms now, and just file hard copy, and dispute their bogus charges. DO NOT USE THIS SITE, TAXSLAYER.com!
Deviated from regular software to TaxSlayer.com to save a few bucks. BEWARE state of Maine users. TaxSlayer does NOT take into account that your state retirement is taxable. Thought all was fine until letter from the State of ME Tax Agency arrived. Not only owed $500 back taxes but $50 in interest. This is a egregious deficiency on the part of the software and there are likely other bugs. BEWARE==communication with this company or complains gets you NOTHING. No further communication, just continued email spam to ask you to file again this year. BEWARE STATE OF ME and other states that may have specific quirky tax laws. TaxSlayer.com may not have this programmed into it and you will pay the price and stand alone while doing it. Back Taxes of $500 and an interest penalty of $50.00.
Their basic 1040 seems to add a few thousand dollars to itemized amounts (it's simple math for heaven's sake! - watch line 40). When I sent a support request, they are too busy and tell that if you haven't solved the problem yourself, ask AGAIN. You cannot get through to their phone support. I did get fast service when I delete my return and then they sent an email within an hour that said you deleted your return, so we can't help you. I would NOT use this service.
I have used taxslayer in the past and had no problems until now. I was preparing my 2008 taxes and my federal was rejected and I could not understand why. The rejection code was about a pin issue. I called the IRS help desk and they did not see an error on their end. So I resubmitted it again and it was still rejected. I called the number on the taxslayer website and it was out of order!! So I decided to upgrade to their preium package thinking I could get some tips as to what was going on. What I got was a customer service number that actually worked. After paying $5 extra dollars to upgrade. So the customer service rep said that because I had a negative agi for last year that the IRS had a problem with their system and are not accepting negative agi's electronically!! I have to mail my federal in! I am out of the $15 because they did not have anything about these issues on their website. I spent money on a service I did not recieve. I have to redo and submitte my federal in by mail
I saw the Taxslayer.com add stating free state and federal fill out of taxes and it would cost $9.95 to e-file. Upon e filing I tried to contact Taxslayer.com because they only filed my state not my fed and state. I was told to wait until my return was rejected and then print and mail my return! When I asked about the fact that I shouldn't be rejected and also I had paid them 9.95 to e file my taxes not print and mail them in. I wanted my money back if they were not going to be able to efile my taxes she told me the 9.95 was for being able to fill out my state taxes on their site! She told me I would have to wait up to one week for my state to be accepted and then I could file my state but I would have to pay 9.95 AGAIN! I thought she was joking, she was dead serious. They lie in theor commercial when they say efiling fed and state is ONLY 9.95 not to mention that on their website it still states that they are waiting on a response from state on whether my taxes have been accepted or not. When I tried to print my taxes to send them since they were running so slow the print out was 17 pages of scrambled words and numbers! I am not sure what to do at this point. I called and called I found out the company is in Georgia but that is about it! I will never use them again, I guess I am going to have to despute the charges on my debit card. Noting but false advertising and the run around DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME! I have lost money because of these people. Even though it may only be 10.00 to most people that is a meal in my household! Not to mention the amout of time I have soent trying to find out how to file my federal which I still haven't filed, next time I am going to an accountant. It's not worth the hassle dealing with these companies
I also had an issue with Taxslayer. It was difficult to use for Massachusetts taxes. There was no review before the form was submitted and once you submitted and got the copy, the income had been doubled because the input process was confusing. That is my issue with Taxslayer -- no final review of the tax form before it is submitted. Their help to me was to let me know I needed to file an amended return.
Used Taxslayer software for 2006 tax return. Got a letter from the IRS this year that I owed back taxes. After review of the tax return, realized the software added both the federal and FICA taxes together. I did not receive any notice from the software company of this issue at the time of filing. I had faith that using software would result in correct entries as that is why I use the software to begin with. Very expensive mistake in my view. Will never use the software again. Recommend to others to be cautious. 6K+ software mistake plus interest.
