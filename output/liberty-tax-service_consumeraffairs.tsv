I only got back 3279 and the preparer charged me 738 plus 49.95 I believe for a paper check to be picked up in the office which I requested direct deposit... I was asked did I have health insurance 2015 I said yes. And instead of her asking what type, she assumed I was through the Healthcare market which now have my taxes on hold and I filed February 1... NEVER WILL I USE THEM EVER AGAIN AND I DON'T RECOMMEND THEM TO ANYBODY.
After filing, was billed almost $700 because of the numerous forms involved. Taxes were not ready as promised... Had to make another trip to pick them up. To add insult to injury, the company ran my debit card twice! I protested and was promised it would be "taken care" of. Right! Another trip to their office. The clerk called her boss who (most likely) said, "Tell him it was mailed on Friday..." I told the clerk that I didn't believe that. She got real defensive and told me to take my complaint elsewhere. After 2 weeks, no refund for overpayment. I filed a dispute with my credit union.
I was charged 490.00 dollars to get back 680.00. Had to go back 3 times on the same day because the girl there kept making mistakes. It took her and myself with time almost 5 hours to get my tax paperwork correct. I was told that they were not giving the 50.00 dollar card away anymore, but the commercial on T.V. kept saying to come in for a 50.00 dollar gift card. I will never ever go back again. NEVER! Bad experience, too much time consuming and the lack of experience sucks. I will not recommend anyone to this place, if anything whenever I hear someone is going to go to Liberty Tax I tell them not to and explain what happened to me. Ripoff, scam and utter thieves.
My daughter decided to give Liberty Tax a try. She went to the Palmdale Blvd location here in California. She was told that someone had used her name fraudulently and that the long form would have to be filed with the IRS. She waited the 6 weeks like they told her to. My husband went into the place with her and someone told her that it wouldn't be extra for them to file. They had already taken more than half of her check in fees. Today she called to see if her check had arrived (it did). They told her that in order to get $180.00 she would have to give them $380.00 in fees. WTH??? We will be reporting them to the franchise tax board and to the BBB.
I filed my taxes with Liberty Tax on Jan. 23rd! It is now March 8th. No refund!!! I hate that I was suckered into the $50! The location I went to was extremely unprofessional! She was talking about obtaining a different job at a prison so she could find her a 'husband"! I felt unsettled being that my important information is housed at her job location! She then got irate, I next called the local police department on her **!! I will never file with Liberty Tax again!! ** them!!
It took almost 3 hours for the lady to do my husband and myself taxes. She kept getting information wrong. We had to explain over and over again the same questions. She messed our paperwork, charged us $488 and we never received the 750 advance.
Went in here twice! Should have TRUSTED MY GUT! I asked how much they would charge me to help me make sure my taxes were accurate and the woman told me they don't quote fees until they input your information and offered me a 50$ gift card. I told her I was a single mom and needed to stay within my budget (which I gave her) and I pretty much already knew where I stood and my budget. I didn't have all needed documents and she tried to still get me to file and do numbers and told me to GUESSTIMATE!! They are SERIOUSLY INCOMPETENT and DON'T KNOW what they are doing! They tried to SCAM me on fees after I told her my budget and LIED as well as telling me to "Estimate" amounts!! They tried to KEEP my documents and copied them!! I had to get seriously FIRM with them to get my documents back! NEVER GO HERE! They ARE NOT CPA or TAX Pros!! SCAMMERS AND Liars!!
Fine line between unscrupulous and fraudulent practices. Trust your instincts if you are concerned. I am ashamed I did not research them like you. I've done simple returns but now they are becoming very complex. I paid $4000 in taxes for 2013. I questioned my thoroughness. I decided to go to Liberty for 2014 returns and also a review of 2012 and 2013. I was told not to redo past returns because it would trigger an audit. I realize now that she had no idea how to do an itemized return. When I picked it up I began questioning what she had done. I was there 4 hours, late into the night. She screwed it up so bad I ended up with letters from the IRS for several months and finally received my refund at the end of August. I am ashamed I did not inquire about the fee. I was charged $800+. What?? I questioned the fee. She shrugged her shoulders and casually said she would cut it in half. I then realized I was being taken. It's a sleazy retail scheme. Quote a really high price, and then lower so the customer thinks they got a bargain. Next day I was in the ER because my family thought I was having a heart attack. After many tests they concluded it was a panic attack. High stress is not uncommon in my business but this has never happened. DO NOT ignore the reviews.
My dad and me decided to try Liberty Tax service and the one lady there took 2 hr 45 minutes to do a tax filing for my dad who is retired and only gets a pension and has a small mutual fund gain. The lady had to call someone about 4 times at least (I lost count) to get help to fill out his form and she charged $383. Outrageous, incompetence and ripoff. Never use them.
I went to liberty tax on feb. 31, 2016 to file my taxes. Let me just say People Be Aware. Don't ever go there. I was charge $600 to file. Which I ask them how much it cost. They lied and said $25, which is the bank they use fee. Then I was promise $50. Every excuse in the world. 'Oh the guy not here. Come back in a few minutes.' I waited. Came back 30mins. 'Oh he still not here.' They lie about everything. Let me add. The person who did my taxes. Didn't put me as head of household. So they had to do them again. I freakin hate liberty tax. Don't ever go there.
This is the third year having Liberty Tax in Waxahachie, TX to do my taxes. I had prepared Excel spreadsheets on all of my expenses in category for each expenses... The tax consultant never ran figures to check my accuracy or if each item was taxable. He just plugged in the numbers I had provided. After completion, he advised me that I get a refund, but owed Liberty Tax $502 filing fee. When I asked about the fee, he said that last year when I paid $50 that that was a promotional fee. He said that he had no control over the fee that is charged. Now keep in mind, I had done Excel Spreadsheets and he ONLY PLUGGED in the numbers provided. Also, he questioned an income amount for a bank from 2014 taxes and I advised him that that was not income but interest. They had to amend the 2014 taxes and I receive a refund. I had to wait for the amendment and it took me three trips to the office to pick up paperwork to mail after I had been told the amendment would be done the next day and I could pick up. This was on a Saturday and finally got paperwork on the following Tuesday. While in office the owner of the company was there and was asked for assistance from the lady trying to print the 2014 tax forms. He had also the same problem she was having. I waited for a long period of time and told the owner I would come back after running some errands. I waited and went back on Wednesday morning and was told that the person who filed my taxes would not be in until 3:00 pm that afternoon and I would have to come back. I went back on Thursday and was finally able to pick up tax papers. I had spoken to the owner regarding the $502 and advised him that I felt the fee was outrageous and that I could understand if I was filing a business tax return. He apologized and said that he would do my 2016 tax return for free. Now what is wrong with this picture? I will never use Liberty Tax again and advise anyone else to think twice before using this Tax Service.
Liberty Tax charged me $659-$150 (manager discount). I asked why the excessive fee, he said he used different schedule forms. I was in shocked and I told him that 2014 was less forms used and I was charged way less then. Never ever deal with them next year....
Let me start off by saying I only went to them because of the $750 EZ loan they were offering and let me tell you it's complete crap and a lie! I visit my local office at 6940 Lee Hwy suite 103 Chattanooga TN. I sat down with them and explained my situation on why I was using them this year as opposed to doing it myself like every other year! After I was through I asked what the criteria was for the advance and was told that they don't even know but I should be approved with no problems due to the amount of my refund. So like an idiot I went through with it. After they were done inputting all of my information which included 1 w2 I was informed that I would be charged $422.00 for preparation fee. Why in the hell did 1 w2 cost me that much to be filled. Well after she told me that, I again asked about the loan criteria because I really needed the money ASAP, in which again I was told they don't even know and again I was told I should have no issue! Well about 24 hours later I received an e-mail saying that I was declined. So I was robbed out of $422.00 dollars only be told I was declined for the initial reason I went there in the first place. Well after receiving my actual return I received an additional w2 that I had totally forgotten about. So the day I picked my return up I took the w2 with me and asked them what I needed to do about it. She then explained that we would have to file an amended return in order for the new w2 to be filled! I asked how much that was going to cost to do thinking it wouldn't be a lot considering the initial $422.00 fee I had already paid these crooks. Well I was wrong. I was told that it was an additional $180.00 preparation fee. So I asked could I file it and have the fee taken out of the return from that w2. Basically I was laughed at and informed that the $180.00 fee is an out of pocket fee in which I would have to pay before the amended return could be processed!! So when all is said and done I was denied for an EZ loan that apparently NO ONE was able to get, robbed out of $422.00 dollars, and now about to be taken for an additional $180.00. The total coming to $702.00 for them to prepare a total of 2 w2 forms. I will never,ever, ever be using these crooks again and I pray and hope to god that someone figures out a way to expose and sue the hell out of y'all!! Shame on you as a BUSINESS to prey on people who work hard all year and try to get an advance on their taxes a little early to help with whatever they need it for! Also how in the hell as a Business do you offer an EZ advance loan and don't even know what the criteria is?? I'm sorry but that in itself is complete and total **. I hope that my review will reach people before they end up making the same mistake I did!
I went to the Clemmons NC office and a woman named Kathleen did my taxes. I have 5 children. She needed all of their social security cards. We just recently moved and I explained they were in a box in a storage unit. I had prior years returns with all the children's numbers listed so they are definitely legit! She said they needed the physical card. Ok. I called the SS office and was informed the only way to get a SS card was to bring current official school transcripts. Ok, another trip. Finally after me driving around town for 2 days I was able to be issued new SS cards for the kids. My refund was just over $5,000 so I didn't understand why I would be receiving so much less. Kathleen said tax prep fees. I said "Well, how much are those?" I was thinking $200 MAX. She said $642.00!!! What!?! That is ridiculous. I felt so taken advantage of. I asked why they were so much. I had a simple return. Was that just their flat fee? She said it was because I had "so many forms". But I didn't, I just had a page for each child and the only thing it said was their name and SS number!! I felt like someone had just robbed me! I worked hard for my money and they did nothing to deserve $642! I should have just done it myself online for free. I feel like a donkey. Kathleen asked me if I wanted the $750 "advance" from my own tax refund. I had not heard of this and this was not the reason I went to Liberty. Liberty tax was about a 2 min drive from my home. So by default I went with them. Kathleen explained that I would just have to pay a $44.95 advance fee to receive that $750 the following morning. It sounded good, I figured I would just pay that week's bills with the advance. When I got home a few hours later I had an email saying my application had been denied. I didn't know I was applying for anything or that it could even be denied. She told me my check would be waiting the next morning! I called to inquire and was transferred to the manager Lynn. I wanted to make sure I would be credited back my $44.95 since I wasn't approved. She told me that the $44.95 has nothing to do with the advance and that fee goes straight to Regions bank so they can deposit my refund into my checking account. Why would they charge me almost fifty dollars when the IRS is direct depositing my refund into my personal account? So Lynn said she would speak with the owner because of the miscommunication to see if they could do anything. Guess what... she never called me back. The next day I went on the IRS "where's my refund" page. It said my return had been received and was being processed. A few days later I looked again and it no longer said that. I was concerned and called Liberty. I spoke with Shayla or Shana. I couldn't really understand her. She verified that it wasn't coming up and that was strange. She said she had to let Lynn the manager know and Lynn would be calling me back. That was last week! Still no call from Lynn and the IRS page has no information for me! I paid $642 for this?! I still have not received my refund! Don't go to Liberty Tax!!! It's a ridiculous scam. They prey on us.
I filed for 2014 and had questions since I spent half of the year living in NY and half living in Boston and they were so unclear about what I needed. They didn't explain anything they were doing and would not answer any questions they just typed types away, wouldn't tell me how much it would cost until the last minute. Finally, they asked for additional paperwork regarding my Boston filing as well as the fee which I recall being over $200. I didn't have either so I told them I would have to cancel and the insisted that we put it on hold until I can come back another day. I find out a week later that THEY WENT AHEAD AND FILED THE TAXES WITHOUT MY PERMISSION. They deducted the fee from my taxes which I thought they didn't do... And because they didn't have the paperwork they asked for, I got audited, my return was way less than I was owed and instead of getting three separate checks I received two and the third check just disappeared and I have yet to be told as to why. Seriously this place is an absolute joke. They need to be shut down.
Having a question about the tax returns last year, a chat was started. The response was quick but the employee did not answer the question fully then suddenly leaves the chat. This employee did not wait for a response at all, which was quite rude as the response given did not solve the question or even help relieve a tiny bit of the issue. On the other hand, starting another chat with a different employee showed that the chats could be helpful and not just a waste of effort. The site overall is not very good, as it signs out the user when going to the home page. This is not appreciated.
Went to Liberty Tax Service in new Albany Indiana on jan 28 2016 to have them to do my taxes and that was a mistake. They told me on the phone that they charge 250 to do my taxes. So I went there and the manager is the one that did my taxes. She didn't explain anything what she was doing. When she got done with my federal she told me what I was getting back then she did my state. When she was done she said how much the fees are $400 and I told her they said 250 and she pretty much told me that I was lying to her because she was the only one that was in the office that day. Paid it and I waited 4 days and check the fed and it was at the IRS. And then I called the state and it said that they haven't resent it. So I called the state, they said it was rejected. I don't know how long its been at Liberty. I go back and the manager didn't put in where I have paid rent all year. The bad thing is they didn't send my tax paper to fed or state till the January 30th. They said they was sending them as we was sitting there. I will never go back to Liberty again. I wouldn't go back there if they was the only place to do taxes. I would just not file then and just go to jail - that's how bad they are.
Liberty Tax Service allowed and encouraged my son's father to file taxes on 1200 dollars worth of made up freelance work with no receipts or proof of income whatsoever. He was able to claim our son as a qualifying dependent and also claim the EIC credit. He received 1***.00 dollars of fraudulent IRS money. I was supposed to receive 5***.00. Now I am forced to mail in my rejected tax papers with proof that I should have the claim on my son. I worked all of last year and supported my son fully with a W2 to prove it. I am head of household. His father did nothing but sit on his couch and drink beer. How is it even possible to file taxes on fake work? I wonder what these frauds would do if the IRS were to find out the unfair and illegal stunts they pull...
I have used Liberty Tax with no issues for the last few years. This year, I went in for the $750 "loan" that I had always gotten through them and was willing to pay a little more there to get the advancement than going to other places. I was told I would be getting the call within the next 24-48 hours to pick up the first check for the "loan" then would be called back within the next 2 weeks to pick up the rest of my refund as usual. I waited the 48 hours before calling to ask about the check and was then told it wasn't prepared that way and since the IRS had already accepted it, there was nothing they could do. I was highly upset as I would NEVER have paid $421 to file my taxes otherwise. I have 1 W-2, file head of household, 2 dependents and since I have used them for awhile, all my information was in the system, took the rep less than 30 min to complete. I waited until I had my tax return back before calling to complain to their corporate, I was told then that the filing fee was very excessive. They opened a case for me, with reference number, told me to wait 24 hours for the branch to respond and either the manager or the owner should be calling me to work something out due to the "satisfaction guarantee" they have. I called today after waiting the time frame required to be told that the case was closed due to the manager asking me to come into the store to "explain their fees". I have not heard from the manager since the day I called after filing and hung up on him then because I was tired of being told there was nothing he could do, so corporate is refusing to stand behind their guarantee as well and telling me to go the branch so they can explain why they charged me so much. I will be going to the store, but due to having the Satisfaction Guarantee, and I am not Satisfied at all, I think I should get all of my filing fees back and I'm sure I won't.
Office at Peninsula Blvd in Hempstead, worse services ever... It took me over a month to get my refund and after all that they charge me $725 dollar cause they max out my refund, but they never tell me how much it was gonna cost me... Never again.
Staten island Liberty Tax - Went there due to convenience of not having to pay prep fees upfront. Had to wait over one hour after they said it would only be a few minutes. Finally when I got in front of the guy could see he was in a hurry. Should him my last taxes utilizing itemize taxes. Last year got back $5000 plus. He did a 10 minute run and replied I was getting back $2000 fed and had to pay state! Handed back my w2 and said next... he did not have the time nor patience to itemize. Wanted a conveyor belt type. Never go there. Buyer beware.
The local office staff is nice to deal with. But the main office and their JTH Financial will lie to you about any and everything. My tax check couldn't be deposited in my GF account and the funds were never touched and check sent back to them and now I have to wait another seven days from today before I get another check in my hand. Both companies say that the bank had to see the old check before they can make a check cause they think I'm going to cash the old check. But I don't have it and I don't have it.
Liberty Tax in Jersey City NJ - The whole tax filing is fraudulent. First of all they are not organized at all! They are speaking very loud - everyone can hear everyone's business. The questions you have they can't even answer nor do they know the answer. The rate of my taxes was to be 6,**** after being denied for the 750.00 which I got over I received the card that was supposed to have the money deposited on NetSpend.... which charges you fifty cents every time you call to check because the young lady enter my email incorrectly so I couldn't check online. After speaking with the manager she could not fix it so that was my only way of checking.. No one informed me that I would not have it sent on the card, it would be a check that I didn't request. I don't know what the fees for that or any service I was given. Bottom line a mess. We paid for services that was not rendered to us without a option and what is supposed to be EIC or RAL is that 21 days to three weeks $595.00 in cost? I ended up with a check for $4800.00 just confused. I want in on a CLASS ACTION SUIT.....
Did not receive refund at all for the 2015 tax season. Liberty Tax Service is the worst company you have to deal with by doing your taxes with. I just people go somewhere else or hire a personal finance person to do your taxes, you better off. Liberty Tax put my information wrong. I never got my irs refund so far, I was supposed to get that on the 5th of February.
I went into Liberty to have my taxes repaired. When asked what the cost would be agent could not give me an answer. Once finished I was charged $300. I applied for a loan and found out that JTH Financial is not a bank!!! Please read the reviews, and think twice before using this company.
I was low on gas and needed to get to work which is quite a far distance and needed gas money so I went to Liberty Tax January 21, 2016 to receive the $50.00. They promised my refund within 21 calendar days. Today is February 11, 2016 and I still haven't received any of my taxes. I had gotten approved for the $750.00 in which I received in a check to receive it faster, the next day at the local office. IRS had sent out my check yesterday and I called Liberty Tax to ask about my refund and they told me that I will be receiving a check. I requested direct deposit and was still charged for the bank transfer fee. I called again today and still no check. They claimed that it was IRS errors and shutdowns, yet, I have nine friends who filed last week with Turbo Tax and other tax agencies and received both their state and federals yesterday and today. Remind you the IRS shutdown was last Wednesday. There is no way it was IRS mistakes. These people not only slack on getting people their tax returns in time and keep their word, but also lack morals to accept responsibility for their own mistakes. I will definitely prevent anyone I know from ever doing business with Liberty Tax. I would rather them go to a foreign tax service agency than to deal with Liberty. There is no reason that one should wait more than 21 days for a refund they've worked all year round hard for. This place needs a lot of things to work on and integrity is one. This is false advertisement and straight rip offs and yet, I'm surprised no legal actions have been taken against them, especially after reading many of others reviews on here. It's sad. I should've just borrowed the gas money from a friend. I would've been better off and stuck to Turbo Tax. But, next year will have a better outcome. I hope all learned from our mistakes and those who never dealt with Liberty avoid them at all COSTS, literally. If I could've continued this review with no stars, trust there would be a potato. Although, the staff were friendly I still give them no stars because same as con artists they all come with smiles and never hold up to their words.
Hello - I went to file my returns on Feb. 1, 2016. I gave the preparer my W-2's and on she went typing away. Then after asking important questions regarding my medical expense, child care, Student Loan and Earned Income with 3 kids she then stood up and walked over to the Manager. He came to her desk where I was sitting and took over. The manager sat in front of the computer typing away and not explain what he is doing. So I asked him same question and he stated that I have maxed out therefore, my refund was totaling out to almost $8000. He then explained to me NOT TO WORRY and that I am in good hands. He also said that I will be receiving big money and not to worry. I asked him how much I had to pay to prepare my taxes and he completely avoided my question/s. I must of asked him the same questions 5-10 times. He then raised his voice and was speaking over me and told with so much anger on his face that it was too late to cancel because he put it through the system already and because he had to make changes with different Schedule Forms he had to calculate the cost. FINALLY, he told me it was going to cost me $651. I just about died!! I asked him "why is so much" and he told me because I maxed out and due to the added forms he had to include. (WHATEVER THAT MEANS). I then asked him to have it deposited into my checking acct. He told me it's fast if I had it sent to Liberty Tax office. Again, I told him to have it direct deposited. Not too sure what is happening to my taxes if it's even going to be deposited into my acct. Waited a day or 2 and come to find out my return was rejected. I raised hell in that office and asked why my return was rejected. Liberty Tax Computer Error. My kids info. inputted incorrectly. HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE, UNSATISFIED WITH SERVICE. I have more to say but not enough room to share. "Any attorneys out there reading this please advise". I do not want any issues with the IRS. Thank you.
DO NOT GET YOUR TAXES DONE HERE!! I went in they were super nice about waiting on you. The lady did my taxes and gave me the $50 cash. I asked about how much they charge, she avoided the issue. It was not until my $ hit the bank that I realized they charged me $250.00 to do my taxes!! That is a rip off! How can these people sleep at night taking advantage of people who need every dollar! I had a simple tax return and wanted to make sure I wasn't missing anything by doing it on my own. This is what I get! I really hope that this company is put out of business!
THIS IS MY FIRST YEAR FILING WITH THEM. They help you at first but after are complete **! All my paperwork was wrong, they don't look at what you write down and when you call to ask about something they are completely rude!!! Stay away.
I went and did my taxes, thought the company was a legitimate business. They charged me 317 dollars to do simple taxes, I usually go to my family's tax lawyer but he was out of the way. Last year he charged me 150 dollars and Liberty Tax Service charged me 317. I wished I asked how much they were going to charge me. Not only did they charge me an outrageous amount, it will take about 21 days to get my returns. My tax lawyer got my returns back in less than 2 weeks for 150 dollars. Do not conduct business with their company unless you like throwing away your money. I do not blame the lady who prepared my taxes. She was very kind, unfortunately, she has to work for such a terrible company.
This will be my second year having problems with Liberty Tax Services. Last year I filed my taxes with Liberty and had to have them amended because my tax preparer last year filed my tax return as if I owned my own business and charged me $700.00 to do it and I don't have a business at all. So when I called Liberty and talked to the man who had prepared my taxes, he said he would have to charge me an additional $75.00 for the proper paperwork to amend my tax return and he then tried to talk me out of filing an amendment saying that the IRS would audit my return. But at this point I wasn't trying to hear anything he had to say and I amended my tax return anyway and three weeks later I received the rest of my return in the mail. I now know that I made one of the worse decisions in the world by going back there again this year. Now they're under investigation and me as a hard working tax payer I need to know what steps to take to get myself out this mess.
I went in to have my taxes done on my business and they wanted me to prove everything I spent and did. After they did all the work they told me I owed them 500.00 for doing them and I also owed the IRS 800.00. I said "take it out of my taxes" and the man said "that can't be done." I would need to pay that upfront or the IRS wasn't giving me my taxes. Now they had told me I couldn't get the 50.00 for coming in and now they got my taxes papers on hold and won't send them in till they're paid first. I asked for them back and they said I can't get them cause they need them for their records. My friend went in and he got the 50.00 but they charged him 399.00 for the taxes and told him they can't send his in. I say don't deal with these people cause they're running a scam seems like.
I just filed my taxes with Liberty yesterday. The only reason I went was to take advantage of the supposed EZ 750 advance. As I suspected, I didn't qualify. The funny thing about it was that the rep could not tell me the requirements. My credit is good and my refund was over 5,000, so what could be the problem? It's a SCAM. I usually file my own taxes and pay about 70 bucks for state and federal combined. Liberty charged over $500!!! That advance is just a way to get you through the door so they can overcharge. The lady who helped me was nice and all, but I felt like she was asking too many questions for no reason. She even asked for a copy of my son and my insurance cards. Wtf!?! The experience was not good and I will never ever ever go back to Liberty. In my younger years, I used to go to H&R Block and Jackson Hewitt and paid about 300. I got raped in tax preparation fees unnecessarily. Don't go to Liberty!!! The only good thing was that I did get the 50 bucks they promised, but that's nothing compared to the money I spent for them to file. Smh.
DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY AT LIBERTY TAX. Here's my experience so far and this is my first and last year with them Ever!!! So I get in there and fill out the tablet for my information, was kind of skeptical about this place but I said "Why not? Extra cash on hand and let see what the estimate they come up with, hmmm". So he shows me the total, didn't break it down. He just told me after everything what I will get. So I said "Okay let's do it." We get to the end of everything I guess I'm just sitting there. Why he works the computer doesn't walk you through anything!!! So I'm ready to give him my paperwork for proof of socials, he assumed without asking me to go home and get 'em but I said "I have 'em with me." "Oh okay." He make copies, next I'm ready to hand him my bank info for direct deposit, he says "O we do paper checks," wth!! So I was def finding out why I never bothered coming to this place. I was not made aware this no DIRECT DEPOSIT. Suspicious now until the final end after he finalized everything. Last but not least they do not give you all the paperwork that YOU'RE SUPPOSE to get for your info... Fast forward I receive my check - wth again!!! I called the office "Let me pull your file and call you back." I waited and called them back. By this time Charlie who is their SUPPOSE TO BE MANAGER that definitely made me aware he works out of the Junction City KS branch calls me. I discuss why the amount is different than what's on my paperwork, he says "Well you should have this sheet showing your state and federal total," I say "I don't," he says "Well I can't see or have no way of knowing what paperwork you may have or don't. I can't just drive to you," "I didn't ask you to," "Well we can't keep going over the same thing about" - WHICH IS ABOUT MY MONEY... "Oh okay sure," recited his sarcasm back to him and hung the line... WARNING: Do not do business with Liberty Tax Service even if you're in a desperate situation. I will be reporting this business!!!
I called Liberty Tax Service to see how much they would charge for a simple 2 form tax service. I was quoted 150.00. From the start when I showed up, did my taxes, was never given a break down of fees or prices. After she did my taxes handed me a envelope and said "Have nice day. Your refund is $ amount." Come to find out I was charged 495.00 on a 1200.00 tax return with. They straight out rob people. How can this be?
Hi, my name is Aretha **. I filed my taxes at Liberty Tax in the Bronx. They did my taxes. When they did them I made 3000 and I was getting back 2525. After they took out the money for the 3000 then when I got my taxes back I got back 1600. Then they tell me that's what I made and they took the fee out of the 2525 for the tax preparer and then I called and they said that I only made the 2525 for the year and I have the paperwork on how much I made. I have 3 papers that have 3 amounts and the person that did them no longer work there at that site. Please don't ever file your taxes at Liberty Tax. They are ripoff.
I will never use Liberty Tax again nor would I recommend them to anyone. They advertise that you could leave with $750.00 the same day you file your taxes to lure people in, all the while knowing that no one gets approved for that. Then they charged me $508.00 to file my taxes (which were a simple forms) without any explanation as to why the fees were so expensive. They charged extra money ($44.95) for direct deposit to their bank but I didn't not receive direct deposit. Terrible experience with them. NEVER AGAIN will I use them as a tax preparer.
Today February 8 my son went to do his tax. Some friend took him to Liberty Tax and when he come back I'm ask him "how much they charge you?" and he said "they don't told me and they don't given any paperwork." So I went and I ask if he can cancel and they said no so I'm ask how much money he will received and they shows me the paper. He will receive 444 and they charge 282. I'm get so mad that I told the lady "how it possible that you going to get more than him. He will receive 195.00." Be very careful with this company. Ask before they do something how much they are going to charge.
My daughter's boyfriend went to Liberty Tax service today. He is from Africa but has been in the U.S. for four years. He just wanted to see them about his refund. They took his W2's and kept them. He has a French accent. So they took advantage of him. He came home and showed me. I seen the charge of $900 and another $45.00. I told him to go back and get his W2s back. They told him NO. So I went back with him and told them to give them back. They took a photocopy and tried handing that to us. I became very firm. I really was prepared to call the police. I can't believe these places. I pay $60.00. And I have a longer tax form. If they try anything with his taxes we will go to the IRS. NOTHING BUT A RIP OFF. He speaks 5 languages and help train people to live the American way. If that is any indication. They should be ashamed. I was and it wasn't even my taxes.
Well the moment I walked in to the office, I should have turned around. First off I asked upfront questions. 1. How much do will your cost??? A. Computer generated. Ok here is my w-2 s 4 of them... Numerous questions 42 min. later. My taxes are filed... 1,189.00. I was charged by liberty 398.00 for tax preparation. 44.50 consultation fees. My remaining fund was... Wtf. I ask for my paperwork back... They kept portions of all my forms explaining that they needed for their records... I noticed when I was walking into the camera is pointed right at my face so I remain calm picked up the few pieces of scrap of paper that I couldn't take and left the premises. That was my experience last night 2-6-2016.
The Liberty Tax Services $750 Advance Loan is what is referred as a RAL or "refund anticipation loan". This service is offered through Liberty Tax franchises and backed by Republic Bank & Trust Company - Louisville Kentucky. Be aware that this loan has fees that are stated in the Easy Advance Application and Agreement and it was explained to me that in order for Liberty Tax Services to submit a Easy Advance application they must first submit the IRS fillings for approval. Once the IRS verification comes back then the Easy Advance application is submitted. If this process is accurate it would mean that Liberty Tax has already filed your taxes and the applicant is committed to fulfilling the Liberty Tax Service agreement. IRS taxes can't be filed and approved without signatures. In my case I went through the process as I was told and explained in little to no details regarding the actual process, at which time I was declined for the Advance Loan yet still charged service fees. Suggestions:(1) research the company, (2) be prepared with all required documents, (3) have them provide you with a writing signed estimate of services based on documents you provided, (4) never sign any agreements until they have confirmed with you that you understand and have read documents completely. (5) Lastly; your tax service specialist should be thorough, transparent and personable. (Final Thoughts) The Franchisor is responsible for overseeing the franchisee and making sure that they all follow a specific protocol.

My husband and I went into Liberty Tax to file taxes. Usually I would file with H&R Block online but we are newly married so we decided to have them filed. Also they had the 750.00 advance promotion going on. The rep that was assisting us and told us that the amount that we were getting back would be sufficient enough to qualify us for the loan. Of course we were desperate and we needed to pay rent. We went forward with the process and then found out that we had to pay 422 to file. That's over 10% of our refund. Got the call a day later the next day that we were declined for the 750.00 and still got ripped off out of 422.00 and still don't know why we were declined. Will never use Liberty again!!!
So now I filed on Jan 20. And was told that anywhere from 7 to 21 days I should get my return back. It's been 3 weeks and no news - not even the agency called. They get upset and say no checks are here without asking for any info. The price they charged ridiculous. Never again. Good bye.
I have been a consumer for 8 years of Liberty. This year my fees double totaling to 916.00 in fees with no explanation or plan to adjust the fees. I will not be filing with this company ever again nor will I recommend anyone use a service that would want to charge you nearly a 1000.00 for services.
First time at Liberty. Needed that 750 loan. Was told that I could walk out with 750 then she took forever. On top of that she did all the paperwork and printed it out and put it in the folder, didn't even tell me my refund. I asked how much she charged me and I was told that if I need a paper showing my refund I would have to wait until it's accepted my refund then go back for a printout. I should of never filed with them. Bad experience.
We went to have our taxes prepared. We waited forever. They called someone in. We finally start the process. Well we paid taxes to the state we lived in 2014 only need to file for NC. They at some point added both states. Said we were getting a refund for state put in the direct deposit information. Did fed return. Okay. Not good but okay. Then ask if we want to apply for the loan. Told we qualified. Sure why not. Then we were informed of the cost which is more than last year by 200.00 from someone else I wish I would have went back to. 550.00 for a simple one w-2 return. Went home. Two hours later they call. “We’re sorry your state isn't a refund. You owe that.” Two states totaled 1,900.00 dollars. They did get one exempt like that was a favor. It shouldn't have had that state in the first place. Once the state was figured out they didn't call us to see how we wanted to pay those taxes but they went ahead and entered banking info. That was provided for a return of taxes. Well as that stands not even one week later my bank account sits neg 1,024.00 and we get direct deposit so now we can't even supply grocs for our kids. TY. Oh and it’s not over yet. We didn't get the loan either. You can only get that if you filed with them last year and got money back. If you apply for the loan you can no longer get your direct deposit. That's how they get their money back for the ones who do and don't forget that 44.99 to apply. And for those of you who didn't have it explained 21 business days not 21 days. Can't count those weekends. Everyone needs to also go to BBB online to file a complaint. Have the office address you used as these places are most likely franchises. And for the lady who they didn't return your W-2 if she didn't finish your return and you didn't sign anything you need to call your non emergency number to the police department. She can't hold your W-2 if you didn't complete the return or sign an agreement. UPDATED ON 02/08/2016: Well as said we filed taxes and it was a big mess up and not knowing anything about taxes. We came from NC to Va but the company continued to pay NC taxes and they did file our return and some shady practice but we called around and spoke to several Liberty tax offices. Found one belonging to a different franchise and they were helpful. We spoke to someone and they sent us to see a general manager who is extremely knowledgeable in taxes. What should have happened with state is VA should have been filed. We still would owe because they didn't receive any money and since we paid NC and didn't live or work in that state they owed us the money paid to them. This general manager showed us how to adjust our tax forms for next year to hopefully not owe as much. Mind you we still have to deal with the screw-up but if you believe there is a mistake look into it saved us 1,098.00 dollars and they're supposed to remove the fees for the state filing it is not over yet. They have amended the state but we will see. Protect yourself, gain a little knowledge about taxes and make sure your preparer has knowledge. Ask up front about fee.
I did my taxes with them and I work for Walmart and she didn't give me my discount, and I didn't know she didn't tell a lady called to do a survey. Also they did not give me the option of direct deposit or nothing, so they charged me $45 to get a paper check. I will never use them nor will I ever recommend them to anyone. And they charged me $412 to do them.
I was overcharged once they got to the fees of $622. I was unable to refuse the service. Instead of the $50 cash out the door, I was offered a $122. Reduction in fees or the cash. After seeing the price I opted for the fee reduction. Then I didn't qualify for the refund advance of $750. So I have to wait for the IRS to process the return. So I paid $500 for nothing. Have to wait until it's processed. I'd have been better of using TurboTax. Was hoping to get the $750 advance to go see my son for his birthday next week. Scammers! They offer $50 cash out the door and a $750 advance. Got neither. Just the $122 off instead. So I'm waiting, as if I had filed myself except less $500 and feeling like I was ripped off. They got 1 star because zero wasn't an option. Buyer beware! Didn't go in with a trusting feeling. Was far worse afterwards. Never again, once and done.
This was my first year ever filing taxes. I am a 21 year old, single woman. I have 3 W-2's because I've slowly worked my way up and gotten better jobs throughout the year. When I went in I filled out my contact information on a clipboard and went to sit with the lady who was to file for me. She didn't ask me any questions about anything. Typed in my W-2's and then when I asked her for my approximate tax return before the fees were taken out she said $370. That was her first lie. The amount she quoted was after they received their fees out of it. They charged me a total of $338 to do my taxes. They didn't tell me about the $44.95 fee or their fee per W-2. I had been contemplating becoming a tax preparer myself and going through their class. I now know that I will not be going through Liberty Tax for anything. They gave me $50 and handed me a sheet to give out to my friends to receive $50 on each of them and I really needed the $50 right now. It's the only reason I went with them. Now I would rather of just borrowed money from a friend. I got my return cut in half because they refused to tell me how much they were charging. When I asked to do a long form she said it wasn't necessary. I thought they were supposed to do what the customer wanted.
I went to Liberty Tax to get my taxes done only because I wanted to try to get the advance. The tax preparer had no clue what he was doing. I do taxes myself. I only went because of the advance. They didn't tell me that you had to pay the fees upfront in order to qualify for the advance. Then they could not even print out a copy of my return for me. They also filed my state by paper without my consent after lying to me about there was a glitch in the system and they would e-file it later. I called to see if the return had been accepted. They told me to come in to sign my state. I get there, come to find out he did not know that you can transfer info from fed to state. They don't EVER have to worry about me again.
I'm a single mother of three who ended up going to Liberty for their $750 dollar advance, and I too was denied. After doing some extensive research on the web, I realize that this is a swindle and a lie. Even worse, my preparer was this young guy who had only been doing taxes for 6 months, and I could tell immediately that he didn't really know what he was doing. I felt uneasy and lacked confidence in his ability to get the maximum refund, but their assurance of this $750 dollar loan kept me there. In the end, I was charged $600 for a return that was less than $3,000, and declined for this loan that should have been extremely easy to qualify for. I've since learned that the loan is not borrowed against your taxes, but rather it is determined by a set of criteria that will get most people declined and has NOTHING to do with your taxes. I filed taxes with more paperwork at HR Block and was charged half the price the year prior, and the year prior to that. I'm really mad about the $600 dollars I was charged and do not feel it was justified. For that amount they need to secure a system that appropriately borrows against people's tax returns so there are no declines. Not to mention they don't offer direct deposit which is INCREDIBLY weird, and I was not told about this until my taxes were complete, which I will be calling corporate for. Oh, and when I said I wasn't sure about completing my taxes there, they took $25 off the $600 fee and assured that most people had no issues with the loan, and reminded me it was interest free. I shouldn't have listened. I should have just left. Now I sit on pins and needles wondering if this fellow did my taxes right and if they'll be back in time. This place is inconvenient, and definitely not here to help you. I am upset with myself for going there and actually completing the process. Not only was my preparer somewhat unprofessional, but the other two women in the office gave off a very negative energy. I would never go here again. NEVER. I feel they swindle people who are down on funds then wash their hands of you when they're done. I would say just don't file here at the Viscount location in El Paso, Texas, but I suggest you avoid this company entirely no matter where you are. DO them yourself on Turbo or try HR Block, but avoid these $750 advance places because they are not legit.
Basically they will tell you what you wanna hear and then after you file they don't wanna talk to you at all. When you get upset they tell you they have your refund and you're not getting it. Apparently Jennifer only works one day out of the week and only she can help you. They are a true scam artist.
Liberty Tax is incompetent and unqualified to prepare taxes unless it's self-employment. I used them this year because I been using them for the last 4 yrs and I don't like my info all over the place. I referred my sister and her husband and the employees they had there didn't know how to prepare taxes for people who own houses, cars and other write offs. I'm currently in the process of finding a new preparer. I can't do business like this anymore... It's not worth it.
Went to have 2016 individual taxes prepared on January 29, 2016. The preparer, Eric **, who we were told did NOT yet have a CPA license, took 2 hours to prepare a simple return. When we first sat down he immediately told us we were his last customer since he was leaving for Ft. Lauderdale, FL for the weekend. He never asked to see a social security card at any time during the preparation of the taxes. Several attempts were made to compute the taxes with the help of 2 additional employees, one of them being the owner, Chris **. While the 3 of them made several attempts, my son asked about the state taxes for Pennsylvania and Alabama included on his W-2 forms (2 in total), which Eric had completely ignored. The owner said several times, "I'm going to fix this". Many attempts were made by 3 different individuals for over an hour. In the end we were told he would be getting $231.00 minus a fee of $166.00 for the preparation and an additional $45.00 handling and processing fee which we were told, by phone, was the fee for their bank to process the refund. After many attempts to finalize his return we were told his refund amount would be $20.00. His total income for the 2015 year was $15,000. During the entire time sitting with them there were many interruptions, the preparer's cell phone was continuously ringing and there was limited, if any, privacy. We were also told that as of the time of filing that Pennsylvania and Alabama State taxes could not be filed as of yet... with no factual reason as to why. This is outrageous! I would sincerely appreciate your response and would like to file a formal Complaint against Liberty Tax Service immediately. This local franchise needs to be audited and shut down. Thank you very much. I will anxiously await your prompt response.
DO NOT USE THESE GUYS!!! They charged my daughter-in-law $536.00 to do her simple tax return and when I called the office to question it the office manager said, "It none of your business" and hung up on me. I tried several times to contact the home office with promise of getting a callback, NOTHING.
I am a single mother with two children. I have always received my tax return. Last year I did Turbo Tax with direct deposit and got everything back. This year I received a card in the mail from Liberty Tax stating I could get 750 loan towards my return the following day. The Tax preparer assured me over and over I would be able to have this amount. The fees were going to cost me and I was willing to pay them based on the fact I needed the money upfront. I called on the day I was supposed to pick up the 750 towards my return and they told me I was declined that their bank declined me and that I should call the number on my return and ask why. Well, after realizing that I knew there was no way the IRS could do such a thing and that I was desperate to get money upfront, I knew I had been swindled in on Liberty's way of gaining more business. I would not call their bank only to hear the same story. Now, they tell me I have to wait the full 21 business days for my check and even told me that they didn't have direct deposit which I found suspicious as well. I called them several times only to be talked over because they knew I was onto the scam. I could have filed with Turbo and had my return direct deposited and gotten all my return quicker. I was intrigued by the fact they sent a card stating I could get part my return next day. I have nothing that can cause me from not getting my return as I get one every year. They are lying to people to get business and promising something they can't deliver. Because I believed in what they were saying, I now am losing 400 dollars my money that I worked hard for over a fraudulent scam. This is illegal what they are doing to people. I have called them several times and asked if anyone is getting money upfront and they replied many people have. That is a lie. They also told me to pacify me that next year I don't have to pay any fees at all if I file. Why would I do that? They lied to me to rob me. I am seeking a lawyer to expose this fraud and I want all my money back. I'd like to know how many other people they told the same thing too. They won't get away with this.... If I don't get all my money back I'm taking this forward to expose this corruption.
Was promised I would be able to apply for loan until I signed everything, then she tells me I don't have enough of a refund. At one point, the lady who prepared my taxes had to turn the monitor towards me and give me the keyboard to input information due to the fact that she wasn't good with computers and didn't know this software that well (even though that's her job). I was also GUARANTEED THAT I would receive my check within 21 days of the DAY I went in there... Still showing no process on where's my refund. THEY also charged me almost 100$ more this year versus last year even though last year I had over $3,000 more on my return, and it was a lot more complicated last year... I only had one small W-2 to file this year. Someone tell me how to report to the BBB.
I filed my taxes with them last year and again this year. Last year I had several w-2's and was told that they charge per w-2. This year I had 2 and was charged over $500. That's more than I paid last year with 5-6 of them. Then the lady kept saying, "We have to inform you of the $44.95 fee. They're really big on us making sure people understand this fee if for having us take the money out of your refund. You don't have to pay this if you pay the fees now." Really I don't have $500 to pay up front for my taxes. I was expecting it to be around $200 since I only had the 2 forms not over $500. I was there maybe 10 minutes. What a rip off. I will be using TurboTax or similar from now on and pay less than $100 to have my taxes done. They are taking advantage of people by charging them so much. It's ridiculous.
My husband and I went there a week ago. The girl that was doing it didn't know what she was doing and keep asking me weird questions. After being there for 2 and a half hours with starving kids I told the girl "Never mind." and to give me all my information back and she refused to give me, my husband and mine W-2s back. I called corporate on Friday. They said someone will call me back in 24 business hours and haven't heard anything back. So, don't go to the one on 19th and Uintah in Colorado Springs. They are crooks and shady. I'm so mad that they will not give back our W-2s!!!
Went to Liberty Tax due to a financial bind. They advertise on the radio and by flyer that you can get $750 within 24-48 hours once the IRS approves your return. They charged me $300 for preparation fees and $45 for direct deposit. Within 9 hours of my appointment, I received an email that said I was declined. After some research, it seems JTH Financial is not a bank, but an LLC owned and operated by Liberty Tax. They will prey on the desperate, and not blink twice. DO NOT USE them! Look at all these negative reviews. Please learn from our mistakes.
I've used them for 2 yrs and the second years someone in that office on Stanley Ave in Brooklyn used my identity... They did nothing to help the situation. They also charged too much to prepare your tax. They are the worse.
Liberty Tax lure me into getting them to prepare my tax return with the promise of a $750 Refund Advance, not a loan secured by your refund itself, but lied the terms to get the different in writing in promotional. Then what they after they do your taxes, disclaimers not cited or in writing a fraud and treat to do taxes. My 2014 & 2015 incorrectly prepared by Liberty Tax. Had another tax place verified. Called tax check.
Never again will I use Liberty Tax Service. They are ridiculous!! The lady Ashley lied and ran a good game on us. My boyfriend and I filed at the same time and we got a 750 dollar advance. It's been almost a month and people are getting their state checks and I have yet to get mine. I called up there to speak with them. They kept saying we'll call back, we'll call back and they never did so I blew their phone up. When I finally got to speak back to Ashley she lied and said she explained the advance and that I wouldn't be getting a state check (which is a lie, she DID NOT explain this to me) then continued to explain all the fees! OMG!! They took my ENTIRE state check and then said I still owe them money and they will be taking it out of my federal to which the fees she explained are way more than what she told me when I initially filed. Liberty Tax is FRAUD! They just want their commission and their money. DO NOT, I REPEAT, DO NOT GO TO LIBERTY TAX ON 63rd and State Avenue KC, KS! NEVER EVER AGAIN!
I went to Liberty Tax in 2014 by Fordham rd, Bronx, NY & they were giving $100 on the spot if you file your tax return with them. So I did, at the end the lady tells me ok, here's the deal, "It's $700 for filing here and since we give $100 here, it's your choice if you don't accept the $100 today, we will knock $300 off your tax bill so instead of paying $700 we would only charge you $400, but if I give you the $100 now then we will charge you expect 700." That's a rip off - what they do is put the 100 in their pocket and they're not supposed to... And $700 to file a return, are you kidding? My friend went to Liberty too, and she was charged 500 and we both had the same papers. They like to rip people off. I will never go to Liberty Tax again!
Liberty tax make a mistake and they admit, one of their employee fill my tax. Now I owe 1700 to the IRS and they didn't do anything to help me. They charge me more money on another office same name ''liberty tax'' but after I pay she tell me this company is a franchise and she talk real bad about other ''liberty tax?". Anyway she say after I pay, everything is ok, well not. IRS send me letter I still owe the money. Liberty Tax ruins lives.
Liberty Tax offers EZ Advance (750). I asks of the requirements before filing. I was told I met the requirements. After filing I was charged almost 600$, then received an email that I was denied for the advance. This is a advertisement just to get you in to be overcharged. Ripoff/Never ever again.
Do NOT use this company! We are deeply in debt to the IRS due to the fact that the flunkies at Liberty did not correctly fill out our tax return. And of course upon receipt of the ever dreaded letters from the IRS demanding money, proceeded to deny any wrongdoing (stupidity) on the part of their preparer. I wish I could wring someone's collective neck, but unfortunately I am too busy scrambling around trying to figure out how to pay the IRS. This company hires total idiots as both preparers AND so called 'managers'.
DO NOT FILE YOUR TAXES WITH THIS COMPANY!! They are a complete rip-off! My taxes were filed wrong and I'm now getting letters from the IRS for re-payment! They will not honor their office "audit assistance guarantee" to pay for the interest and penalties that have resulted from their wrong doing, and forget about corporate CUSTOMER service as they are rude and absolutely no help at all in getting the issue resolved. Definitely think twice before paying Liberty Tax almost $400 for SCREWING up your tax return.
Signed up to take Tax Preparer Course at Liberty Tax Service in Wichita, KS located on S. Broadway for employment purposes. They were notified I am legally deaf disabled veteran and needed interpreter until I got hearing devices. The instructor refused to accommodate us during class and kicked us out when I said I could not hear and interpreter requested they speak up. After informing them of my rights they threatened imprisonment by calling police for being deaf. Please boycott Liberty Tax Service!
Please read this before you use Liberty Tax Service located on West Liberty Avenue in Dormont, PA. I used this service in 2013 for the first. I should have realized this company was a problem from the first time I walked in. It is absolutely filthy. They completed my taxes and a year later I receive a letter from the IRS indicating there were claims on the tax form that were not allowed. I am being charged over a thousand dollars and the interest is being applied from the time the federal taxes were filed. I took my IRS letter and taxes back down to Liberty. 1 manager of this particular company is a smooth operator. He tells you all kinds of things he wants you to hear and does absolutely nothing to follow through. He tells me to pay anything, they will check into it and if there is any money due they will pay it if it is their fault. Well that was 3 months ago. I have called several times and no one answers or returns your message if you leave one. I contacted the IRS and they recommend I go to another place and have them look over and refile the federal taxes.
Liberty took our w2 and was suppose to file an extension and never did. Now we have to get new w2 and other paper work. None of their phone numbers worked and no one ever showed up at the office. Then they had a sign on the door saying they had moved but never said where. Now we are having trouble getting the stuff we need to do our taxes.
I filed my taxes with Liberty for the very first time and I truly feel like they tried to swindle me for too much money for filing my tax returns. They failed to contact me on info on my returns as well as they took weeks before they even returned any of my calls with left messages about concerns regarding my returns. Why was it taking so long? They messed up my paperwork. They didn't put me down as single when I'm head of household, never asked me if I was going to get direct deposit. They gave me no copies of the paperwork I submitted to them. The only papers I received from them was some referrals and a paper that stated my return in the amount of $1,960.00 and the IRS told me that my return was $2,736.00. I feel that I was not informed properly and they were very unprofessional. They were trying to get to swindle me for more than $800. I feel that that was dishonest of them. They didn't even give the person the $50 for referring me to them and they filed with them last year. The money that they so make this big old advertisement about is all a scam. They are liars as well as thieves and I would never use or recommend them to anyone ever again.
Accountant filed for an extension. We completed our taxes on Aug. 9, 2014. On Aug. 11, received our return paperwork stating "Your federal balance due is 2742.00. Your return has been filed electronically. You should not mail your return to the IRS." So I mailed a check the afternoon of Aug 11 with the form I was supposed to send in. Received a letter on May 18th stating a Credit of 2,742.00 but that our return was never filed. Called 1-800-829-8374 and spoke with an IRS worker ID# ** who stated someone tried to send the return on October 15th but it did not go through. At that time I was instructed to send a copy of my return to IRS which we did with new signatures on May 19. In July we get a letter for a penalty for failure to file, failure to pay proper estimated tax penalty, failure to pay penalty and interest charges. Total due 792.52. Called IRs again, spoke with worker ID# ** who stated the charges stand because we didn't file on time and that I had no recourse with the IRS. I would have to call the accountant. I paid the 792.52 on July 9. This worker also stated someone tried to file electronically on Oct 15 but it didn't go through. Called the accountant who stated "Oh I can fix that." He faxed a letter to the IRS which I also had him fax to me. This was not a legal form. Called the Headquarters of Liberty tax service and told them we should be reimbursed. We did not hear back from them. Called the accountant again this AM. Didn't hear from him. Called Headquarters again, gave them an ID# from our first call and the worker said if we did not hear from the accountant by Mon, to call them back and they would take care of it. The accountant lied by sending us a letter stating that our taxes had been filed. For this we were charged 792.00, which we should be reimbursed for, not to mention 41/2 hours of phone time. Just may take this matter to small claims court if it is not resolved soon. So much for trusting an accountant who lied. Next year maybe we should do our own taxes.
I have been waiting for 4 and a half hours for the Liberty Tax supervisor in Vacaville CA to come. After an hour and a half drive when they say they'll have my check. And nothing. I've called over and over again office and corporate and no answer. The person working tried to fax my actual driver's license through the fax machine. No one knows where my check was printed to or who printed it. They don't even know who said to have it mailed after I got through to corporate. They haven't offered no reimbursing for gas nor the time they told me to come get it. I'm very disappointed in Liberty Tax in which I have done my taxes through them for 4 years now.
I had my 2012 taxes done by Liberty. In August of 2014 my daughter was having trouble getting her FAFSA completed and I was told to go to the IRS office to get a transcript of my 2012 return. They informed me that my taxes had never been filed. I contacted the Liberty branch immediately and have spent the past year calling, texting, and going by the branch constantly. Each time I have been lied to and given the runaround being told "I just spoke with the IRS and it should all be taken care of in 6 weeks or so." I check back and get the same story all over again. My phone call in April was responded to with "I am too busy right now to look into your taxes." Two years have gone by since I paid for their services and a year since I have been aware that the job was never done and I still can't get them to finish this nightmare. My daughter lost her chance for financial help and I had to pay for her summer tuition out of my pocket and I cannot tell you the stress and anxiety this has caused. I've contacted their corporate office and virtually nothing has been done. I will NEVER do business with Liberty Tax in Brandon FL again and warn others to be careful.
When I filed my taxes Liberty was suppose to reimburse me 255.00$ which I still have not received. They charged me 759$ for taxes I filed which I had no deductions so there was no reason to charge me almost 800$ dollars which was half my refund. I'm so angry as the preparer did not tell me the price to file until after he had already done everything which I would have never filed with Liberty if he would have told me that. Total to file with no deductions. I want my money back. You owe me Liberty.
I went to a Liberty near me on January 31 to file. I was charged over $600! it took the lady over an hour to prepare my taxes. I received only $500. I spoke to the IRS and found out I was issued twice as much and never received it. ** you Liberty.
We had to do an amendment for our taxes which was received at the IRS on May 15 and we were to know in 3 wks about the money owed us. It is 4 wks now we have called the Liberty tax office which charged us $279 to do our taxes and they do not answer nor do they call us back. This is bull. Their office is located in Roaring Spring Pa. Their office no is 17157, preparer was **. We would like to know what do we do next.
I went to Liberty Tax on 02/11/15. The lady took over an hr to prepare my taxes. Never told me how much was the fee until the end when she wanted my signature. That fee was over $400 - seriously? They get more money than a person working their ass off. Today is 05/26/15 and I haven't get my refund back, but they were quick to take my state taxes and didn't even bother to let me know they got that money at the end of February. They took that money as a fee payment when I needed. They just stealing people's money. Try calling them is a rap they don't help. They will call IRS pretending to be you and then tell you some crap. I WILL NEVER USE LIBERTY TAX EVER!!!
I want to warn all immigrants new to Canada to be careful using with Liberty Tax as they ''don't know International tax'' (according to brown hair lady). Shame she didn't mention that on the first day, we would walk away. If you're asking too much question about Canadian tax system which is so different from your original country, YOU are in trouble! If English is your second language and ask the same question twice to understand and double check THEY DON'T LIKE IT. If they do mistake like in my situation (wrong DoB) They won't correct it, so I got papers from Tax office about wrong DoB. They got offensive. If you have questions about International taxes they are not able to answer them so you need to call tax office yourself anyway. Guy from tax office said that there are few mistakes so I told Liberty Tax about, I got nasty insulting and menacing phone call from owner calling me fraud, liar then apologized. I had a chance to meet previous owner, nice elderly guy who was very nice, patient to explain things. He told us to come any time and ask as much we want but the new owner is different story. Canada is made by immigrant and with this attitude he can start looking for another job (with brown long hair woman). They are highly UNPROFESSIONAL, UNHELPFUL and RUDE. You save yourself lots of trouble and stress to use different tax company. They may be good to fill tax for Canadian, but they're useless with International tax and not willing to help at all. I am very grateful for this experience as I learned to appreciate nice, helpful and professional people. I wish them all the best in a future, hope they learn how to treat customers... We paid $250 dollars to be insulted called liars and frauds... I never come across such a bad service. They can't deal professionally, taking everything personally and attacking you back.
Of the main tax preparer companies Liberty is by far the most expensive. I don't know what it is they think they are offering that justifies a price 50% higher than their competitors. The office was dirty, the carpet was filthy, and the overall environment was unpleasant. And they charge the highest price. They can't possibly survive doing that.
I used Liberty Tax in Bristol, TN this year. I received a late tax form and had to refile. I have some questions about my refile but they will not return my phone calls. I have been to the office on two occasions but neither time have they been open during their posted office hours. I have not filed the refile papers to the IRS as I am not sure they are correct. I am completely upset about how they treat customers. If I can ever find someone from this company I will ask them to refund the $820 I paid them to file my taxes and honor their customer satisfaction guarantee. This is some of the worst customer service I have ever experienced.
Used Liberty Tax service for a few years before switching to a local accountant. LTS was always $400+ every year. The accountant charged a little over a hundred dollars. It always took forever to get the refund when filed thru LTS. With the local accountant, it took a third of that time. I will never use LTS again. I recommend to everyone that you use a local accountant.
Went to liberty tax because I was not sure how to fill out form 8962 & did not want to make any mistakes - little did I know that the girl who was doing my taxes didn't either. It's been 11 weeks & still no check from irs - then they closed the office where my taxes were prepared & no way to get in touch. Called the 800 number but still no answer about my return. Worst experience ever.
The local offices, through advice of corporate, promise prizes and money bonuses to people bringing in customers. They close their offices and refuse to fulfill their end of the contract by refusing to honor their obligation to award prizes and money due their customers who recruit other customers. If necessary, we will file a small claims action to acquire what is contractually ours. Why are these people still in business bilking, misrepresenting and defrauding the unsuspecting public? Why hasn't the result of the class action suit been that the IRS has closed them down and fined them. These franchise owners are reprobates. STAY AWAY. Your taxes will never be done correctly and they will cheat you and rob you blind when it comes to the preparation fees and your refund.
Was interested in buying a franchise until we experienced the office on Curry Ford Rd in Orlando. Having preparers help in another business selling cell phones and repair service was just one of the many complaints against this office from the customer point of views and the many preparers exposed to mismanagement.
I used the Worcester, MA Liberty Tax office for a number of years and regret that I ever gave them my business. I filed my 2013 tax returns and somehow they mistakenly deposited my tax refund to someone else's account. When I reviewed the account, it was accurate. They even deducted the filing fee from my bank account, but deposited the money to another. The worse part of the situation is, the people at the office are of no help. The owner, Bill Rhines, did not once try to contact me or be of any assistance. Even the people at their headquarters are unresponsive. I had to do my own research and investigation. I've spoken to a couple tax lawyers and have filed a fraud claim with the IRS for this office's negligence. I would definitely not recommend this office OR ANY Liberty Tax offices. Horrible customer service, very unprofessional, and terrible job. I've learned my lesson, spend the money and get your taxes done by the professionals. These guys are amateurs.
I was told that Liberty taxes now file for self employment, and that we would get $50 in cash after filing. Once they filed they said I would be getting $46 in state and $831 in federal. After about a month, the lady named Mrs. ** told me I had to come back to the office and file an amendment. She said something about me going to a College... CCB, I never went to college in my life! I went on trusting her and let her file the amendment. The she gave me the package already sealed and said I had to mail it in. I'm thinking, this is kinda odd, because I had to do an amendment a few years ago at another tax place, and all I had to do was sign a paper and they mailed it in. A few weeks later, I received some mail from the IRS saying that I had to sign some papers along with 2 other people signatures to prove my Identity. I did that and mailed it back to the IRS. Now my sister said they did the same to her. She went to the Federal building and the told her it was Identity theft and Refund fraud. I'm going to them too to see what can be done about this. I'm so disappointed in Liberty tax. Now I owe IRS more than I expected to get.
My wife and I filed our taxes only to be hit with high preparation fees, in fact our state taxes were to be sent to our home 3 months later. We called looking for our state taxes and the state said our taxes was mailed out 2 months prior. Also the amount of our refund was direct deposited to Liberty tax. We never set up any direct deposit with liberty tax. They had the money sent to them instead of our home. That was deceptive we never set up any direct deposit. With them, we ask “where was our state taxes?” They said it went to preparation fees. They took more than what they said they were -- that is stealing. We are going to pursue this further. Never use them Ever. They take advantage of the Black community offering 50 dollars for referrals all the while jacking your money.
I filed my return on the 8th day of April, they told me I would get back 433.00 and I owed 102.00 to the state. I just got a phone call on Wednesday the 15th of april saying my check is there. They didn't WARN me they would be closed indefinitely! I couldn't go on wednesday so I tried Thursday and Friday. Closed. I called a 1 800 number and inquired about the location on east Tremont and Westchester square. They said they would open Saturday at 11 am. I waited till 1 pm, no one ever showed. I called the 1800 number again! They told me that it would be open on Monday april 20. Waited till 10 am, no one showed again. I called a location on Fordham road because a Liberty rep told me the primary office for my Liberty was at Fordham. So first time I called "they said that someone had called me in anticipation for my check" then I checked irs.gov and was told that my return was sent on april 15, 2015 to my bank account which is strange!! Because I never provided my bank account!! So I called again, this time the Liberty rep. ** said my check was in transit, to call later in the week. Probably so they can make their quick getaway. I will personally going there saturday April 25 to get to the bottom of this. And I will probably NEVER use liberty again!!!
So I went to do my taxes like everyone else would. The lady who is the manager of the North Hills Sherman Way Liberty Taxes, has called me, told me my taxes were going to be available for pick up on FRIDAY APRIL 17. Well I went and was there for 3 hours, all the other Liberty Taxes are opened.. Now it's Saturday April 18... Where is my money???
I was told by a colleague of mine that Liberty Tax Service only charged her $50 for her tax prep. I went in on tax day, knowing that I would probably have a higher fee since it was last minute. However, I was not prepared to be charged $520, which was HALF of my return! I called the customer service line and told them my concerns. I only had three forms (1040, 1098, 1098E). They said they would contact the owner of the franchise that I went to and I should hear back within 24 hours, and if I don't, then I should call back with my reference number. 48 hours and nothing from them. So, I called back and was told that they would alert corporate. SOMETHING better be done soon. Do they not get audited by the IRS?!
Had no deductions, therefore it was a simple form, but too expensive. Will not use this service again as had not ever had to pay more than $150. This first time I have used this service, it cost $451. I mentioned that I could send a personal check, or if I could pay electronically, I was told either way. So I agreed to electronic pay which cost another $32. Understand it was my choice, but I believe extra cost could have been mentioned. Also, originally told would get a refund, asked man to recheck which he did & sure enough had not entered an income - honest mistake. To sum it up, will look for another option next time - main reason too expensive therefore cannot recommend. Asked why cost was so much, no explanation given at office.
Went to get taxes done. No quote was given. I was told when taxes were complete the charge was $650.00. I was shocked. I have never paid this amount. I am single, retired senior citizen with some deductions. I was charged more than some of my friends who have their own businesses were charged by a CPA. Someone needs to investigate this company and get the unreasonable charges back to the people that were overcharged.
My 22 year old daughter went to Liberty. She did not need to itemize and was told that it would be under 100 dollars, as she only made 10,000 during the year. They completed the form and charged her $323 dollars. For a short form! She paid it thinking she had no alternative. They completely took advantage of her.
There is NO $61 tax prep as advertised. I made a whopping 1500 this year as a consultant. The IRS had a few bucks back my way. The deer in headlights prepper seemed like she was completely clueless and I wondered if she even worked there at one point. She said, "Ok, you owe... Oh my, I cannot charge you that!" She said, "Let me see what I can do... Ok, you owe $225" FOR A TAX RETURN FILE THAT TOOK NO LESS THAN 35 minutes of her time? ARE YOU KIDDING ME? How can these people sleep knowing they are bleeding those who can LEAST afford it out of their last dime! STAY AWAY FROM LIBERTY!
Okay so I am so glad I am not alone in all this. I have been dealing with lies and disrespect for over 7 months!! There is a class action lawsuit going on all over the country. Watch **.
I went jan 24 to file my taxes but I was never told I need to have a 8962 or 1095. I waited 21 days. I called the irs to find out from them I was missing information when I did get that information. Where I was getting a big amount that called out a much smaller refund amount. But the irs called out a larger amount. Every time I called they always call out different amounts. The man who did taxes say I told him I had insurance. He took my word, he should have told me I needed proof in writing. He just took my word. At first they said I was getting 1233 then $200 after the amended return then 7500. They keep my state taxes, I still waiting for my refund. If I don't get what I am supposed to, I will get a lawyer.
I am a young girl working part time. I had one W2 to file for this year so I figured it would cost between $50 to $80. The employee of Liberty Tax in Shrewsbury said that my refund would cost $270. Clearly this employee was trying to overcharge me and was trying to take advantage of my youth and friendly disposition. He then told me that I would receive an $80 discount. His sordid maneuverings were completely transparent and when I called separate Liberty Tax location to get another quote to see if the deception is company-wide, I received a "non-answer" and was told to come in for a consultation. I then called H&R block to see if it was unusual for these businesses to not give prices over the phone. The women at H&R Block told me that my tax refund would be about $90, which was in the realm of my previous assumption. I hope this review dissuades all readers from using the services of Liberty Tax because there seems to be a general consensus of deceit.
First they did my taxes all wrong, from $1,214.00 it went down to $867. Liberty has had my money since March 11, 2015. Never called to tell me the IRS let me know the money was sent to them. Also they are charging me $100 for doing my taxes. Now they don't want to give me what is left which is $80.
I went in March 7th, had ** do my taxes and he did them wrong costing me almost 400 bucks to do them and now someone else had to fix them and I have to wait another 6 to 8 weeks. I'm not very happy that I paid someone to do my taxes and they didn't do them right nor took the time. After 21 days of waiting to find out what's going on and all ** did was give me a number to call which I couldn't even speak to anyone at. I feel spending that kinda money my taxes should of been done correctly and I feel ** didn't make the effort to help me. I feel I should be reimbursed for my tax preparation cost. Thank you for your time. Please call me with any questions at **.
So I went to Liberty Tax Service here in Joplin Missouri and was told after I got my refund of 998.80 only to find out I got 932.00 so they kept my state well. I filed for a refund for the tax preparation fees. I was told I would get a full refund of 215.00 and so I wait for the check to find out it was 125.00 and I been fighting to get my money back. Bad company. I wouldn't recommend the pope to file with them. I hope someone gets them shut down.
I took time off the work to accommodate schedule of Liberty Tax. I had all my expenses itemized in details but I was told that mileage for the car expenses looks suspicious and almost unbelievable. Also I was questioned for other expenses I used for my job and told that I need to have receipts brought to Liberty Tax. What are these guys??? IRS agents??? I felt discriminated by these people and I am more cautious about them than IRS!! This was at location in Windsor Heights, Iowa.
I'm not a tax professional, but I know enough to correctly file basic tax returns. One of my employees used the Liberty Tax Service in Clinton, TN. She questioned her return, had me crunch a few numbers, and my results were quite different from Liberty's. When she brought me her return to review, I couldn't even duplicate their figures - I don't know where they came from. By my best guess, they used her husband's (they filed jointly) gross income as opposed to the AGI, but even those numbers didn't match. When she confronted them, they lied, backtracked, and they actually got to the point in which they told her "look, we're just trying to make a living, too." Seriously? They had to file an amended return (and then lied about when they filed it,) and now she's been contacted by the IRS requesting additional info. I'm going to take care of it for her, but her entire experience has been appalling. I did the returns for a few of my other employees (no charge - I mean, it takes 10 minutes,) and I'm going to do hers next year…provided the Liberty fiasco doesn't result in her being audited, in which I'll let my accountant mom take over. Bottom line: employees at these places ARE NOT tax professionals. They're not even college graduates. Anyone can get hired, they charge exorbitant fees, and they are incompetent. If you've had a positive experience, count your lucky stars…it'll only be a matter of time before you find yourself in the IRS hot seat.
** did my taxes for me and she was amazing. She was friendly and very helpful and explained everything to me step by step. Will return just for her services. My complaint would be on a lady I believe was named **, she was rude and very unfriendly. I had questions for her and she was just in a hurry to hang up the phone with me and was very unprofessional. She had a terrible attitude and it made me not want to file my taxes with the company again. I filed my taxes with the Panama City Beach location in Florida.
When I went into their local office, I asked what the cost was to process a 1040EZ and could not get a solid answer even after I explained that I had no deductions. I had heard some of the rates of other companies and told him to go ahead and do the paperwork. When he got to the end and told me the total, I was flabbergasted! They charge $217 for what I could have done for free online or paid $50 for at their competitor! Furthermore, the return itself was only $416 which is the smallest one I've gotten in the past 2 years. They will not be getting my business in the future... It takes a lot to make me upset enough to complain but this is an outrage!
They were evasive about charges when we first got there. Had a coupon that we received in mail and we're told we could use when they finished. That didn't happen. Charged three times the amount that we had paid for the same service before. Office was very dirty and we were there 4 times and it was always dirty.
Well to start off they can call me and try to recruit me to come file my taxes there, Good thing I had already done them myself, but she also informs me that since I filed last yr with them that I could refer a friend and get $50 cash on the spot. So today I look online at which places are open today and all the liberty taxes are open till 9, and when we drove up to the spots the OPEN signs were All on with the lights flashing, the whole spiel, but there was not a soul to be found.... That's bs if you ask me. So I finally found one with a person inside who said they could file it for my friend. Well we finally get there and this dude says I have to have the coupon, well I never got one of those cause the lady called me over the phone told me that since I filed last yr with all I had to do was come in and fill out the card. So either this man in front of me right now is ** or the lady on the phone did, either way I don't ever want to deal with these people again and if I get a call from a liberty tax consultant I'm going to let them know what I think about their ** service, shady promotions and recruiting techniques.
Do NOT EVER use the office on Camp Bowie in Fort Worth TX. I went there the year before and things were good, but this year my taxes have been so messed up and I have contacted their main office three times. The first I was called back but no calls since then to fix what they messed up. They have managed to even mess up my taxes regarding my school funding as well. DO NOT USE LIBERTY TAX SERVICE!
First, as a person who has worked for this company I can explain a couple of things. Fees are done by the number of forms. For example, a W2 is $15. If you bring in six of those you have $90 in charges. Add the federal and state base rates into that. If you have more than one state that increases it more. Fees cover not only prep but all overhead for the store. Rent, utilities, computers, software, franchise fees, etc have to be covered. Sometimes a client has the refunds taken to satisfy back debts to the IRS or the state. Liberty Tax Service has no control over that. Clients can choose to have their fees taken from their refund and that is where that charge comes from. All that being said, I know there might be some poor preparers out there. I've seen some of them. They have no business doing taxes. As for working there, there is no way I ever would again. It's high pressure and just not how I like to work. I love the clients and I like my co-workers. I hate the pressure and the nearly constant chewing out I get. I'm glad for having had the experience as it has taught me a lot.
I've used Turbo Tax for the past 10 years to file my federal and state taxes. While getting ready to do so for this year I came across DIY on-line tax service, a Liberty affiliate, which said it charged no fees to prepare and file taxes. After doing my taxes they reported my federal tax was $0, and my state tax refund was $601. I knew right away that that information was wrong. I went to Turbo Tax, inserted the same information and they reported $0 federal tax due, and a $1,200 state refund. It cost me $99 to file with Turbo Tax, but they missed $599 more to which I was entitled. I have no affiliation with Turbo Tax, or compensation from them, and I use their services based on ease of use, and accuracy of preparation.
We had credit card fraud and had to file by paper. We were at the office for only an hour. When we received the total price I nearly lost it!!! $350 dollars to get our taxes done! I am a licensed electrician and customers would tell me to leave if I gave them that price. I feel like we got ripped off!!
NEVER, NEVER, NEVER use Liberty Tax Service. I was unclear how to fill out my tax return, and went to the Liberty Tax office on South College in Wilmington. I had one W-2 to complete. I did not know how simple this return really would be to complete. They made it sound really complicated, said I needed a Schedule A, earned income credit sheet, Standard 1040 form to include standard deductions. It sound complicated. I had a total refund coming of $550, they charged me $415 to do the return and a bank fee of $39.95 to electronically file it. Out of my $550 refund I netted on $169. I quickly realized how simple the return really was. Preparation required about 10 minute of their time. They have a 100% satisfaction guarantee so I returned to complain and request my money back. They refused. NEVER, NEVER, NEVER use Liberty Tax Service. They make simple things sound complicated, confuse you deliberately, and do not honor their guarantee. Also, they are not a member of the Better Business Bureau for obvious reason; They are NOT COMMITTED to Better Business.
I went to liberty tax office 188 post Ave. Westbury, NY location and they ** up my tax paper purposely and got some money from my tax return to DIRECTLY THEIR CHECKING ACCOUNT without my knowledge!!! I jut got a letter from IRS and need to pay back $2500 plus interest. I went to this office 4 times and the manager never talk to me. After I got my letter I heard many people got same problem and letter from IRS. They lying about you and telling to IRS I went to school (NEVER) I am married (I AM SINGLE) and I have 2 kids (I DO NOT HAVE KIDS). This monday I will go again to talk with manager - if not I will call police to report them and I will sue them right away. STAY AWAY ALL LIBERTY TAX OFFICES. THEY ALL DO SAME THING!!!
I went to file my 2013 taxes and they put fraud on my taxes and I didn't even find out to this year because they never gave me my copy of my taxes. They also charged me 835 to prepare my taxes. Who the hell charges that much - Liberty tax does. I'm fighting with them to return that money to me because never once did they tell me how much they would charge me and two never gave me any such copies.
They file single for a married guy. Don't inform you the estimated cost of filing. Spend 2 hours for typing 1 form. Spell errors. Talkative but not productive. :( Can't give --ve 5. Please go out of business and don't waste people time. Yeah finally charge $300/-. IRS office is laughing at the form they filled in.
I had liberty tax service in Hiram GA file my taxes. After we sat and filled my taxes out and we signed them (my signature and ** the owner or part owner). They were ready to be sent in. After waiting 3 weeks I was notified that someone went back after they were signed and added something else that was not part of my return. This the IRS flagged and said it was not right and needed to be fixed. The original that I signed was correct but who ever went back and changed that return messed it up. So now my return had to be amended. Liberty tax in Hiram is now trying to make me pay for their mistake and charge me for them having to fix their screw up. Said I had to pay for all their service before they will resubmit my return. So now I have no money to pay their high tax service but I will not even be able to get what's owed from my return for their screw up. I believe that's fraud since they went back and changed the original after I signed it stating it was finished and correct the first time. This tax service is the worst I've ever seen and corrupt. They will cheat you and take your return and falsify your return and that will get you in trouble. Someone needs to be accountable for their mistake. Not the person using their crappy service.
I filed my taxes with them on Feb 2 and still until today Mar 24 I haven't received my refund. I went numerous time to them and all they tell me is that the IRS is still processing it. Come on processing what? I truly think that they messed up my forms.
I did my taxes with Liberty Tax on February 6th and I got told it would be 21 days. I'm still waiting for it. I believe I'm being scammed by them and I feel I have the right to sue them since they are taking their time and telling me lies about my return.
3/15/15 Liberty Tax Serv Santa Ana CA picked up state refund. Shocked only $45 was supposed to be $323.00 & fed $1,482. Ms. ** orig said $85 to do taxes. They already took it from refund. Asked her why she lied? She should have said over $200 would of gone somewhere else. Shame on you!
I who am a single mother of 2 little ones went into Liberty Tax in Wheat Ridge, Co and asked for an estimate for how much they would charge me to file a very basic return..... The lady said about $150. So I then preceded to have them filed and a different lady who prepared my taxes didn't talk to me other than the few questions she had. Very rude. Also I had my direct deposit for my bank info sitting on her desk and she said "well do you have $420 right now that you can pay your fees with"? I said no so she said she had to have a check printed in the store and didn't tell me that it costed an additional $40!! I have never been as disgusted with a tax place as I was Liberty Tax!! And it sounds like they are terrible all over the United States! Don't use Liberty Tax if you don't like being blind sided!!
My husband and I filed our taxes 1/30/15. We were told we would receive our refund in 21 days. On 2/23/15 I received a letter from iRs saying I did not file a 1095a form. I checked my packed and it showed it was included in my paper work. I called the irs to see if there was a problem with the form I had filed because I had read some went out incorrectly, I was told it was not received. I also checked with marketplace to see if I had received the correct info before have liberty refile it. When I called liberty the lady I spoke to told me it was a problem with their system that the 1095a was never filed and she will send it to irs asap. Later that day I got a call from the owner saying it was not their fault, it wasn't accepted because it was the wrong form. I explained I spoke to the market place and irs paper work I received was correct just never received. Mr ** refuses to accept responsibility in the mistake. I have left message for him with no return calls. I was told they sent paperwork. If it is wrong why would resend it?? I was charged almost $700..00 to file my taxes. If I was audited I feel this company would leave me high and dry since I can't even get a return call over something minor.
Went to the Compton ca office to do my taxes. They charge me $600.00 in fees and when I didn't get my return I call the irs and they said they added a w2 to my name -- that was not me. I had to do it all over. Don't sent nobody to liberty because it will come back on you. I will be reporting them to the irs 2015. There is a form you can get from the irs #14157 then fax it to 18558897957.
Please do not have your taxes prepared with these guys... They are not knowledgeable about the tax laws. Have been waiting now for my 2013 refund for over a year. They told me in January that it was on its way, now I found out they never even sent it in... Don't be fooled by these people. They really don't know what they are doing.
Ok so every year something goes wrong in my taxes cause liberty tax screws it up. This year they said I get back certain amount in state yet no state check. The amount I enter is wrong. I know I paid off Idaho state tax commission in 2010 from their first mess up. Now on top of that I call and always get a lady named Jaimie who is rude - call me an idiot and lied and hung up on me no more. How about a lawyer and yes I do have one. I asked to speak to her boss and get hung up on. I ask if she would look. She said she did. But another person asked in background "you did" in a question. I'm done. I'm complaining. I'm tired of being belittled by a company that's ripping people off.
Tax year 2013 Liberty did our taxes. The charge was $400.00 plus. We thought this was high but we did not agree on a price before getting them done. This year H&R Block advertised they would do it for 1/2 of last year's cost. A rep. called from Liberty Tax and ask if they could do our taxes this year. I told her about H&R Block. We agreed on the phone Liberty would charge $200.00 and I set an appt. It took 45 minutes but we needed another paper; going back the next night. They agreed on the $200.00 before starting anything. Taxes done and they told us the fee was $600.00 plus but half was $300.00 plus. We complained and reminded them about the agreed upon price but ended up paying $250.00. If your business is run this way, I wonder how secure my information is.
I did my tax refund in 1/23/15, is 2/27/15 and nothing yet. When I call IRS, I was told by IRS that Liberty Tax did the mistake by putting the wrong amount. Now I got to wait longer (I know my bills are not liberty’s problem) but I was relying with this money and now bills are coming out my ears. I think that if I get charge $200 and up for the services and a mistake is done, I should get the fee refund to me or customer back. Why pay so much for waiting?
On 2/04/2015 I went to Liberty Tax Service located at 8th Broadway, Louiseville, KY, only to learn they were going to charge $495 and I was only going to get $953.00. I told the preparer, "Who in their right mind would pay that amount to get less than $1000?" I was told they charge by the forms used. I am single, no dependents, and the only deductions were for interest I paid on a student loan. What did notice while waiting was how many young women came there to get their taxes done. And how much money Liberty Tax Service was making. When I raised serious questions as to why the fees were so high, I was told it was for the convenience of getting my money sooner, and was told that people who were getting thousands of dollars back didn't mind paying for that convenience. These office locate in urban areas where there low wage earners who qualify for high earned income credits. These type of companies are robbing these families of thousands of dollars that these families could use. I left the office and went to my local Urban League and got my taxes done for, and got my money within the same amount of time Liberty Tax Service would have gotten my refund. Also don't fall for the referral bonus trick. I had a $100 come-back referral only to be told it would take 3-4 days to get it if approved, but card stated the day I filed my taxes. THE BIGGEST RIP-OFF EVER!!!
The manager David ** shooting lies! The store in Columbus GA on Buena Vista Rd. He lied about what I was getting back on my federal return, numbers did add up. They didn't let nobody see the screen who were getting their taxes file! I know for a fact he was getting everybody who wanted to do e-file. If he did me like that he had to do everybody else the same way. Reason why I say that. I call Georgia IRS IN Atlanta. They told me they sent the federal tax 1280 to my account. Well I only receive 780. That manager put their bank route number under my name and made it look like it was mine. That's false information and that's fraud cause they is pocketing our money and they get loans from companies and hand out what they want you to get. I strongly argue you people to file a tax fraud affidavit form and fax to the IRS. THEY doing it to all store of people doing e-file and they overcharge, tax preparers fees is over 499.00.
My daughter visited a Liberty tax office and proceeded to file her 2014 tax return. To her and my bewilderment, she was overcharged for the filing process. I just simply want to discourage anyone from being took advantage of - she failed to ask what the fees were. This was her 2nd time filing a return so she really did not see this coming. Beware of their fees.
So I went to liberty tax to file as self employment, I only made $7500 during the year. They scammed the IRS and added another $3000 to make my refund go higher. SCAM! THEN had the nerve to charge me over $800 just to file with them. I am outraged as I didn't think it would be so much till he showed me the papers after I electronically signed my name to this crap. $832 is what I was charged on top of the US dept of EDU taking my entire return. So now I have nothing at all but a bunch of missing money and I’m pretty more poor. I would never in my life go to this place and I don’t think anyone else should, total scammer place, adding extra funds?.. I can’t believe this!
I used Liberty Tax Service for the first time this year, because a friend referred me to them, to file my taxes. I will never use them again or refer anyone else to them. At first I claimed my girlfriend's children as my dependents, because I have been helping take of them for a few years now, so she allowed me to claim them. LTS supposedly sent my return off, but a few days later I got a phone call from them telling me that the IRS had kicked my return back to them saying that I could not claim my girlfriend's children. LTS refiled my return after dropping my dependents, and they ended up getting more of my tax return than I did. I only got back $711 and they took $400 of that, so I only ended up with $311. How can they take more of my money than I get? How can they get away with this? They are rip off artist in my book.
I did my 2013 tax return with Liberty Tax in Houston and got audited this year. I was going to go somewhere else but my wife convinced me otherwise so I said ok I'll give another chance so we went in today and the tax preparer Amanda ** help me by taking a look at my last year taxes and by answering all my questions to the best of her knowledge and she even kept my 5 kids occupied while she was helping me with my taxes. I would recommend her to anyone I know. She did an amazing job. Thank you Amanda ** for a job well done.
My husband filed his taxes there and they said there is no hidden fees. When his return came they kept his state refund and said that was part of their charges to do his taxes after they charged him once already.
Very very upset with Liberty Tax! They charged us $269.00. They had it for one day and called us and said it was done. What do you charge two hundred dollars an hour. It is definitely a rip off. Was asked if my husband was a veteran because it's a discount for that. Well guess what, no discount. He is a veteran. Can promise won't go back. The fees are out of this world.
I filed at Liberty Tax in Glendale AZ on Indian School Road and they robbed me. The person at the desk had no clue what he was doing and actually fell asleep at the desk while doing my taxes! WTF bruh!! Out of all the taxes that got taken out this year they only gave me 450$ back and gave me a prep fee of 280$... I am never using Liberty Tax again!
I called Liberty Tax Service to see how much they charged to prepare a return. They said 150.00-250.00 depending on the return. We went the next day to do our taxes. They refused to provide us with copies of our return and refused to tell us how much they charged. We called back SEVERAL times to get the information. Finally he said that we were charged 500.00 for the return! Well yesterday we were finally able to pick up our copies and they charged over 700.00 for the return!!! I am OUTRAGED!!! I filed a complaint with the BBB and also filed a formal complaint with the IRS under form 14157. I will also be contacting a small claims lawyer and I also filed a complaint with the corporate office. This should be ILLEGAL!
Liberty Tax Services, located @ 1912 SOUTH CANNON BLVD, KANNAPOLIS NC 28083 not only VIOLATED my rights by giving some of my Tax information, lied about the date they submitted my Tax return, they FORGED my signature and initials to another Tax return they prepared after the original Tax return they prepared while I was present. I have contacted Liberty Tax Services corporate office 1-800-790-3863 IRS Advocate Assistance 1-877-275-8271. Sincerely, VIOLATED TAX PAYER :(
Went into liberty taxes in Anderson California and the lady I worked with was very unprofessional. First her boyfriend, I'm guessing, came in twice to interrupt the process that was already taking a while to give her items. He was covered in White Pride tattoos and racist tattoos all over his body. Second I had to Prove that my son who has lived with me for his entire life (I'm a single mom) had lived with me the year prior. He is six and doesn't receive any mail. I brought in doctor records and still didn't work. Left to try to find something with his and my name on it and couldn't calls back to there and they didn't have a response to why he had to have that. Went back to get my paper work and the lady took a copy of my social security card and driver license and kept a copy of them and refused to give me back the paper! Worse experience EVER. I should have never went back because the prior year In Portland Oregon I had a horrible experience as well. They wrote on my first check and my bank wouldn't except it and the. Requested not to write on the second one because it's hard for anybody to cash it and they did it anyways. The guy stated that that's their ID for the check cashing place next door and they get credit for referring a person over there. The check cashing place took $100.00 out of your taxes for cashing over there. Then the guy was so rude when tried to talk to him and was very condescending. Never go to Liberty.
On 1-21-2015 I had filled my taxes at 1126 W Wilson. A agent name ** also filled under another name ** is doing fraudulent there. She or this person had took 1000 actual out my account. I tried to get in contact with her she no longer work there!!! So I call the IRS......
967 Hempstead Turnpike Franklin Square - On Tuesday evening I came to this place as a walk in, in order to adjust my taxes that were already filed a week and a half before. I had the request to change my status from single to head of household. When I arrived at this location I had an interaction with ** , who was cordial at first but then quickly changed. She and her receptionist told me to fill out a form asking for my basic information such as name, address, etc. and she told me where to sign. After doing this, she then told me that she had to get something to eat to go on her break so she is prepared for us when she comes back so she is not sluggish and making mistakes. Okay no problem, she says this will just take from 15 to 30 minutes and she will be back. After about an hour she was not back and I went back home. When I returned home I called the assistant and requested an appointment for 12 noon. When I arrived Wednesday at that time, only myself and two other people were waiting. She was speaking to numerous people on the phone and I was not called until 12:20 (again I was only one of three people). She called me and went through my files from yesterday and pretended like what happened yesterday with her being very late never happened and didn't acknowledge it or apologize. What she did talk about was how I came on a crazy day and how busy Wednesdays are and she is moving about constantly. Stated she is glad how this is once a year only she has to deal with this. She told me days like Tuesday and Thursday are great days and when I reminded her I came on a Tuesday the day before and how I waited a while for her, no word of apology came out her mouth, she simply just said I was a walk in and appointments are best. She then worked on [my] the figures for my re-adjustment and wrote a piece of paper what my figures would be for federal and state and then gave me her business card. I had told her previously my return arrives Thursday morning (the next day) to my bank and she told me after the refund arrives she can only just take my word for it and to call her the next day and then come in with proof that the person I am claiming is my dependent and then I should pay then. When I called the assistant's number I am told by her that "** is not in the office" and asks me if I want to make an appointment for Monday. I say “no thanks” and realizing I don’t want to deal with this experience anymore. So I decide to go in and ask for my Form 1040 Individual Income Tax Return. When I walk in without even greeting me she is halfway standing up on the phone and screams out "Do you have an appointment?" "I am on a conference call, come back tomorrow”. I tell the receptionist who is looking caught off guard by how she is acting and tell her all I came for is my form 1040 document and nothing else. While ** is on the phone, the receptionist goes under the desk and is taking out of the folder and ** snatches it from her and says “in order to get my form back I have to be taken out of the system first” and she isn't gonna give me back my documents. I tell her she is not allowed to do that and all I asked for is to get my stuff and that is it and she tells me she is gonna call the police now. I tell her how nasty she has been acting this entire time and she tells me "You’re the one who took a couple weeks to realize you had a child you had to claim". Bringing up something that is not her business. ** then told me that I came in when the place was closed. When I walked in it was 8:30 and she said “well, the lights were off, we are closed” and I told her the business is supposed to close at 9 pm, not when she feels like it. When I am not leaving yet she tells her assistant to walk over since she is on the phone and call the police and tell them to come. I tell her “it’s okay, you can tell them to come, I’m still waiting for my documents” and ** says the police won’t get involved in an issue of “claim” and will only tell me to leave and believe her because "I am a tax professional". When I say to her “it’s all about you huh?” She says “yes right now it is.” Yes, ** was doing all of this while on the phone with someone in her "conference call”. Or more like she is talking to friends or her boyfriend while pretending it’s business. As I was leaving she screamed out to me I'm never getting my form back and pointed to the assistant telling her to close the door. When I came up to the place I just rushed and did not bring my phone with me so I could not report this myself to the police automatically. I have already reported her for employee misconduct and holding on to documents that do not belong to her without approval towards the IRS. If you ask around, I can promise you I am not the only person who has had a bad experience with Ms. ** at this place. Her cell phone number is ** .
I went to Liberty Tax in Winter Haven FL. The lady did my taxes. It took 15 mins then all said and done. I'll get back 1159. I said, "That's not right" then said "Sorry it's 1618." Got my refund it's 1159.05. I called 5 times - they didn't return my call. I went up there. They said they charged me 458.95 to do my taxes.
I and several of my friends and family members need assistance with payment discrepancies with the office that prepared our tax returns. The fees are not disclosed until we signed the contract and they are very high. Ranging between $400 to $900 for simple returns. My niece for example was charged about $450 to prepare her tax return reflecting a return of about $4300. When she went to get her check they gave her a check for $3000 and told her that the additional payment was for a loan she received. She NEVER got a loan. Then the manager "Cindy" told her it was for additional work required to put her return thru but it had already been filed. She then informed her that there was nothing my niece could do but cash the check as the IRS would not accept an amended tax return from another company and Liberty was done with it. They offered no explanation as to why Liberty took more money after they had already charged and filed her return. The money was taken from her return in addition to the agreed upon charge and with no explanation. In my case my return was rejected. Again the manager "Cindy" said it was because I did not give them the correct social security numbers. I gave them our social security cards! Then she said I needed to fill out a form for the denied EIC. I came into the office and signed the form. Two days later I called for a status update and "Cindy" informed me that it had been rejected because of the denied EIC again. The fact is that when they had me come into the office to sign the form they NEVER sent it. They misspelled my son's name, input the wrong information and failed to resend my return. I went to the office and asked for my W2's and told her that I did not want them to resend my return and that I was going to H&R Block as I always had. H&R Block did not return and found an additional $2200 over what Liberty did. But "Cindy" still resent my return and cost me the additional money on my return. I asked her office why after I clearly stated that I did not feel confident in Liberty any longer since they mishandled my return and lied about it. I was told that it was because I authorized it in writing and she was going to get paid whether I did or not. Where do I file a complaint in addition to my complaint with the IRS and the state Attorney General's office?
This happened to my daughter and her husband. Liberty $600.00 filing; H&R $100.00 refilling fee; $1000.00 mistake on Liberty Tax. They did return $200.00 of their fees, but still gets to keep $400.00 for nothing (so not right). Might think about seeing a lawyer over this matter, because believe me if we made that big of a mistake, they would be on you like a duck on a June bug. The kids are getting back from H&R $900.00 refunds.
My husband filed his 2015 tax return on 2/8/15. On 2/10/15 he applied for a loan and was approved. He was told to go to Liberty Tax within next four hours. When we arrived they had no idea what we were talking about or that they offer a loan. They have been rude. We've been waiting over 8 hours with no help whatsoever telling us 15 min that they're not going to bug the corporate office about how much longer will it be. Very very rude. The entire staff was rude and mind you they charged 500 to file my return. Do not recommend.
I felt scammed when I had my tax return done. I was not told there was a fee per form. Originally, my simple tax forms added up to be over $600. I was shocked. I should have been warned on how many forms & cost per form. He proceeded to "call his boss" to see if he could get me a discount. I was allowed the discount which made me break even w/ my refund & what I had to pay them. I was hoping to save money by not re using my accountant this year. Joke was on me. I paid my accountant $150 to do my 2013 taxes containing same forms. I paid $389 to Liberty Tax Service. I am very upset.
We went to them because we needed to get an advance on our tax refund right away. We were charged $39.95 by the bank they deal with and $355.00 to file taxes with them. We did get the $50.00 so really the charge was $305.00. Well needless to say we were denied the $550.00 advance, Why? Who knows and they keep the fee charged for nothing. We were duped into thinking we would get the refund in advance. So now waiting for the refund to be deposited into their bank and we get a paper check for the remainder amount. NEVER EVER GO THERE!!
Went there and received a quote for $100-150.00. Was there over 3 hours and they charged me $700.00. Was very surprised it was that much. I don't recommend this company at all.
First and foremost, we were charged 415.00 for a regular, electronic return of which, the only explanation we received was "well, you had 9 w2s and we charge for everything that had to be input into the system." I asked for further explanation and was only told they didn't Have any explanation of fees other than that! We did receive the $50 for filing with them that day (which, in my opinion, is a scheme to get you in the door, then hit you with the outrageous fees!). As if we are not poor enough! Secondly, we referred a friend, of which we were to receive $50 bonus for doing so. We were to receive that a week later. Our friend started her taxes, but did not have all of her W2s, so decided to come back the next evening, after she received them in the mail. The Manager, who started her taxes on the first day, had offered her a deep discount, in order for her to receive some kind of refund, but she declined. She filed her taxes the following day (I was with her), with a different individual. This individual did not know how to delete the discount, so he tried to get in touch with the Manager, who originally started the return, to no avail. He decided to file the taxes "as is", gave my friend her $50 filing bonus and told me that our $50 bonus should come in by the following Friday. He also told me "not to be mad at him if it did not go through!" Since that time, I have followed up several times to see where our bonus is, with no answer and that they would "check into it and get back with me". Only today, I called again, only to find (per the Manager who originally started my friend's taxes) that we would NOT be getting a bonus because they didn't make any money off it, due to the deep discount! I explained the Manager that this is NOT our fault because we acted on good faith and they should eat the charge because it was Their mistake!! She told me that Corporate would not allow it. When asked for Corporate's number, she just apologized and gave me the "customer service" bs that I know only TOO well from my many years as a Customer Service Rep! I informed her, I was contacting the IRS about this and hung up! I am LIVID!!!
This was the first time I have used Liberty Tax and it will be the last. At no point did they tell me there was going to be a fee let alone it was going to be a $350 fee plus a $40 handling and on top of that they spelled my son's name wrong... it was a simple form not a long form. They took almost $400 away from my son. I'm a single dad there's no reason for them to take that much. It is unacceptable.
So I decided to take a 10 weeks course at Liberty Tax in South Scranton, Pennsylvania and that office has the most unprofessional staff ever. The instructor Amy is super awkward and rude. She does not like to be bothered at all and does not train anyone correctly. The owner named Joe is very rude and does not like to be bothered either. These people throw you on the computer to start working there and then when you have questions or need help with a tax return they look at you as if you're stupid for not knowing the answer. Like hello this is something totally new!! You cant expect the employees to know everything and not make an effort to teach them correctly. There is so much gossip in that office that it gets in the way of the professional work. Amy the manager is so shady and a huge gossiper she has a problem with everyone in that office. Don't go there for courses people please!! Unless you want to work with miserable unprofessional people..
My refund was 640. Their service charge was 447. That's too much. Over half.
So I filed my taxes with the they was very nice. I filed on 1/20/15 accept on 1/21/15 but I can't go on where my refund. To see where my refund, called them they tell me "I can't help u everyone else has their money and I can't find mine, thanks." I call them over and over cause that's what the IRS said, so I DID but they are not giving me any answers so I don't know where my money is. All I know its been accept by the IRS, don't know when its going to DD or anything. I will never filled with Liberty ever again. All I want to know is where my refund and I can't get that if something messed up or what. I can't get any answer.
I use to work at Liberty Tax Service on 2312 East Monument Street in Baltimore, Maryland 21205. I was hired as a marketing employee. First they want you to come in at 8 a.m and you get pay at 9.am. Your pay is never right and Mr. ** who is the marketing supervisor don't know what he is doing, they have no break room. They hired anybody. You get hired and fired at the same time and sometimes you sat there not knowing what is going on until Mr. ** tell you, "Oh we not clocking in" which is on a piece of paper or maybe get on the computer and put your time in it is confusing. Someone need make a phone call on this place. It is not a good place to work. Half of the time you don't get paid. These store are Miss ** she is the managers of 6 Liberty Tax Service, also when you come get your check which is at 3 o'clock sometimes it is not there. You are paid with a check or cash it is crazy and at times you still have to wait for your check like 2 or 3 hours before ** bring them.
I had my mom report for me because I have anxiety really bad so they called me when it was ready for me just to sign. Then they said it's going to be $500.00! I said "Mam thank you for your time but I kindly apologize. I'm going to need that extra change you're trying to take from my kids and I." So we get up, "Thanks again" I say. We walk out, dude's like "Hey why you leave? I'm the boss here. I'll give you a big break." I'm like, "no thanks it's okay," and by this time my face is red cuz he asked me like five times and says, "Come on how much you wanna pay? $100? $150.00?" So I'm like OK OK and he lies and ends up charging me $175, better that $500.00 but wow they sure came down from $500-$175 huh. Seems like a scam. They should be more reasonable. My taxes were the simple e-z form.
On Jan 26th, 2015, I went to Liberty Tax in Mt Pocono PA. The tax preparer, Nicole, was very helpful and pleasant. She made sense of all my documents and made sure everything added up. She checked and double checked. I received the $50 on the spot and completed the tax preparation using JTH Financial services. On Feb. 4 I received my tax refund in my bank account.
Went to liberty tax by gcc in glendale corner of 59th. They charge too much. If you have a big refund they take up to 700$ but they are pretty fast about paying you. Took a week. And I needed the money so I went ahead like a dummy and ran with it, if you’re desperate you make stupid choices. This year I got ripped off. My tax return was 8500, they took 700. Never ever I will go back.
Do not do your taxes here!!!!! They tell you a number so you could do the taxes with them and pay them $800 dollars and then you get a different amount!!! When you ask why they don't give you a straight answer all they care is to get $800 out of you... Worst taxes company I ever did my taxes with. They only nice to you till they get paid. If I could give 0 or negative stars I will!!
I was not given the proper information about the fees for having my taxes filed. I wasn’t really given or any other chance. I also have found out I could have had them filed a lot cheaper and gotten more back with the option of how they will be received. Not forced into an option!
You go to these place for peace of mind and far too often you get screwed. I had owed from 2011 (Liberty Tax doing). Come to find out my 7000 return for 2014 had been altered to 1900 from the its and then they have the nerve to charge me full price of 545 for ruling when them. So use caution. It cost me 4800 dollars. Won't happen again. I strongly urge to look elsewhere.
I'm really sad, I filed my tax return, I asked them how much will be fee but they told after I completed everything they can tell how much. They took all my signature and handed over my file without saying my fee. I saw they charged me $540. This is not fair. They aren't transparent.
They have no explanation as to how they determined their fees and I was never asked about my medical expenses or anything else I paid last year. I paid over $400 on. My other family members went. They both made more than me and got charged way less.
Went to the 170 street Bronx office to file my taxes. This office by far is the worse!!! Staff is ghetto as ghetto can be!!! I received more last year with the same dependents. Mind you I received less of a return this year but was charged a 600 dollar fee. Unreal - I'm never go to liberty again. I wish I would have walked out the door. I would have 600 more dollars to feed my children!!! So angry.
I went to file my simple tax return tonight. I am single. I married, filing head of household with one dependent. I don't own anything. Nothing spectacular about my paperwork. The only thing they needed from me was my W2 from ONE job, my social and my child's social, my id, address, phone number, and my child's daycare information. Nothing hard. Nothing special. Took literally half an hour to file my taxes. Nobody informed me of any costs associated with doing my taxes. I was never told how much it was going to cost before they did them, or after I signed everything to go through. I found out once I got home and looked at the final paperwork they issued me. Also for the first time ever filing taxes, I didn't get any money back for the state return. Doesn't sound right to me. I make almost the same every year with maybe a grand here or there difference from year to year. I got home and seen how much they charged me. $540. $540. $540. For HALF AN HOUR of their time!?!! Are you kidding me? This should be illegal. It costs $40 to do it yourself online. But I was between paychecks and they lured me in with the promise of $50 in cash when you file so I figured, hey why not. I assumed it would cost me around $200-$250. Not $540 for a simple tax return. That's insane. That's robbery. I will never go back again. I will never refer anyone to go to them. That is insane to charge people that kind of money for something so simple. I would hate to see what it costs someone who's married with multiple W2s and multiple children, who owns a home, have stocks, and all that other stuff. They are robbing people everyday.
I filed with Liberty Tax Feb. 2014 Covington Ga. I thought amount charges not lesser than 300, what I thought. When I went there she told me as self-employed, nail tech had everything ready, she only had to enter into computer my info. I got concerns when she try to ask me she could lower my taxes if I add more expenses, I did not! I don't know if is their ways to tell people they can trick the system, very inappropriate. In any moment, I was told the fee and several times I request after continuing further. Her excuse: Corporate fixes the prices. I was charged 725, I complaint. I was calling IRS when the manager said he would drop 200 off, so much for corporate fee! Scam.
I took my taxes to Liberty to have them done. They told my that I would be not have to pay a health penalty if I came to them. Well I had to pay it, lie #1. So my wife did turbo tax to check if it was right. It was not, lie#2. So we showed them the mistake and we were told that they would refund all are money and file a amendment, lie #3. We had to give them back the 50.00 for filing with them and they would stop the taxes from getting done. I will never have anything to do with this place again.
I signed up to take Liberty Tax courses and noticed that the company was very unprofessional. Turns out there is a whole scandal behind it. First off the instructor was very rude and overly critical of students work and were unwilling to answer many questions. She would say things like "I'm charging you twenty dollars if you ask me another question" and things like "I like to eat bonuses". Here is the scandal part. Some of the branches are set up in drug infested neighborhoods (for lack of better terms), East Monument Street and Falls Road in Baltimore, MD. A customer comes in and the tax preparer actually helps the client to scam the IRS. NEVER EVER Work there! You will be audited, as she said herself she is audited every year.
Worst experience ever! Did my taxes there for this year. Offer the $50.00 for doing it. Then they want to charge me almost $700 for preparing my taxes. I found somewhere else that's cheaper. Now they don't want to give me my info. I have to pay the $50 first. Threaten to send my taxes in if I didn't pay. Then they want to be rude with their customers. One came in while I was there and she walked outside. Manager calls her a crack head. Wow really? So yeah I will NEVER go there again!
In 2013, Liberty Tax did my return. It was simple - it took her 5 minutes. Charged me $290.00, talked me into the direct deposit debit card they have. Didn't tell me every purchase you make with the card, they charge $1.00 and you can't draw all your funds out. If you do, they will charge a large amount. They are dishonest.
I signed up for a class with Liberty prior to tax season even though I knew the pay was extremely low. I thought it would be something fun to do during tax time - I'd had previous tax experience and just wanted a refresher course. On the first day of class I overheard the instructor tell members of the class various misleading information. On the third day of the class more incorrect information was being given out. On that same day after I was reprimanded (for nothing wrong) at the board while doing a class problem. I was told that I was "not a good fit" for the program, but if I ever wanted Liberty to do my taxes they would be happy to do so. I asked the instructor what my "attitude" problem was and she couldn't seem to provide an answer. Forget Liberty - they have an attitude problem!
They did my taxes last year 2013 and lied about my refund and charge me a lot to do them. Wasn't very nice.
I have been going to a tax person for over 10 yrs then she fell ill and retired, so I then looked for a new tax service. I read a flyer about this service, they were close to home so I went to see them. They were friendly at the time I did my taxes, also very expensive so I paid the fee. Then the next year I did my taxes myself with another service to save money. 6 months later I get mail from the IRS stating I did not report an income. This by now is 2 yrs later, so I went back to Liberty and asked them to look and find their mistake. I called about 3 weeks later and they had no idea what I was talking about. So I went to the office to ask questions. They had not done anything about my problem. I contacted them several times during this period, nothing. By this time 6 weeks later, they still had no idea! I was so frustrated I asked for a refund of the services. They told me they only do a percentage of what they will refund also not a full refund and then they could not help. They did not fill out entire return or info about income. They had all w-2 attached to the returns but no info on the returns. They did fill out the section on income, so now I am dealing with having to do that years' returns over because of their mistakes. They were not willing to do anything to help to try to resolve the issue nor take responsibility. After they requested my refund, they told me I am on my own! So now I'm owing the IRS and they are saying I am not reporting income. I have never had any problems with the IRS or any other tax service before, but the first time I tried them this is what happened.
Liberty Tax is a franchise. Many of the offices are only part-time during tax season, Jan. 15 - April 15. When you filed your return, the IRS has a copy of the information of course. First off, you should've kept a copy of the return, which is like a receipt from the store, a very important receipt, which by law (the tax laws) you're required to keep for 7 years. Now, if you lost your very important receipt, you have to rely on a copy kept by the IRS and Liberty Tax Service. First thing to do is contact IRS and find out what info they have (Google "IRS" to get their taxpayer services number). Then contact Liberty Tax if you can, to compare what they have vs. what IRS has. But if you CAN find your copy (your receipt) just compare it to what IRS has. If IRS made a mistake, explain it to the IRS agent, they will put a note in your file. Then take the correct info to Liberty Tax OR ANOTHER TAX PREPARER, along with your copy (your receipt) and they will fix it with IRS. No matter what, Don't be afraid to contact IRS taxpayer service and tell them someone made a mistake and you're trying to fix it. They will probably even give you more time (an extension) to fix the mistake. The worst mistake you can make is to just throw away the IRS letters that the IRS computer sent to you, since the IRS computers never forget, and eventually their computer will send you a letter about paying up in 30 days or (“we may seize your bank account”). Don't think you can just change banks and they won't find you. No bank lets you open an account without submitting your SSN (which the IRS has) and so then the only way to keep your money safe from seizure is to hide it under the mattress, in which case then you have to worry about being robbed.
I filed my tax return at the Centre Mall branch. A year later I get a letter from the CRA asking for my T4's so I call Liberty Main Office because it's off season Centre Mall branch is closed. They had the manager from the Centre branch contact me. I told her what CRA wanted. She called me back and said she talk to the CRA and faxed my T4's and all was ok . A year later I get a bill from the CRA for $6,500.00. I went to the Centre Mall branch and asked for help, left my name and number for the manager never got a call back. After some time I got someone from the CRA to help, he told me NO T4's were ever received and NO record of Liberty ever responding to the CRA requests. So I find out the $6,500.00 is because CRA with no T4's, denied me my tax deductions plus penalties [a year went past since liberty told me all was ok]. So this fall I go to the main office in Hamilton on King St, to look for help, they say they will look into it. A week later I call they tell me I must be mistaken, they have no record of me doing my taxes that year. I tell them that's funny I have my tax return summary for that year and the one before and after. I took it down to show them and they photocopied it. The problem I have is the T4's I have do not match the income they [Liberty] reported on my tax return and I find out from the manager from the King St, main office is they lost my file. It's been over 4 months now. I'm a patient person but it looks like you [liberty tax service] cost me $6,500.00. Help me get it back or make it right. WHAT DID I PAY FOR?
Liberty Tax Service forgot to input my W2 form in their system and IRS now send me a letter that I owe them money. I went down to Liberty Tax Service but to a different office. She stated that the woman did not put it in the system and I had to file an amendment tax return to fix their mistakes to correct it. I will get a lawyer and I had to pay for the amendment tax return. I will not go back there.
Liberty did my 2011 taxes and completely did them wrong. I lived in Indiana, but worked in Illinois. While speaking to the IRS, they told me that my W-2 forms were never sent in and Liberty only did my taxes for Illinois. I have contacted the corporate office with no success. They made a ticket, and said that the store manager would contact me in 2 days. Never received a call from anyone. Furthermore, when calling the corporate office back, you can only speak to a rep or the receptionist. They cannot let you speak directly with a manager. They are only open 1 day a week. But, the manager never showed. This is crazy. What happened to the professionalism and assurances if the IRS has issues with the tax returns they prepared. May have to get a lawyer involved. Beware with using them.
I work for liberty tax for 3 years and this year they didn't pay. I called corporate and they said to go to labor commission, that it was between the owner of the franchise and me. But the owner said corporate was to pay us since they took the store.
I filed with Liberty Tax in February 2014, then received my student taxes after filing so I had to file a separate return after receiving my refund went to do so and the office was closed when I tried to get my tax information so I looked on the internet to see office hours. It's now going into august and still nothing. I left voice mails, no return call from them period and the voice mails were left on the days they suppose to be opening. Getting extremely frustrated with Liberty and will not return to them as a customer.
The branch office that we went to made a "technical error/system error" that resulted in us having to pay back some of the refund we received. Somehow, when they entered in my early withdrawal amount from my ESOP account, their computer system entered it as "rollover" and didn't show on the 1040 as an income. The tax preparer went over the file and stated that everything was initially entered correctly but the system did not register it and somehow considered it rollover. He only briefly stated this to us without much clarification of how this could have happened. What I'm most upset about is the fact that this was a BIG oversight on their end. As they claim, the tax forms must be properly reviewed before submittal to IRS. In our case, it went through two reviews and the error was still missed. Of course, by us signing the tax form, we are agreeing with the information. But, this leaves no room for protection for the client. We really have no knowledge of taxes and governments forms. That is why we seek their services and yet we are left having to pay all the penalties when they make mistakes. It's incredibly unfair. With a company this big and successful, you would think they would own up to their mistakes and take responsibility. My husband and I wanted to seek legal actions to have Liberty Tax pay the amount we owe but, we decided against it. We will not use Liberty Tax or big tax service companies in the future and will do our own taxes.
2012 preparer failed to enter husband’s income. Now they refuse to follow up with the IRS as promised by the guarantee. Liberty Tax Corporate has not responded either. 2011 we received a large refund when we were only suppose to receive half the amount and again Liberty Tax had failed to help us or tell us why it was so large.
Liberty Tax Hackettstown, NJ - Our CPA passed away during tax season so I was left to find a place to do our taxes with little time. I saw Liberty Tax and pulled in. I was met by the owner Bernice, who I gave all our information to and told her what I paid for the service, $250. I asked her what her fees were and she said $250-$350. I said ok, let me know. Well when she called to say they were done and to come in to sign, she hit us with a fee of $700. She had a nice long list of forms used and cost associated with each form. I was speechless..for a second... then I said that is not right you we agreed to $250-$350. I said if it was going to be over double then she should have called and told me not assumed it was ok. It wasn't. Then hit me with a ridiculous fee. She agreed and said "I will drop it to $500." Like she was doing us a favor. I was beyond angry but my husband paid it so we could get out of there and let it be a lesson learned. Now today I check my credit card statement and she billed us 3 times for the service....$1,500!!!! Yes, we are disputing the two duplicate charges but it is just more of the same from this horrible business. STAY AWAY!!!
THIS IS BY FAR THE WORST TAX SERVICE I HAVE EVER HAD THE DISPLEASURE OF WASTING MY HARD-EARNED MONEY ON! The so-called "experienced manager" that did my return got me a refund significantly less than previous years. I went to H&R Block in Redlands for a free 2nd look and they got me an extra $2000! I told Liberty Tax I wanted them to honor their "money back guarantee" and refund my $300 fee. They refused by stating that I should have known what I can deduct and provided all documents (which I brought with me but that the "tax professional" never asked for or mentioned). This is idiotic! If I knew all the tax laws and deductions, why would I waste my money paying someone else to do my taxes? This was the same response that Liberty Tax's corporate office gave me. A "regional manager" called my wife and I liars when we said there was a poster on the wall of the office stating their money back policy if they made a mistake. Be warned, they will not honor their "guarantee" and they do not hold their franchisees accountable! They have the worst customer service of any company I have ever dealt with, and I have had some bad experiences with US corporations. Please do yourself a favor and go to a reputable tax professional! Liberty Tax Service does not value its customers!
I'm filling this out for my father. He filed his taxes. The girl convinced him to do direct deposits. She told him the money would be in his checking account in 2 weeks, so he was getting mad at me for not writing checks on that money till I was sure it was there. I made him go to the bank. It's been past a month now and the money is still not there. The office is closed and the phone is disconnected. I just checked online at the IRS. It's still being processed. My being upset is she told him two weeks and when you try and call Liberty Tax, the office is gone and so is the phone. She charged him 110.00 dollars to do his taxes and tell him, "Do direct deposit. It will be there in two weeks" which has been over a month and half. Then you can't even go or call the office. I'm gonna save him money. I'll do his taxes for free.
I was looking into our checking account and somehow Liberty Tax services got our checking acct number, Routing number and wrote a check for 177.00 even on April 15th, the deadline and actually had the nerve to sign their name to the bottom. Leroy **. Well, guess what Leroy, Our Bank got the copy and someone is going to get into trouble. We had our taxes taken care of by an independent Tax Person and this is not how you do business. We have to go to the bank tomorrow and change our bank acct number that we have had forever, thank to these thugs. How they got this information is beyond me, there is no reason for this. You should have to had ID or a name to go along with this check. And Leroy, we will press any and all charges possible.
I had filed my income tax March 4th 2014. I already received my federal and wait 1 month and some change for my state due to adjustments. My dd was April 21st. It's been 5 days already and the bank already received a deposit. I call everyday to see what's the status and they always state that it'll be here tomorrow.. tomorrow.. tomorrow. I was also told that they haven't checked the box to my old site cause tax season is closed, so I have to go to the all-year round liberty. They said I should have it today and now no one's picking up the phone. I'm single mother now who just lost her job so it's tough. Pls help.
My boyfriend is active duty military. He was deployed for 9 months in 2013. He used Turbo Tax for the first time and because he entered his AGI wrong, the system wouldn't allow him to file. Turbo Tax is free for military personnel. As a single person without any thing to claim, he used the 1040ez form. Liberty Tax charged him over $300. That is absolutely 100% unacceptable, I didn't find out until it was too late or I would have told him to forget it. This place is a rip off!
I submitted my documents (including tuition) to the person processing my taxes beginning of March (I wasn't in state so this is over email). The first time he came back to me, I was informed I would owe $1,500 (I'm a single mother of two and a full time student looking for work so this didn't add up to me). I went through my records and found some medical bills that were not accounted for and submitted those to him asking if that changed anything. He said it did and I owed $900. I asked how is that possible if I had been a full time student... he said he wasn't aware of that (my tuition and supporting documents were in the initial email). Eventually he said I would get $700 back, they would charge me $200. At this point I decided to take my stuff to H&R Block who has done a thorough job in the past. H&R Block asked for the return submitted by Liberty Tax... They sent me a link that was only "good" for one use it seems (I tried to gain access again but it said it wasn't valid). I pulled up the document and it said I owed $900 (not what the employee told me in our final discussion). I checked my bank statement and I had a deposit from some bank for $500. When I asked the employee if that was their bank, he said yes (why isn't it from the IRS???). In addition to that, there was no States Tax calculated and thus not submitted with the Federal Tax documents. In summation, I had to file an amended tax form and won't get my refund for 16-18 weeks and I have to file my State Taxes for the first time... late in addition to paying another company to rectify the whole mess. BEWARE!!!
Walkersville, MD office: Polite and friendly, but more expensive than H&R Block, and only half as professional. They openly discussed prior client's business to me, right when I sat down. Tax "professional" is unshaven, dressed in T-Shirt, and owner in RUMPLED shirt (2 separate days). I'm not judging, just not what I am expecting at such a business. And if you were thinking you get what you pay for, well, they TWICE quoted $250 for what I needed filed and attempted to charge over $600 at the end! H&R Block charging $460 for same in a clean and much more professional environment and personnel.
Went in to get my taxes done because they were close to my work area. As we started taxes, she asked several questions and then asked, "Are you on your way to work?" I said yes. So she said just leave them and you can pick them up after work. She stated that she would call if any questions. I go back to pick them up and they charged me $405.00. I stated why so much. I did the same form last year for exactly $110.00. She explained that they charge by the forms and the forms have gone up since last year. She said my taxes would be given to me when I paid this amount. I have not picked them up yet. They are not a good company to deal with.
I went to the store on Palm Bay road and proceeded to ask the lady as I entered, “How much do you charge to prepare taxes?” She said, "Well let's take a seat and see what you have..." After looking over my stuff she then asked me to sign this little form which I SHOULD have read and to this day I still don't know what it said. Long story short she proceeded to do my taxes... Still asking how much do you charge??? Near the VERY END she says, "We usually charge 300 but you qualify for a discount so it's now 233..." I was floored!!! That was Friday and it's now Monday... Went in to just pay her and get my stuff because now I'm pissed at how I was tricked into getting them done!! Paid her and she tells me to come back Wednesday to pick them up as they electronically file (which I had no idea). So I have to go back Wednesday and HOPEFULLY get my originals which is all I care about at this time!! My advice NEVER SIGN ANYTHING WITHOUT READING and GET THE PRICE UPFRONT for any services... I will not return to Liberty Tax EVER AGAIN!! I'm still not happy about how I was tricked and funny thing is... I'm not getting money back I owe... Please do yourself a favor and do your research BEFORE you go!!
We decided to have Liberty do our taxes this year. I usually do them but had no ink and comp was running slow. We went to the one on 37 Ave in Hobart Indiana, when we went to pick up our taxes. We were getting back leads than 1000, which we usually get back at least 3, and owed 268, which is more than H&R block charges.
I recently went to one of your stores to do my taxes, 72 Main St, Hempstead, NY, and the end results were disastrous. I went to the store 5 times to follow up with my taxes and as many thing were mishandled. I instructed them to call me before filing my taxes so I can find out their fee and answer the questions I had; of course they filed the taxes without calling me or any notice. I provided them my account number for direct deposit of refunds but they just asked the IRS to send a check to their store. I had to go to the store twice to pick up two checks from them. And that’s when I found out the fee I paid them was $515.00. They were supposed to tell me their fee before filing and I would have written them a check but they took their fee from my refund check without informing me. They were supposed to email me a copy of the file taxes and of course they didn't do that as well. I finally got a copy of the filed taxes from their store and went to H&R Block as I was sure they didn't file my taxes correctly. H&R Block found out that the taxes were not done correctly and I had to amend them. I paid $150.00 to H&R Block for the amendment (I have the receipt). My last worry is that the Liberty Tax store didn't have any management or organization and I am afraid my information could be stolen from that store. I am really worried and would like you to take a closer look at that store and make sure they can store client’s information in a safer place. I am very unhappy with what happened to me and would Liberty Tax to refund me the fee that I paid to H&R Block for tax amendment and the fees that I was charged for filing my taxes with Liberty Tax. I could have gone to a regular Tax accountant and I would have paid $200.00 to file my taxes but I thought you guys would be charge me a lower fee and do a better job. I am very disappointed with that specific store and I hope the corporation by taking a look at them can change them for better. Please contact me should you have any questions. Thank you.
The Torrance Ca. Office at 1253 W.Carson st.Torrance Ca.310-782-6700, Has signs all over the place advertising of a cash back now promo. It clearly says a 50 dollar cash back will be given to you upon accepted by I.R.S.of your prepared tax return by them, they will give you the 50 in a couple days. They told me to check back with them in two days to see if it is accepted. And it was but they did not have the money there. They were waiting for the owner to come and he was suppose to have it. Well they did not. The worker who told me is **, general manager. He then told me to come back on Wed. that they pass the money out on Wed. and Friday. Didn't have Wed. nor Friday. It's been 9 days now so today I was told they no longer are doing that promo, that it ended on the 11th of March but yet the signs are still up. He said I'm ass out there's nothing he can do. I took photos of the signs and there are 3 different people who know what I've been through. I'm not a rich man. In fact, I'm poor but I work hard for the money so this li'l $50 may be nothing to some folks but to me it's a lot especially being in the situation I'm in financial standing. SIR, I truly hope you can do something about this and I don't care how long it takes. I will go to court or wait for you to do what has to be done. These people are getting rich off us common folks. THANK YOU FOR LISTENING TO ME. WHOEVER YOU ARE, feel free to contact me.
I filed my return with Liberty and was shocked when the tax preparer told me AFTER she was done preparing the taxes that I owe her $500! I asked her point blank "why is it so Expensive?” She said she charged "per page". What a lie! I can see I am not alone in the Complaints Department when I share my bad experience. Sure, they get you to come in with the promise of getting your return in 21 days but it is now 2 months and I had to deal with the delay with the IRS themselves! Liberty will not help you after they get all your personal data. Next year, I am doing my own taxes and keeping MY HARD EARNED MONEY where it belongs..... with ME!!
I was a former tax preparer at this location. The owner, Frank Tereschak, is in the least amount of words has no sense of customer orientation or even how to effectively run a business. First, he is inappropriate saying political and racist comments. Racist comments pertaining to certain Clients with ITIN numbers. He was talking to a man one day who stopped him saying "My fiancé is Hispanic." He violently yelled at a female customer for a question he phrased wrong. On top of being late to her appointment & excusing himself to "pee". Clients’ files are not locked up and are kept in topless bins in an unlocked, unsecured hallway next to a public restroom. I cannot say that anyone who used the bathroom and passed by these files, also on Mr. Tereschak’s desk with the administrative account logged in at all times; did not access information. On liberty tax folders the outside has names & social security numbers. Inside all pertinent tax information. Same with the administrative the client database of any and all customers. I took pictures and reported this man to the WI Dept. of Agriculture, Trade & Consumer Protection.
** (also known as ** and **) took $250.00 from me as payment for doing my 2012 taxes. He worked out of the Fulton, MO office. He personally mailed my taxes but "forgot" my w-2 and other receipts at his office. I have only spoken to him one time since then, that was October 2013. According to the IRS, they never received my 2012 tax information. Liberty Tax has done nothing to help me out of this mess. ** has all of my most personal identification. He has the potential to ruin me and Liberty Tax is doing nothing to stand by me. Liberty Tax has nothing recorded in their computers, but they do have him as an employee. ** works for Mizzou. He is a thief! If you know of him and have a story please call me at **.
I am pissed that my sister and my niece was ripped off. Liberty Tax charged my sister $850 and my niece $350 to do their taxes. They never knew of the fee until they went in to pick up their checks. When they inquired, the tax consultant told them that they should have known because they signed for it. My family explained to the tax preparer that she had never verbally informed them of any extra fees. And the forms reflecting the fees was given to them when they came in to pick up their refunds. We never did taxes with them before and had no idea that $850 and $350 would be the charge for ERC (Electronic Refund Check). Is there anyway we can complain to get the fees refunded to? In addition, the tax preparer failed to give them all the forms that were filed.
My 22nd old son who is unemployed, homeless, and made a whole 6300.00 last year, unfortunately walked into a Liberty Tax Center. He was to receive $300.00 back from taxes, but Liberty Tax charged him $239.95 for his taxes and he now is receiving a whole $80.00. All he had done was a short form. Personally I feel this was a big rip. You would think that a tax service would take this into consideration and charge according to your income and not rip people off. Buyer beware… I will inform all friends and family NOT TO USE THIS RIP OFF service. Even after completing to the manager he would not help out my son, no matter what. Even with the clause 100% guarantee for any reason. Why guarantee when you don't. Very dissatisfied with this company.
The same thing happened to me last year. I went to liberty tax for the $50. I was told to come back for the $50. They told me that my paper work would be ready in a couple of days & someone would call me, they never did so I went in. They gave me also only 2 papers not the full e-file tax papers. I was quoted a price of $75. They deducted $375 from my refund. They never gave me the paper work that I signed especially from that box that they have you sign. I didn't notice the rip off till this year because I went in February & they were trying to charge me $500. I had to ask them 3 times "what?" I started laughing because I thought the lady was joking! I asked her why it was so much that I didn't pay that much last year. I told her that I've paid $80 at another place before. She proceeded to look up last years & she showed me what they deducted. I was more shocked than pissed off, that a tax place would do that. I told her that they never told me that price AND she said "yeah they probably never told you, that's probably why they gave you only 2 papers." I was speechless. She then said that I am not actually paying for it because it's coming out of my taxes. I told her no and left. After that, I did my taxes online myself. It made me question the other tax places I've been to in the past, Ritax and HR block. The only thing that's different is that Ritax and hr block gave me my full tax papers. I've complained to the BBB. I don't know what my options are or if I even have any, it's been a year.
Last year I used Liberty Tax in Centennial Colorado. First of all they misled me on the final cost. It was over $250. They made mistakes and I had to return 3 times for final preparation. Now I received a call from a complete stranger who upon opening last year's taxes realized parts of mine, including my phone number, address, social security number, wages, etc. were stapled randomly interspersed in hers! I have called several times and am told (for two weeks) their investigating it. This kind woman mailed me all the info she had received - I am appalled at the breach of privacy. I will never use them again. Disgusted!
As a first time filer, I only made just about $6,000 as I began my new job mid-year and only worked part-time. Liberty Tax was never upfront with me about their charges and "beat around the bush" about their standard fee. Being new to tax filing, I trusted the girl. In the end they took $50 out of my little tax return and I didn't even know it until I started asking around that I was totally ripped off. The girl knew I was clueless to the process and took advantage of me.
Just to let everyone know, DO NOT HAVE YOUR TAXES DONE AT LIBERTY!!!! They charged my mom and dad $300 to have their taxes done for filing joint, but charged me OVER $500 for just me. They did not tell me that they were keeping my state refund when I called them on Tuesday. So please take a piece of advice from me, DO NOT HAVE YOUR TAXES DONE BY LIBERTY. They also charged me to have my money directly deposited into my account. So again DO NOT HAVE YOUR TAXES DONE BY LIBERTY TAX SERVICE!!!!! I called them on Tuesday (2-25-14) to find out where my state refund is and they told me they would have something for me in 24-48hrs. I called today (2-27-14) and they told me they took my state refund for fees. I looked at my paperwork and they charged me $516. Why is mine that much when my parents' was only $300 and when I had my taxes done last year it was like $200? Not to mention they charged me $35 to have my refund directly deposited into THEIR account when it would have been FREE to have it deposited directly into my account. This is pathetic!!! I wonder if there is a way for me to get the money I am owed. I know I will be looking into this more and I will not be having my taxes done by them EVER again.
My husband and I went to Liberty Tax to have our taxes filed this year. Our tax preparer was preoccupied to say the least! Complaining that he had other appointments and a conference call he had to deal with. We asked if we could have the other gentleman who was in the office at the time and had no customers with him prepare our taxes seeing this man had appointments and a conference call (By the way we had also made an appointment). He told us he would take care of our taxes and continued to act bothered. After our taxes were prepared, he attempted to charge us over $700.00! Needless to say at that time we left! I later received a call from the tax preparer telling me he could take the price down by $200.00. I told him my husband and I would return the next day. When we returned we got to meet with another tax preparer who was very nice and was trying to assist us even offering a coupon for a free tax preparation. When he opened our file to my surprise it not only contained our tax information, but another customer's private information! Even that tax preparer seemed alarmed at the severe mistake. Unfortunately our original tax preparer came into the office and told us he would finish our taxes even though we requested to stay with the other gentleman. Our original preparer then refused to honor the free tax preparation coupon stating "it was only for new customers." We then complained about the price and questioned it's validity. Our tax preparer became visibly angry at us for questioning him and then went to speak with "Cindy" the manager, who we later found out is actually the owner. He came back and told us that she said she would give us the same price as last year only problem was the price he gave was over $125.00 higher than what we paid last year. When we questioned him and explained the amount we paid last year he dismissed us and kept the price the same. Needless to say we just wanted to be done with the whole ordeal so we paid the price offered. When we got home that same day we found the receipt for last year's taxes that proved we were right. My husband then called Liberty Tax to speak with "Cindy" or another manager and was told no member of management was available to speak with him and they would get his information and have them return his call. Needless to say NO ONE ever returned his call! I believe Liberty Tax is attempting to rip off hardworking men and women in Jacksonville, NC and no one should have to deal with their shady business practices! After further research (went to the Better Business Bureau site) I have found that I am not the only one that has had problems with them. So to make a long story short, due to Liberty Tax's dishonesty, inflated rates, and poor customer service we will never again do business with them!
It's ridiculous. My tax refund is 1,752, only get back 1,068 so charge 694.00. My question, is it legal steal the people money this way?
I went to Liberty for the $50, for which I had to come back, as they didn't have it then. I'd previously had an emerald card, which I liked, aside for the customer service. I know I should've read the fine print, but that doesn't make it right to charge me a dollar every single time I use the card as credit OR debit. They just call the charge another name. I emailed them, but I guess they didn't like what I said, since they didn't respond. I intend to go back to the other company next year.
So I did my taxes with Tax Liberty (which was a huge mistake). I mainly did them there for the $50 promotion. So the lady that did my taxes showed me the price I got and I was fine. I then came in for my check weeks later and got my 2 papers, minding you no papers of my whole e-file. Well, I saw the amount I was suppose to receive and I was shorted $829. So I spoke with another tax preparer and she told me that Tax Liberty charged me $829 to prepare my taxes!! That is ridiculous! She also informed me that they are told not to tell the amount they are charging to prepare people's taxes UNLESS the customer asks! Horrible! DO NOT GO THERE!!
(First I want to say that I spoke to the store owner who called me back within mins of my call complaint into the Corporate Headquarters and was very nice and professional so I do believe this not to be a total company flaw just a problem manager. Well to start my girlfriend is the customer and my daughter and I were tagging along with a close friend that had recommended the services. Now the young lady that prepared her tax return was very nice and polite. All was well until, what I guess was a customer that did not want their services, decided to walk out and the so called manager (WITHIN 15 feet of my 11 year old daughter) thought it would be a great idea to say, "What the ** was that?" I did not bring it up for the fact I am not the kind of person to complain about things. I was however very offended and had to continue to this review when my girlfriend called and had questions on her return and was met with an inconceivable attitude. For a place that is to maintain customer service and/or customer relations I was very appalled. She called back due to the errors and prolonging with her tax return and requested the satisfaction guarantee located on the "Our Written Guarantee" Form. The manager responded with "We don't do that here." What kind of manager doesn't know their own store policies? And how can you forget a policy that you read off to every customer everyday? After that my girlfriend made the mistake of asking a question about the direct deposit charge and I was listening on speaker phone as once again that wonderful store manager told my girlfriend that and I quote, "Don't even think you'll get your money back!" and hung up on her. Now the only thing I can say that made the whole stressful experience better was talking the store owner who was very nice and seemed to actually care for everything we had to say and was also the only person who could answer the seemingly simple questions we had. (Very nice guy. ) It's unfortunate that a manager would ruin a good person's business; however, the rest of the employees were very professional and made us feel welcome. I would try them again if I did not have to deal with a person with no manners or customer care for those around her, especially that of a person who is to be leading others. A thanks to the store owner for being courteous, fixing our problem and yet expressing a meaningful apology.
I filed my taxes today 2/20/2014 and was told by prerarer that that $50.00 is no longer in effect?? ? - Truly false advertisement!!!!
I will never go to Liberty Taxes ever ever again. I was told I was going to get a certain amount from federal and a certain amount from state and when we went to pick up the check, they took extra money out of my federal because they said that the federal amount didn't include the state. I still didn't receive my state yet. Never will I go back or ever refer a friend to them and all the comments I read is all bad new or not happy customers. I feel like reporting them to the IRS for what they are trying to do.
I usually do my taxes myself, but since I'm not working right now I decided to have them done at Liberty because they had a couple promotions going on ($25 bucks for each friend you refer - I referred 3. Then $50 "Cash in a Flash!!!!" when you do your return there). So I went, filed my taxes (on January 30th, mind you), and showed her the coupons from my 3 friends that I referred. She says okay, cool, let me put it in the computer. I also mention that I'm interested in the $50 cash in a flash!!!!! And show her my letter they mailed me saying I'm eligible. She says "Grrr-eat!". Once again, not working, so I elect to have the preparation fees taken out of my total refund. Sounds legit, right? Now, I forgot to bring my banking info with me (routing #, acct. #), so I tell her I'll bring it in tomorrow, and to hold the file until I can bring it in. I return Jan. 31st, give a different lady my bank info, and she puts it in the file. She says I'm all set, they just need to have the manager review everything and they'll file everything the next evening. When I casually ask about my CASH IN A FLASH, this other lady tells me that I can only get that when my refund has been accepted by the IRS. Okay... I wait about a week and a half, and haven't heard anything from anybody. Now, it's Feb 10th, and I'm getting a bit frustrated. So, I go back into Liberty and ask about my tax status... Well, lo and behold, they never even FILED THEM YET because the manager, who has to check every file, has been out on a medical leave. OH OKAY. In the meantime, I had got another W2 in unexpectedly from unemployment, and **, I could use the extra hundred bucks. So I give it to this third lady and she adds it into my file. I start asking her questions about the various promotions, and she tells me that a customer can only be eligible for one promotion, and by the looks of it (what it says in the computer), I chose to have my tax preparation fees lessened (by $40, a promotion I was never even aware of.) I kindly ask this third lady to remove said promotion, stating that I want my CASH IN A FLASH, and my cash for referring friends. She says that she doesn't have the authority to remove anything from a file once it's in, and the manager (who is out on medical leave until God knows when) is the only person who can do that. She says she will give me a call in two or three days when they fix the errors and the return is accepted by the IRS. She leaves a handwritten note in my file to correct the errors. She then writes me out a handwritten bill for $187 dollars for tax prep fees. She adds in a second line +$50 CIAF. I'm getting frustrated, but calm, cool and collected Zoe always keeps her composure. Now, it's February 18th, aka yesterday. I head back to Liberty (good thing I live so ** close, because I'd be pissed if I was wasting a lot of gas) and ask, once more, very politely, what is going on with my file, as I have not heard anything and we're closing in on a month here. The lady (original woman who did my return for me) looks it up, and says, "Oh, it's been accepted by the IRS!" I'm like, "Great, can I have my money now?" Blank stare. I mention the CASH IN A FLASH!!!! She doesn't know what I'm talking about. She shows me the file. The only thing the file says is $237 tax prep fees, to be withdrawn from my refund. I'm irate. I ask to see the receipt the third lady wrote out. Obviously, it's nowhere to be found. I ask if there's a way to fix the fee, which is ridiculously high. She says no, unfortunately, because my refund goes to their bank first to have the money taken out. I ask if they're going to write me a check for the difference of the $50? Nope. Chalk it up to an accounting error. OOPS. Also, my $25 bucks for referring those people? Actually, it's more like $11 bucks per person, because some of the $25 goes towards THEIR prep fees. Don't ask me how. As a sidebar, I got a text from Liberty this morning saying my "funds have been posted to my account." My bank banks in real-time. It doesn't take days for checks and deposits to clear like some banks. No money yet.
I had my taxes done at Liberty Tax and they got me 500.00+ from state only. I disabled, paid monthly. I first asked how much they charged, she said... "Let's figure and find out..." Taxes done, no price yet. They had a cash in pocket special going on, 50.00 after taxes paid for. I asked how much for tax... she said nothing because I get social security and they get something from them. I said ok, then I asked about the 50.00 cash, she gave me a voucher for 20.00 to take to the check-cashing store across the street. I told her... I thought the amount was 50.00, she said because I have SS, the amount is 20.00. I needed the money, what can I say? Later when I called about the status of my refund, customer service said I would get 500.00+. I said, "What? Prep said I would get 300.00+." (This is what I should have said at the beginning, sorry.) I was shocked when I was told I would get 300.00+ and they charged me 250.00+ to do taxes. If I knew this, I would have gone to Accounting Aide Society and don't be worried about how much it would cost. I really want to know if I can get money back or take taxes to get them done at AAS. This is not fair at all. Just because they are near where you live, they pull out all the tricks to get you in, and they use easy money and pop up offices all over. So if I don't get money back I want to tell someone out there, then I will feel this is something for everyone to think about before jumping-head-first. When the lady did the taxes, she said nothing about the price, just 200.00+.... Wow.
I went to file my taxes with Liberty Tax on Jan 30, 2014 for the first time. The lady that prepared my taxes already was acting like she didn't know what she was doing and then was charged $502 to prepare my taxes. I usually use Turbo Tax but didn't want to. This bad decision I was told just for filing my taxes with Liberty they will GIVE me $50.00. That was a lie. When I got my taxes Liberty charged $552 and that's not on my paperwork. Its $502 and that was already too much. Then you take an extra $50.00. I'm reporting this to the IRS and I will NEVER file my taxes with Liberty Tax Service and I won't refer anyone. I will have my taxes reviewed by someone else also. Liberty won't be in business long. One thing you don't play with is people money. You mislead me and gave false information.
I filled my 2013 tax return with Liberty Tax. This year would be my 3rd year trusting them to prepare my taxes. I filled on the 31st of January and was told I would receive my return in 21 days or less. I know that is a standard time frame that they must give you so it gives the IRS time to go review your paper work. Although, I was given a ballpark of about 21 days I decided to track my refund via "IRS where's my refund" website. They informed me my refund would be deposited into my account on 2/10/14. I patiently waited all day to receive the notification from my bank that my refund was deposited. Heard nothing all day. I decided to contact the IRS personally at this point. I needed to speak to someone about this. I was told by the IRS the refund was deposited 2/8/14 into the tax preparer's acct. Not mine!!!!!!! Furious!!! I called Liberty and was told by one of their less intelligent workers it's impossible for a tax refund to be sent out so soon. Then I was told by another worker they don't know where the money is. It must be my bank.... Can someone tell me what the heck is going on here... I am reporting them tomorrow morning if I don't get answers and my money!!!!!
I referred a friend to Liberty Tax Service and gave my friend the Refer a Friend paper that they provided me with. My friend went and had them prepare his taxes. He received his taxes back and they were supposed to contact me when his taxes were approved and received by him so I could come into the office and claim my $50 Refer a Friend bonus. They did not contact me. I had to call them and ask them about it. Today I drove to their office just to get told that I only receive a $31 out of the $50 Refer a Friend bonus. The lady said that the other $19 was taken out of the bonus due to the fees he not me inquired filing his taxes... Does this seem or sound right to anyone??? It clearly states that if you refer a friend you will receive $50. It does not state that if you refer a friend that you will help pay for their tax preparation and receive whatever Liberty Tax Service decides to give you!! Has anyone else had this problem??
Went to Liberty Tax for tax prep. Simple form, no itemized deductions. $400.00! This was the first time I went to a tax preparer, I thought they would all charge the same. I'm going to H&R Block and ask them what they would charge for a simple form. Then go to Liberty and see if they will give some of my money back. If not, I'm reporting this to the IRS, Attorney General, etc.
Liberty Tax Sulphur, LA - The manager is very unprofessional and seems to break under pressure and starts stuttering like maybe he's been hit by lightning in his life, then he squirms out like a worm when he doesn't know a simple tax question, he's disrespectful, unprofessional, anxious. I feel if I do my taxes there, there will be a price to pay later and that office charges too much with people that have not been trained properly. I own my own business and yea I got the free consultation and felt their numbers were wrong and checked them with a second opinion and their numbers were off a lot. Not accurate. Its not worth $50 to lose $1000.
I have been doing my taxes with Liberty for nine years. In 2012 the location was bought out by someone else. The price to do my taxes was misrepresented by the new owners, I was overcharged about $200.00. At least I had a a coupon that saved me $50.00. It did not matter that I have been a loyal customer for the previous eight years. The office manager and staff was rude when questioned about the charges. The location changed hands three times over the last ten years. It took them over three weeks to do my taxes. This year I went to H&R Block, my taxes were completed in 1 1/2 hours, the cost was over $200.00 less than what I was charged the previous year at Liberty. I will never have my taxez done at a Liberty location.
The worst tax "professionals" you could possibly choose to prepare your tax return is Liberty Tax Services. They charged me a ridiculous amount of money to do my taxes and never told me my fees before they sent my forms to the IRS. The management continued to avoid my calls, they've hung up on me when all I had was a couple of questions for them (why they charged me $500 for a few simple forms). They are rude and flat out called me a liar when I politely asked them why the fees were never discussed with me. I have never had such a horrible experience with any company in my entire life. Do yourself a huge favor and keep driving past the goofy statues of Liberty! Do not use them! And don't fall for their gimmicks ($50 on the spot when you file with us!).This company uses legal ways to steal from their customers and its not right.
I would never, nor should anyone, hire a company that subjects employees to dressing up in the rain and cold for awareness. These are HUMAN BEINGS!!! If they want roadside attention they should get a sock blow up. I just witnessed a man in a costume standing In freezing cold rain. That's never okay.
My daughter, who makes minimum wage and who needed a short form tax completed, which takes probably 15 minutes to complete. They charged her $200 dollars to do her taxes. We should have known that they are a rip off when we asked upfront how much it would cost and they told us they didn't know at the time. I could have done it myself in 10 minutes and could have saved her $200 dollars!
I was called by a branch that they were offering a tax course. I went in, got screened in an interview and the divisional manager signed me up. I gave the down payment. Once the course started they were very pushy about paying it off. They don't give you much time to pay it like they are more interested in your wallet than actually guiding you through the process. Once the course is complete, they drag you around like a puppet like they are gonna call you, have you fill out the hiring packet and sign contract. Then change their number and never call you again. Very unethical if you ask me. You have to go through all sorts of offices just to find out what happened to your information or when you start. No one knows who you are and act like they never seen you before. But they sure want your money beforehand. I recommend for everyone to take their course somewhere else like H & R Block.
I went to an office in California for my 2012 taxes. I just had a simple W2 and a 1099 all in the state of California - single, no exemptions, no itemized deductions, no property . I called beforehand to get a quote, the receptionist told me $150. I thought that wasn't too shabby so I go in. Um, it took the gentleman a half hour to do my taxes, it ended up costing me $315. WOW, WOW, WOW. I wish I can get paid $600/hour, where do I sign up to be a CPA? Oh and get this. I asked the gentleman about making quarterly payments to the IRS. He told me he had no idea how it worked and just printed off 20 pages for me to read about it. Those tax preparation classes must be a breeze! Additionally, it's a little too intimate inside, it's one very small room with all the clients and tax preparers. Not much privacy between you and the client at another desk five feet away. I can hear every transaction going on. Moral of story: do your own taxes, they seriously aren't that hard! These tax prep services like Liberty want you think that taxes are overly complicated and not capable of being done correctly by the average person. Just use your past returns as a guide for the new return. Or look online for completely free tax preparation.
They did not give me a Franchise disclosure document until 3 days after I had signed the franchise agreement. And, they later sent me a letter asking me to sign and back date that FDD. That is completely fraudulent, and it violates a FTC federal law.
We thought Liberty Tax was a tax adviser that help consumer prepare the tax and willing to pay the fees for their professional service. Consider our tax refund are pretty easy but still they make a mistake that cost us over thousands in back taxes. How can they make a mistake with such a simple easy return? No appositive given even they admitted wrongdoing. Thank you for showing such as great customer service. Bluffton, SC 29910 Liberty tax location.
I went to the Liberty Tax Service on N. Dixie with my husband. We have had some tax issues in the past, because of a less than honest tax preparation company so we were a little anxious. The preparer, Bee, was able to not only quickly and accurately file our 2011 & 2012 taxes, she helped us resolve our past problems by filing amendments. The price was fair and just about the same as quotes I had received from other companies. We will go to Liberty for life! Thanks, Miss Bee!
At the initial interview, I was lured in to a free tax course in preparation for employment with the company. Then the $159 course fee Bomb was dropped on me. I agreed that this was a worthy investment in a new career. But the agreed payment installments was quickly required at the start of the course. Under pressure from repeated calls, I sacrificed $30 down. The target moved again forcing me to pay the balance by the second course. Since I detected this continually moving payment target, I returned the course materials and had to forfeit my refund since I took notes on the first page. Unemployed, I was not in the position to give away $30 to a business office. They had lunch at my expense. Lesson learned.
This service, located in Brockton, Mass. Failed to document ALL of the financial papers given to them due to the fact that they DID NOT know enough about the tax laws. Consequently, we have to pay out of our pocket for the money they did not report. I implore you, and anybody reading this to stay clear of this co. at tax time. Just take a look at all the complaints they have accumulated on line! We intend to retain a lawyer, and have reported them to the BBB.
I finally got Liberty Tax to pay me back for preparation fees and interest, but that's all. Guess what? I deposited the check $279.00 and it bounced. So now I owe $12.00 more. This is not a business I will ever use again.
We have had our taxes done by H&R Block for at least 30 years and never had a problem. In 2011 and 2012, we went to Liberty Tax to have prepared. Recently I received a letter from the IRS stating that I had not claimed all of our income. I worked for the railroad and retired so we receive a retirement income from the railroad retired board. Liberty Tax Service admitted to making a mistake by not adding all of the W2s. They said they would amend the tax preparation, give us the preparation fees back and pay the interest, but that's all. I went to them in good faith and paid $211.00 for their service thinking they were professionals and that I would have my taxes done correctly. Now I need to come up with approx. $1577.00. That hurts.
I had my taxes done for the 2013 year. After I filed I received another W2 so I took it in for a amendment. That was in February of this year. It is now July. I have received nothing back, not a phone call, not a copy of my taxes despite numerous attempts and messages. I am unable to file my renter's rebate. I am very upset by this unprofessional practice. Previously I had a good experience with this franchise. Needless to say after this is all said and done I will never have my taxes done here.
I first went to the Liberty Tax and started my taxes back in April. The girl didn't enter the extra income that I had brought into her office and also DID not put my banking info correctly, so my check was lost. Then I went back in to have my taxes amended and the lady wanted to make me a daycare out of my apartment and lie about buying things for a daycare (a business I never had in my life). So then we added my nephew to my taxes. Not sure what she DID, but after they were sent off to the IRS and got sent back to me, that additional info was needed. So I went back into that office and the owner started yelling. From my understanding, when I left the store the owner and myself had come to an understanding and the owner fixed the amended return so it was sent off. But guess what? The IRS sent that one back stating info is still needed. But when I went back to the Liberty Tax office, the owner said he was dealing with me and for me to get out of his office... What do I do?
I took the Liberty Tax class and was talking with the owners in working during the busy season. In the classes, I scored very high on all the tests and had the rest of the class looking to me for answers. I spoke to the owners and they said, "Yes, come work for us." In addition, we spoke about their partnership. They explained how they needed new blood and new ideas. All sounded good to me. Well, I called a number of times and was assured all is good and that the call would come soon to work in the location. I went by one time and saw others, that were with me in the class, working. That's okay, but when each of these people had extreme difficulty understanding the tax concepts, passing the tests and communicating ideas, I was a bit shocked to see these results. i was told, "Yes, come back Friday," and I had an appointment at 11:30. Sorry to be specific, but to portray their less than professional attitude, this needs to be explained. The person I spoke with, the person that told me to be there at that time, was conveniently missing. i have seen their work and it is way less than acceptable. Say many tax laws were ignored or violated and their attitude was such that these laws were not so important. They may have this posted in their locations, but, in reality, this is not their practice. In addition, doing this business for years, MY rates, and I am a CPA, are about 1/2 of what they charge. So, should you want to have your taxes prepared by incompetent preparers that do not care and that charge at least twice what CPAs charge, I invite you to let them do this for you. For me, think I'LL build a good practice that focuses on people that want accurate returns.
Be careful when tax season is coming back around, especially when you are trying to sign up for the classes. I attended the class, paid my hard earned money to attend the class, and I was ripped off by Liberty Tax services. They are not to be trusted. They allowed me to complete the first part of the class and then they disallowed me to complete the second half of the class, which is the main part of the class, the computer modules training and the completion of tax preparer readiness test. They ripped me off for my money. That's all that they wanted to get, my money. I never wanted to work with their company. I just went there to enroll in the continuous education classes and that was it. I never had plans to work at that company. They rip people off. I do not know what happened and what the consequences were. After I completed the first part of my training, they told her to go to another office, which is located on the main street in East Orange, NJ. So, I reported to Liberty Tax for my second half of the training, and they would not allow me to do the classes. They never told me the reason why, so I started asking questions. I asked what they all do. Do they collect people’s money and do not allow them to complete the training classes? I kept on asking questions to find out why. They never responded with the correct answer. The trainer that I had in East Orange, NJ at the Central Avenue office said there is no reason why I should not be able to take the second part of the training. I told them at the office in East Orange, NJ at the Main Street office, and they told me that the instructor should not have told me that. Therefore, they get people to sign up for training classes to get their money, and then they do not allow people to complete the classes...Liberty Tax ripped me off of my hard earned money. I was dissatisfied and will never refer anyone to Liberty Tax. I do not want my friends and family to get ripped off like they ripped me off.
The guy who did my taxes did a great job filing. He even gave me some great advice. Here's the dissatisfactory part. I was told that I could pick up my paperwork on the following Monday (I filed on a Friday afternoon). He said that if I didn't pick up my paperwork within a week, they would mail it to me. There was no mail, and the place is gone like it never existed. I was told that it was a franchise location just for the tax season and I should go to the main office in Cumberland. It was the same deal; they were never there during posted business hours, just an answering machine. So I called yet one more fairly local office just to see if anyone is around. I actually got someone and she said she has personal phone numbers of the other employees at the Cumberland location and she'd call them - no return call. I contacted the customer service on the website which was quite helpful but was told they have up to 48 hrs to contact me after they send them a notice. They have 15 hrs left. Great initial experience, horrible follow-through!
A friend used these guys and never received his $50 for referring my daughter! She filed state tax and has not received it yet, 2 months later. They also misplaced her return in another person's file? Angry!
Liberty Tax, Mount Pocono, PA - Staff is unprofessional. Incorrect paperwork was given to the clients and inappropriate behavior when questioned about false/misleading remarks. Staff is easily agitated and becomes verbally aggressive when questioned. Excuse ranges given for incorrect paperwork were: We are too busy; there is just too much work; tell me where you live, I will come to your house and correct it. The people that made the program for the tax preparation tool designed it wrong and some other computer programming excuse that does not even make any sense. It is the client's job to know if the paperwork is correct and complete. Clients do not see completed paperwork until after payments are made and finalized in system. I just entered the data. If the computer put in the incorrect information, it is not my fault.
I want to let others know how bad of an experience I had with this company. My wife and I had our taxes done and we had to come back up to have them do an injured spouse form. Well, they filled the form out for us and we asked what we needed to do when we sent it back. They said just mail it back to the state on MI, so we did. A couple weeks later, we receive a statement saying half of my wife's refund was being taken due to not sending a copy of our lease. So I call the treasury dept. and they told me to read the instructions. Lo and behold, it says "If proof of sole ownership or leasehold is not received with this form, the credit will be divided between both spouses." Well, with this new info in hand, I called Liberty Tax to find out why I paid to be told wrong information. A woman named Tiffany ** answered and I started asking why no one said to send my lease copy with the form. She told me that I do not need to and that the state of MI is just trying to get everyone's money. I read the line from the form to her and after each of the 4 times I read that to her, every time I would finish stating the instructions, she would tell me I was wrong and each time, she got more degrading and snotty with me because I will argue if you keep telling me that the instructions are wrong. So after about 30 minutes of her telling me I was wrong, I was fed up with the call and asked her if I could speak to a manager. She got real snotty with me and I told her that once she started getting rude with me, I started recording the conversation. So she said that she can't talk to me and that she's going to call the cops on me for that. So now, I got really mad that she said she's going to call the cops for recording her when it was legal to do so. So now, when I told her I want a manager and that I recorded the call, she started telling me I was acting like a baby and so forth and hung up the phone. I tried calling back after being hung up on, but got no answer. So I called corporate and made a complaint. An hour later, the cops came. Tiffany told them that I threatened her because I said I'd come up later. How that's a threat, I have no clue. I had the paperwork from the state which showed they were wrong and instead of saying to bring it up and show her, she kept ramming it down my throat that I was wrong so how is it a threat for me to say I'm going to show her the proof she was wrong. Nope, she called the cops saying I threatened to come up there after they messed up our taxes. It took three days for the franchise owner, Mario Quinto, to return my complaint call which corporate said he would call within 24 hours. So my wife and I got a call from Mario telling us to bring the paperwork after arguing for 20 minutes. I got there and showed him the form and he admitted that I do in fact need to send in a copy of my lease, but that's all he did and not once did he apologize for them giving us the wrong info. So we are talking and he started talking down upon my wife in front of me. I told him to stop with the degrading of us and this man started to giggle. I held my composure for this man even as he treated my wife like garbage and we kept talking about this. And after like 20 minutes of talking and saying he will let customers from now on know they need to send in the copy of the lease, he said there's nothing he will do. He also said that the tax laws change and this must be new. But Michelle at MI Treasury who worked there for 10 years said that you have always needed to send in the lease. So Liberty has been misfiling people’s taxes for many years. When we came to get our taxes done, we expected the tax preparer to know what the instructions say and if we pay for them to give us tax advice, then it needs to be correct. In my case and many other people's cases, Liberty did not know how to fill out Form 743. In my case, not only did everyone tell me I was wrong but they had the cops harass me and my wife lost about $250. Their site says, "If an error is made in the preparation of the customer's return that results in a cost of interest or penalty, we will pay that interest and penalty." Well, this was a penalty that cost my wife $250 that she was not obligated to pay and these people and this Mario guy refuse to honor their company's word because they made an error. Bottom line, I would not advise anyone to visit Liberty because they in fact do not know how to fill out this one form and I want to know what else they don't know about taxes. But also Tiffany and all the people I have talked to at this company have zero customer service skills at all and they cannot accept the fact that they were wrong.
It's the one on Main St., Fort Worth. Today, 4-8-13, I went to see what I owed to IRS. This guy is crazy and fees are horribly high. My concern is, what is going to be done w/ my private info? He did not want to give me back his green piece of paper where my SS, my name and home address is.
We had a very bad experience with Liberty Tax Service this year. Since we told the consultant that we wanted Direct Deposit and provided the necessary and correct information, we assumed that it would be deposited into our account. What we were not told was that it was being deposited into an account that Liberty set up with River City Bank in Kentucky only to have JTH Financial Services take a cut so they can then deposit it into our account. I have taken steps to have JTH Financial block the deposit into their company. According to the IRS, the refund was already deposited into that created account. Now, I am trying to contact River City Bank to find where my money currently is.
Tax year 2012, I filed my taxes with Liberty Tax and was told I would have to do an amended return due to the IRS not taking education credits until Feb. 15th. Fine. So I went back in on the 25th and filed my amended return. Now since this return was filed on paper, I knew it would take some time. One month later and I received a letter from the IRS stating they need more information. Seems that my tax preparer did not include all of the appropriate paperwork with my amended return. I would need to have my tax preparer fill out the appropriate paperwork and send it back in with the corrections. I am now, because of her ignorance, looking at another 2-3 months for it to be processed. Had she done her job correctly, I would have already had my return. I will never go back to Liberty Tax. I urge anyone thinking of using them to stop in your tracks and do not go there. Customer service is poor and they do not call back when they say they will. I should have done my research before going there. That is my mistake.
I filed my taxes before Jan. 30, 2013 with this company and I waited until 2/14/13 for them to transmit my taxes, because I have school credits to file. I was supposed to get my refund on 3/6/13 but due to the incompetent preparer, they entered the wrong bank account number and my funds were deposited into the wrong account. I called so they can rectify the issue, and I was assured that I was going to get a call back and never received one. So now, I'm playing a waiting game.
I went to Liberty Tax to get my taxes filed. I opted to use the direct deposit option and was ensured I would get my refund timely. The IRS sent my money to them on March 6, 2013. It is now 03/15/2013 and I have yet to get my refund! They told me the bank they use has been trying to get the direct deposit to go through. I asked them to cut me a check and they are refusing to do so. This is my last year going to them. Do not use direct deposit with this company!
I recently purchased a Groupon for Liberty Tax preparation services. The location (750 Allerton Avenue Bronx, NY 10467) was listed as a participating branch and I called to verify. The tax preparer refused to honor the voucher. He stated that I must pay $59 for my taxes to be prepared. I explained that I had already purchased the services and showed him documentation (the voucher and my account history). I requested to speak with his boss and he informed me that his boss was busy. He finally provided me with the owner's contact information after several minutes of badgering. I tried calling several times, but was always told that he was busy or had stepped out.
Tax Liberty did my taxes fine. It’s the bank they deal with - that is the problem. When the IRS releases your tax refund and it goes to Tax Liberty’s bank to be processed, they hold your return for 5 days and they don’t tell you that, when you get your taxes done, so just beware. And when they release you check for direct deposit, it will be almost a month and they say direct deposit is the quickest way to go. Yeah right.
I went to a Liberty Tax office to get my 2012 return prepared. I was given an information sheet in which I had to write all my information, including my account and routing number, also specifying whether or not it was a checking or savings account. I checked savings because I have a savings account, not checking. A few weeks later, I called to check the status of my refund and I was told it was deposited into my account on Feb. 13th. But when I called my bank, it wasn't in my account. A few days had passed and still my funds were not in my account. I called Liberty again and I was told the same - to give it a few more days. I finally got a hold of the manager at Liberty Tax bank. I asked her to verify my account information. That's when I found out they deposited my funds into a checking account, not my savings account. I was furious. No one had any answers nor were they apologetic. I was told I would be refunded my prep fees, but I still haven't received anything. Everyday I call, someone tells me they'll get back with me but they never do. I would never ever recommend this place to anyone, not even my worst enemy. Be very, very careful. They are not upfront about their fees either. I've contacted the BBB as well. Eventually, my complaint will be listed on the website. That's how horrible it has been.
I went to Liberty Tax last year with the same agent in Hawthorne, CA on Hawthorne Bl who messed me up bad last year. I got my return 2 weeks late. Well, this is where it gets funny. I went back again. This time, the same agent (JV) screwed me bad. Not only this year did I have to go back 5 times, she could not even work the computer good like she did last year. She does not even know how to do taxes. Well, this is my fault. After being there for hours, I was asked if I wanted a copy of my return. What?! Well, of course, I do. Anyways, I waited for the $50 and was told they did not have the key. Know note that I've never seen that $50 from last year, so then I was told the owner will be back in 2 hours. I told them I'll wait. Well, they went in their purse and gave me $50. Now, this is where it gets good. I have not gotten my return due to her putting the wrong amount for earn income credit. I'm not sending them my SS card, my niece's SS card and my rental agreement. Now, I'm waiting on my letter to fax over this paperwork. When I called Liberty taxes and told them, they said they would call me back. (Lol) They never called back so I called back. When I got the owner, I could hear JV say, "Dang, she has been calling all day." How rude. Heck yeah, I'm going to call all day when it comes to my money. These people take your money, are very rude and do not know how to do taxes. They should never do taxes again. I want to tell everyone not to go to any Liberty Tax especially in Hawthorne, CA. You will be sorry.
Just like the H & R Block complaints, Liberty Tax lied to me as well. They had told me that I would have my taxes done by Feb. 1. I was there on 01/20/2013. I was told that I would be charged over $400 for the prep. and misc. fees. Well, it is now 02/21/2013 and I have not received any call backs from Liberty Tax. I have no refund yet, and they said that their product ended on 02/13/13. Well, tax season ends in April 2013 - this was false advertising. They knew I had educational costs that I included and did not tell me that the IRS was reviewing these taxpayers on 02/15/13 - I only found out on the Irs.gov web home page. They conveniently closed their rapid refund product on 02/13/2013. This is false advertising, causing consumer confusion, misleading, and I think a class action should be filed against this company that is owned by Hewitt.
I have had the same tax agent for the last four years. In 2012, he screwed up on my taxes and I had to file an amended return due to his mistake on tax papers. My return was good in 2012 and was over $6,000. I paid for the agent to prepare. It was in the amount of $378. In April of 2012, I got a letter in the mail from IRS stating mistake on my taxes and I need to file an amended return to correct. As minor as the mistake was, I had to pay again the agent all because he didn't input the amount of my school deduction so this cost me another $278. This was of course after a ton of phone tag messages and nonsense about paying more. The same agent didn't even correct; he in fact pushed my taxes on to someone else. I wiped the slate clean because I had been going to Liberty in Morris Plains for 3 years and up until 2012 I was happy. This year in 2013, I attempted to file my tax papers as usual and my tax preparer talked me into filing electronic. He didn't however add my education deductions in and lied to me and said that it didn't make a difference, yet I took his word. He told me not to worry if my taxes get rejected as we will re-file the paper. They were rejected and they were rejected two days after they were submitted. I found out they were rejected 12 days later. The worst part about it was that my tax agent didn't even call me to tell they were rejected; another agent called. No one could tell me why they were rejected. I had to play phone tag for 3 days to end up having to call IRS myself to get help and find out why my taxes were rejected. I spent 4 hours on the phone with the IRS to find out a solution to my problem because the person I paid to do this failed to find a solution for my problem and instead told me that I would have to pay to re-file paper. However, I was told by two other representatives in the office that I don't have to pay twice because the first time was never done. Another poor attempt to get money out of me. So I was contacted on Tuesday that they will redo taxes on Wednesday; however, every time I call to set appointment for Wednesday, he was busy. I called and left messages to call me back. Instead, I don't get a phone call returned until Sat. Then I was left a message that they're trying to find a solution to my issue and ask the owner if I don't have to pay more to redo taxes. After another four days and they were open all four days, I finally had enough. I went there to get my W-2s and 1099s to take elsewhere. I was misled by the rep and my taxes were rejected on his negligence. I would not recommend anyone to go there. The management has sent the place in a downward spiral and the place is trying to be experts at taxes, insurances and financial services yet how could they be financial experts when they can’t even do my taxes? The best part was them bad mouthing the IRS and Liberty Taxes only got me $1,900. Yet, when the IRS did my taxes, I’m getting $7,985 and I didn't have to pay to get my taxes prepared. The lies, the cheating, I wouldn't trust this or any Liberty Tax location. Beware. I also filed complaint with IRS and the Better Business Bureau.
Liberty Tax Bergen Ave., JC, N.J. - First off, my overall experience with Liberty was horrible. Going there was my worst choice ever. The things that my tax agent advised were not correct. The information he was giving was half true. He estimated every one refund to be there the 11th. They also told me no later than the 15th; still there is no refund. They lied to me and said that they called me which was a lie. They charged me twice what anyone else would. The $50 they give you is billed to your refund.
I had an appointment for 3 days at Liberty in Walmart in Lakeville, MN. I was there waiting for an hour. No agent showed up. I tried the phone number, left 3 messages and there were no call backs. It's the worst service ever. No one showed or even gave me a courtesy call. I won't be back after an hour's wait and I will pass my experience along to others!
After three years of having the same cool person in Liberty Tax do my taxes, I got a very unpleasant experience. This year, the excellent preparer is gone from Liberty, and the manager that I got was very mediocre at best. My returns have been very similar though a bit complex. My charge had been about $400 each year - a bit expensive, but I thought it was worth it. This year they wanted about $860 for the same amount of work. After much arguing, they returned all of my paperwork and I walked out. I sincerely hope that they are respectful with my private information.
I went to Liberty Tax this year for tax preparation and they told me a simple return was only an $80 fee so I proceeded with my taxes. They did not tell me that because of a 1099 form, it's no longer a simple return. They proceeded with my taxes and at the end, they charged me $250. I did not want to sign anything but they held me like a hostage with all my paperwork until I agreed to pay.
Liberty Tax has the highest tax prep fee in the Kansas City area. They attempted to charge me over $540 to file a simple form 1040 and they would have gotten away with it if it wasn't for their own incompetence. To start off, I waited over an hour while the woman struggled to complete the return. She needed help every 5 minutes from the other equally ignorant workers. Finally, at the end, I received my $50 (which was the only reason I went to them). After 4 to 5 days, I began checking to see if my return was accepted by IRS and they had no record that I even filed a return, let alone was it even accepted. I contacted Liberty again (for the third time) and they told me that woman didn't complete my tax return fully, and that it wasn't saved. That said, they wanted me to come in and redo the process again. Of course, I didn't go back, but thanks for the $50, Liberty! Stay away from Liberty Tax. You've been warned!
I have used Liberty Tax service for the past two years. I have never had a problem. This year, I selected direct deposit being financially aware and trying to spend my money right. I also referred some friends as well. My funds were released from IRS on 2/4 and should've been deposited within 4 business days. I have yet to receive my money or friends I have referred. IRS has confirmed they have sent it to them. They keep pushing me to JTS as their bank, but they are just a transmit for them. They will not advise what the bank is and they just want to keep saying, "Allow 4 business days." I am very upset and disappointed because over the past 2 years, they had earned my trust. I have referred this company that can't honor the service, thus, making me look bad also.
The girl doing my taxes did not know what she was doing; it was a mess. Some other guy had to help her and still, another woman had to come help those two. When I usually file my taxes, I leave feeling good and safe. When I left there, my head hurt. They did not even give me all my papers. I got a call 2 days later by the supervisor that I had to come back in and sign more papers. That's sad. I will never use them again. I will go back to H&R Block; they have workers who know what they're doing. My paper also said I wanted money in 48 hrs when I got home and I never wanted that. They are a mess there, paying $500 to dummies.
First, I was approached by a rep from Liberty Tax Service stating that they would do my taxes for a certain fee, only to find out that I was lied to not only on this matter but also about receiving a certain amount. I found out later the amounts did not match. When I approached management, I was told I was lying. I was also promised a return within 48 hours which also was a lie. I went to their office to ask what's going on, only to get the runaround. So my best advice to anyone thinking of using this company is beware of a bunch of cheats and incompetent people working for this company.
My fiancée and I went to file his taxes on Jan. 31st, 2013. We were told that there was an hour wait time and to go to the location inside our local Walmart if we wanted to be seen sooner, so we took the trip to Walmart. We sat there for at least an hour, if not a little longer, while the woman tried to file his taxes. She spent more time on the phone trying to get help than actually filing. She finally got them filed and quoted us $45 for the prep fee. We were very pleased. She went to print the paper work out and got the forms up for my fiancée to sign and told us there was a problem. Apparently, the computer deleted my fiancée’s file. We were then informed to go back to the office and the woman there would pull it up for us. We were told we would receive the $50 cash when we signed the paper work at the office. We went back down to the office, walked in and the woman called us back. She couldn't find my fiancée’s taxes either, so we had to sit for another hour while this woman re-filed them. In the meantime, a man came in demanding his forms back, insisting that he was promised they would be filed a day prior and he was still waiting. He said he was going somewhere else to get them done. We should have taken that as a hint to grab our papers and leave as well. However, we stayed. After about an hour of this woman filing the taxes, we were told that my fiancée could not claim me as a dependent because I do not work. I have no income and we have no children. There is no way of proving that we have been together for 7 years. Then she hit us with the prep fees of $235! I said, hell no! We were quoted $45 and that's what we're paying! It was their mess up after all! After fighting with them for at least 20 minutes, we were finally told that we would only have to pay the $45. However, because of all the deductions they took off the prep fees, we would no longer get the $50 in cash. Needless to say, I was pissed! We left and went home. Something didn't feel right to me so I pulled the paper work out and started to go through it. We were missing over half of the forms and I discovered there was $241 unaccounted for that we were docked. I had my fiancée call up the next day to find out what was going on and to get the rest of his paper work. We got the runaround, and we have since been fighting with them. We were told by a friend, who has a friend who works for H&R Block, that he did have the right to claim me as a dependent. My fiancée called Liberty Tax and told them that he wanted everything canceled and that we were taking our business elsewhere. Of course, it was "too late". He again demanded his paperwork back so we could at least get a second opinion - still waiting on them. My fiancée was told today by the branch runner, Rebecca, that he did not qualify for the 24/48 hour return (which is what we paid for), we would not get that money back and that if I posted anything about them on Facebook, they were going to have me arrested for slander. I would not recommend anyone, not even my worst enemy, to go to Liberty Tax. That was the biggest mistake of our lives, to date. We have never received service like that from anyone, ever. (They are) the most unprofessional, ignorant, and uncaring people around! If anyone is thinking of going to them, please rethink it!
I was told that I would be getting about $314 back so I was kinda okay with that. Then I'm told that my fees are going to be $313. So, this guy sketched out to the back and came back saying they'd knock off fees because I'm such a great guy. They still charged me $125. I'm getting more from state than federal and I'm going to sue unless I get my $125 back, on the grounds that H&R Block could do my taxes cheaper.
Liberty Tax did my taxes wrong! I have been filing with them for the last three years, ever since I bought my house, because I figured it would be easier than doing them myself. I was sure wrong. In 2010, they put in the wrong amount for my mortgage insurance deduction. I received a nice return, spent the money of course, and now I get a surprising letter from the IRS saying they caught the mistake and I owe them about $2,800. Liberty Tax admits the mistake but is only willing to pay the interest and penalties I have incurred from the IRS so far, about $300. They didn't offer to refund the fees I paid them to file/mess up my return, or any future fees I will be charged as I make payments to the IRS or interest fees on a credit card I might have to charge it on. I have called the corporate office 2 times just to verify that this is the policy and they don't even call me back. I have paid around $500 for Liberty Tax to file my returns over 3 years, and now it is going to cost me a few hundred dollars for their mistake. Plus, it is frustrating when you get extra money and spend it and now I have to figure out a way to pay for stuff I wouldn't have bought. I plan on doing my taxes myself from now on. But if I couldn't, I would go to H&R Block. Not like I want to plug some corporation but Liberty Tax doesn't even offer a guarantee to cover the costs you might get from them messing up. I did call H&R Block and they seemed about the same in price to file and said for about $30 more, they will guarantee the return up to like $5,000, even paying my taxes. Paying a little more to get things done right doesn't sound bad about now. I am sure I can do a better job myself.
My husband and I have never been to Liberty Tax Service before. We were told that they had the best prices and offered $50 each after we get our taxes done. I asked the woman how much they charged and how much per form. She said we would discuss after the taxes were done. I thought that was odd but continued on. After a long wait of getting the paperwork done, I was happy to see how much we were getting back. Then, came the charge - $394.00 for a simple form tax preparation! I was floored. I asked her again how much they charged per form - she didn't know. She walked out to ask and came back still not knowing! I immediately canceled and grabbed my paperwork. As I walked out upset of wasting my time, I looked over to a poor customer and told her to ask how much they charge before signing a thing. The woman started yelling at me, saying I had no right to say that and to leave. She followed me out as she was yelling that I had no right to tell a potential customer to watch out for hidden costs. I will never ever ever allow anyone I know to do business with this company. I went to an actual tax preparer and was charged $180 for everything out the door. That should prove how much they scam poor people out of money.
My husband and I filed our taxes with Liberty Tax Services. First, they told us we were approved for the loan to get your money quicker and called us to come pick up our check. We got there and were told that the software was down and it would be a day or so. Then, we went this morning to sign for our check to receive it today. We went and then waited 3 hours, and our check still didn’t come through. I had to beg them to call the bank, and they said that our funds from the IRS had come through and our loan was cancelled. So now I paid to get the loan (got approved) and then the bank cancelled it. Now, I have to wait 21 days. I will not use this tax service ever again and do not recommend it to anybody.
I filed early. They submitted on the 30th saying I’d get my RAL in 1 to 2 days. They never called; I had to. They said my check was ready yet every time they try to print it, it won't?! It’s now days later and the manager still has no answers nor a check for me?!
I filed my taxes with Angela ** at Liberty Tax in 2012. Angela prepared my taxes incorrectly, which resulted in an overpayment from the IRS. The IRS is requesting the money back. Liberty Tax's website guarantees the accuracy of all prepared taxes. They promise to refund any preparation fee for any reason, if not satisfied with their services. I requested my prep fee back and they did not honor their guarantee. They just ignored my phone call and gave me the runaround. This is a sleazy business. Liberty Tax's correct phone number is 323-759-4304.

My experience with Liberty Tax has been terrible. They have let franchise to people who are not experienced. They have fixed incorrect tax that has caused me with penalties. They claim that they will repay the penalty, but they will never do. They have rejected my request to refund my penalty, giving explanation that makes no sense. I have tried approaching lawyer, but suing them turns out to be expensive. Students, please do not approach these guys anywhere!
The entire experience was horrible! First, the Pikesville, MD office was very unorganized. When the taxes were complete, they didn’t give me a copy and told me to “come back tomorrow” to get my packet. I came back three times, and they stated, "We can’t find it." In view of this, I started feeling like I made a bad decision in coming to them! I usually do my own taxes. However, I went to Liberty as I was a part year resident and I didn’t want to make a mistake on my taxes. Unfortunately, the very reason that I went to them ended up being the very thing that they completely messed up! I received a letter 3 years later from the state informing me that the part year resident portion was completely incorrect and they were seizing my bank accounts. I tried calling the location that prepared the taxes, only to find from another franchisee "that location went out of business”! And rightfully so, as if they did to others what they did to me, it stands to reason why they could not remain open, even for limited hours off of tax season. As well, the tax preparers at this location are not knowledgeable. It's clear that the standard for choosing tax help is low. My preparer was very young and obviously a college student that was just making some "change" during tax season. If I could give you any advice, it would be not to go to Liberty if you are itemizing, have a business, or any complicated tax preparation needs. Three years down the road, I'm dealing with paying the state money that could have been avoided had I gone to a real professional!
In both 2008 and 2009, my tax returns were done wrong. After receiving letters from the IRS, I talked to owner Jesse ** of Chula Vista, CA branches. He told me simply to pay the amounts owed. I asked him about contacting the California Tax Board and assured me there would be no problems. Now, almost 3 years later, I have just received a letter from the Tax Board. I have to pay interest plus the miscalculated amount. Apparently, he hires relatives and people that are still in school. He keeps giving me vouchers for free tax preps for the following year. The third time, I had to tell the tax preparer which amount to include, because she didn't know! And they call that a professional service?
Listed below are the mistakes that were made: 1. A call was made to Mrs. ** that the tax folder was ready. Mr. ** picked up the folder. After returning home, he discovered there were no W2s. 2. The following day Mrs. ** went in to the Fontaine location to retrieved copies of the missing W2s and discovered the original return amount was increased by $1000. How could this much money be missed? Mrs. ** spoke to someone on duty about the situation but no resolution was met. 3. Mr. ** called into the Fontaine location to check the status of the return. He was told a check was ready for pick up. Mrs. ** came in to sign for the check. Mrs. ** again explained the situation to someone on duty and asked why a paper check was issued when direct deposit was always the method we have always used. The person on duty indicated the account was rejected. On February 21, 2012 a letter was received by Republic Bank which stated a direct deposit (the same account) for our state return would be issued; however, the fees that were charged made the return $0.00. After looking at the math, there was an error with the calculation. $39.00 is unaccounted for. This entire situation indicates a lack of competence at this particular office. We, as consumers, have many different options for which to file our taxes. We went with Liberty because we’ve used them in the past at other locations in other states, each time without issue or hassle. It was not until filling our 2011 taxes at the Fontaine location that we have come across terrible service. The above-mentioned issues are too numerous to ignore or excuse. In light of these issues, we requested a full refund of all services which was denied by the Fontaine manager and owner. Service like this is unacceptable and we will like a response within 5 business days. At this time they are still refusing to pay us back the fees that were charged and we are still missing money from the return. Please let me know what my options are at this point.
Liberty tax messed my taxes up. I wanted the RAL loan and they filed it wrong. I will never deal with them again. I should have let a friend do them on Turbo Tax. I would already have my money. I've been waiting two weeks.
Liberty Taxes should be terminated as a tax service and should be reported to the IRS for fraud and dishonesty and also for getting people audited. They don’t know how to do their job and have messed up my taxes. Now I must wait even longer. Thanks, Liberty Taxes. You guys suck!
I received a letter from the IRS that my unemployment wasn't listed on my taxes from last year. I took them to Liberty Tax Service at 9622 Monroe Road, Charlotte, NC 28270. I pulled out the paperwork and saw that my unemployment was listed on the front summary sheet, but omitted from my 1040. I called the corporate office and they told me I'd hear from a manager within 24 hours. I waited 48, and after not getting any calls, I called the corporate office back. They told me my complaint would go into the "critical issues" caseload and I should hear something back soon. It's been another 48 and I've heard nothing. Some type of reparations should be made for this costly mistake on their part and I feel that it's unfair that I'm being held responsible when they are the professionals!
I filed my taxes through Liberty Tax Service on West Broad Street in Columbus Ohio. I paid over 300$ for the 24-48 hour loan on Wednesday, February 18, 2012. It is now Saturday, the 21st. Four days later, I still have no money and the owner said he doesn't even know what to tell me because he doesn't even know what the problem is and he is working on it. I still have no money. This is the most terrible service I have ever received in my life. This was the first time I have used Liberty for my taxes and will definitely be the last.
Liberty Tax Service made a mistake on my income tax return, and IRS caught it. Liberty blamed the computer. A Richard ** from Liberty stated that he would correct the paperwork and forward to IRS. Now, IRS is coming after me for additional PMT with interest and Liberty Tax can't be contacted. What am I supposed to do? IRS says that I owe $808 in back taxes. I can't get a hold of Liberty Tax that completed my return. I don't have the money to pay IRS, let alone having to pay another tax service to help me correct this.
On 8/10/2011, I went to this office to apply for education credits for tax years 2010 & 2009. I was quoted a charge of $89.00 for both tax years, for a total of $178.00. It took about 45 minutes to complete. He gave me two envelopes with the paper work inside. And he told me that on 8/26/11, I can come pick up my first check. I never looked over the forms until 8/13/11. That's when I found out that he's charging me $460.00 for year 2010. And the other charge is $150.00, for a total of $610.00. For tax year 2009, he's charging $213.00. I know that this is robbery in first degree. I qualify to receive $5,700.00. And I'm eligible for 2,500 plus for both years. However, they have me scheduled to receive $1,000.00 for 2009 and 1,500 for 2010. I want to stop payment on my education credits until I can get all of the state funds that I'm due, which is $5,700.00 minus $823.00. I need a way to notify the IRS immediately, before my funds are disbursed. Please tell me what I can do asap. I hope that my complaint has been issued early enough to stop this fraud from happening to me.
I was told by Stephanie ** that the price for preparing my tax return would normally cost $69.00, but with my $20 discount coupon, only $49. After I had to sit there an unusual long time, with the woman answering the phone, talking with customers and having personal conversations, I was given the paperwork and no signing. I left the tax office. When I got home, my boyfriend Jeff ** read over the documents they gave me. Jeff pointed out that they were charging me over $400.00, but it did not break the cost down. The next day, I returned to the office demanding correction or for them to stop the return. Stephanie gave me the paperwork back and I was going to go to another tax preparer. But the next day, I got a call from the owner who said he could not stop the return because he filed it electronically, but would give the balance due once my return came in. When it did, he (the owner, Dwayne) was not there. The man, whose name was Gustavo, said the owner would be in the next night. I went the next night and he was not and neither the next after that. This continued with me calling day and night. Finally, I spoke to him (the owner, Dwayne Davidson) five days later by telephone. He gave me some double talking nonsense about some cost to him and that no further money would be returned. I had already cashed the check given to me, so my only recourse was to demand the full money back as they advertise in the paper, in the office on the wall and on the flyer that "if not completely satisfied, the customer may have a complete refund of preparation fees". The owner said that there is no grounds to request a refund. They falsely advertised that guarantee, the $20 coupon discount was never given because they overcharged me $353.00. So the coupon was falsely advertised. The owner lied to me, sent me on a runaround back and forth con job, then stole from me. I have witnesses to what was said and the dishonest actions of Liberty Tax Service.
I have not been reimbursed on the 100% money back on tax preparation fees from Liberty Tax Service, in the amount of $278.95. Tax preparation was on 01/28/2011. I called the corporate office in Virginia beach, VA on about 02/01/2011 for my refund.
