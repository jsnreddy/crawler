H&R block should expand all across India and also tax advisors should work faster or there should be more tax advisors so that work finishes on time.

i am supported by Mr.Vaibhav of H & R block,Very happy with his support.  
You Tax Expert should give more advise on how to claim returns.  
H&R Block guided me through filing my India income tax return. They were very knowledgeable and helpful. Thank you H&R Block.  
Easy to reach your team, friendly UX is the most important attribute of your model which I appreciate..!  
Please keep up the good work and customer focus. Appreciate!  
best reliable and quick responded service ever i have gone through.  
1.Cost is in higher end2. Didn't give proper information on us filling.initially they said I need to go to us consulate for stamping after 2 months they said no stamping required .3.details entered in the tax form were not accurate. Tax consultant didn't updated the information even after providing the documents .4.2 times rework on the filled form. You can check my email communication.  
Simple and efficient.  
Excellent Service. Prompt response. Makes tax filing seem like a walk in the park.  
Bhavesh was an amazing executive to work with. It was such a pleasure. Responsiveness and Patience exhibited by him were exemplary.  
The site say "give a missed call to the said number and the consultant will call back". However, except for once, no one ever cared to call me back. Its only after i had sent across a message did someone care call me.  
Good service  
Fast response and really the process is hassle free  
Thanks to my tax advisor Mr Vaibhav. He helped me with the year's filing in just few mail exchanges i.e. efficiently and effectively. Also I got his personal direction on long-pending arrears that connected me to the right team(s). I value H&R Block services a lot and recommend to anyone who needs guided filing  
The tax advice and support extended by tax advisor was worthy & excellent and helped me a lot.  
the response from my Consultant M/s Dipti was extremely brilliant and instant, which I have not experienced till date during these years of my service.I would find immense pleasure in finding the responses in my mail box.Brilliant.Keep up the good work.  
reaching tax advisors is very difficult  
IF POSSIBLE TRY TO FILE ITR FOR YOUR CLIENT ON THE BASIS OF 26 AS FORM AS FORM -16 GET ON FEW OCCASION.  
Great service, very economical pricing. CA was very co-operative.I wish if you guys could remind for the next year e-filing.  
very good job from Punita madam. Nicely explained all the points. Thanks a lot.  
The Tax advisor Ms. Dipti was very efficient and very responsive to complete the Tax returns on time. Thank you Ms. Dipti.  
It feel great to get unconditional assistance...superb work done H&R BLOCK team.  
Apart from salary when we start having stakes in more than one asset class and multiple geographies it only needs a Tax Expert like H&R to handle things. Being a Do-It-Yourself person and also having utilized other experts for the tax filing and planning purpose I can now definitely recommend H&R to everyone. They know what needs to be done and are the best in the business. Thanks for being around and keep up the good work.  
The quick responsiveness of HR&Block with your personalized service and professional tax expertise is definitely a benchmark in the Indian tax services (retail) segment.  
Easy to understand.....and file returned by self without hassle.....feeling Gr8 from last 2 years.....best wishes  
Timeliness, attention to detail, knowledge on complex tax matters  
We have received an excellent support and help from the tax Advisors. Very good process.  
The fees towards filing taxes are too high especially for people like us who live out of US. Charging >$320 for simple filing is way high. There is no complexity in my returns.Also the conversion rate rs. vs. $ used is also abnormal.But I appreciate the service of tax advisor.  
Amazing Service and well experienced professionals.Helped me a lot :D  
I would really thanks to Ritika for her excellent support and guidance.  
I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO EVERIFY MY FILLING ....I NEED TAX EXPERT TO GET BACK TO ME URGENTLY TODAY....I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO DO IT ONLINE ON THE WEB SITE....IT DOES NOT SEND THE MOBILE AND EMAIL PIN ON TIME.THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON SINCE LAST 7 DAYS AND I AM TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED.  
The Service was prompt and Hassle free. !!  
Yes this is very helpful  
.  
I am satisfied with the service provided Thank You  
H&R Block was very useful and easy for filing ITR.  
Simple, easy, reliable and timelines are respected & kept  
Easy to use website and prompt response from the advisors. Overall, a overall a great value for money and delightful experience.  
Actually the date due date was crossed, But I got call by Miss.Pooja & she advised me very nicely about my tax file.Thanks to her and H&R Block team for supporting.  
No Comments  
Service is really good.Advisor was very friendly and I got everything I need to do for saving my taxes. However please improve chat response service as I was not getting chat responses immediately and waited for 2-4 hours:(  
The updates what you put doesnt have date mentioned against it. You may add this feature. Example Tax calculation sheet uploaded but when? Date is missing. Tax calculation sheet is modified and updated-date is missing.Also on upload auto generated email alert is must like you send when there is a comment from tax expert.Both above suggestions if implemented will help to improve communication between client and you.  
Its really very helpful to save our time & money. extreme like & recommended to everyone.  
Very Professional approach. Quick turnaround.  
I'm extremely impressed by the Tax Expertise & the hassle free service.  
.  
Good  
Need more frequent interaction and advice for tax saving.  
Processing fee little higher ...maybe around 1500 it would be great . In terms of client interaction really good  
Need quick reply to phone call make by us.  
I never thought, tax filing could be so quick and efficient. The level of knowledge H&R representative had was impressive, she had all the answers on her fingertips. I spent just about 45 minutes in your office and my return was prepared and filed. You bring significant value for the individual tax payers. All the best.  
H&R Block is THE firm I am going to use for all of my tax matters. I have countless repeated experience with single person tax shops who promised to service me and were not capable of servicing my complex tax situations. Years lost, lots of money lost, thousands.Every time I consulted H&R Block, I got complete satisfaction. Many times, I was busy with work and couldn't attend the calls made by H&R consultant. They patiently called me back later and filed by tax for me before the deadline. The assurance I got from H&R each time is priceless. Charges are nominal too. Thanks a lot. I will talk to you next time!  
good  
I personally think your service is upto the mark in all aspect .I hope slowly you will capture bigger market share in India and small countries of Asia.  
Very quick and efficient service. Answered all my queries promptly. +1  
Keep up the good work  
Great work. I appreciate efforts for serving customers.  
NO Thanks.  
It would be very helpful, if you also undertake old refund cases which the our IT dept. has made very difficult to handle it by individuals.  
I loved your services , the Professional you people had send was amazing & very co-operative , I would love to work again to save my taxes with him just because of his humbleness & approach .. highly commendable .  
I worked with Roohi Rasheed from HR block, Banjara hills, hyderabad branch. Roohi was always available to help and assist with my taxes. With my extensive travel for work, I am very happy to have someone as reliable as Roohi to do my taxes and not worry about it. The way Roohi handled my tax returns, the professionalism and expertise she has provided was amazing!!  
I am impressed with the way my queries were handled and the process of tax return. It was so easy with the help of dedicated tax expert.  
Friendliness and personalized services  
Very user friendly website.Good support from Tax Expertise.  
Everyone wants to save tax, please guide the customer in that process.  
I had tried assisted online service and was very happy with the experience. So i reached out to their Bangalore office for a face to face discussion for a tax advisory service. I was pleasantly surprised to see pastel decor of the office and once again charmed by friendliness of staff. I am keen to know the secret sauce of staff's friendliness !!  
After e-filing, I physically submitted 3 signed copy of acknowledgement on August 31, 2015 on 6:00 pm at Pune H& R block office. I have yet not gotten any confirmation from IT department. I think your office lost my acknowledgement.  
Things I did not like1) Slow response, I have to wait for 2 days to get response from assign Tax expert.2) Accuracy issue, I have used hrblock service last year and current year both year i have problem with accuracy of computation with Interest earn from bank account. I had to work on bank statement myself to give interest statement both times to correct error.I will not use next year and won't recommend.  
The last step is print the doc and send to your office, can you kindly change this process to make it something online, like to take a print of return form then sign and upload to your website in order to reduce courier burden. Then if you need signed pages you can download from your website.  
i am very happy  
The service is exceptionally excellent by all means. The dedicated analyst , user friendly portal, responsiveness and approachability are noteworthy.  
I called may be more than 10 times but can not speak to my tax expert. response was very delay from you.  
Excellent Service. You have made the tax payer's e-filing work very easy.  
Simple and Effective . Great Job . Cheers !!  
The advisor aligned to me was proactive and knowledgeable. The H&R Block systems are a pleasure to work with. Excellent service.  
Tool and Service are both Great! Thanks for making our life easy.  
I have used other online tax services and appreciated the level of service and professionalism shown by your associates versus some of the others.  
Tax filing has never been this easy and convenient. Its very easy and got quick responses which saved lot of time. I really appreciate their work. Thank you H&R team  
Tax filing was made very easy .  
I was really happy by your service and recommendations.

Keep it up!! it is really easy filing tax through H & R Block  
really very helpful much appreciated  
For smooth process of filling Tax return.  
Tax advisors in H&R block is friendly and helpful in filing the tax return. Good Job!!!  
It was exactly what I was looking for, quick and easy.  
This is the second year I am using tax service from H&R Block. The professionalism and convenience they offer in filing taxes remotely is unparalleled.  
Keep it up.Extremely satisfied with the service.Thank you very much for your great cooperation.Expecting the same quality of service in future.  
The consultant assigned to us should have a direct contact or should be accessible to us over the phone numbers provided.  
Great assistance with tax formalities, which is convenient, easy and valuable. With the tax expertise from H&R Block, I can be sure that the regulations and processes are followed without deviation. I loved the service!  
Being a tax advisor we looks for your proactive advice.  
This year the fee charged (Rs 1000) was double of what I paid last year (Rs 500). This year's complexity of my tax situation is same as that of last year's, i.e. one Form 16, capital gain, loss from single house property, they are all same as last year's. About 10-20% increment in fees is acceptable but I did not expect a 100% hike. There are some specific information from my last-year's return that I expected to be automatically reflected in this year's return, but they were not. I had to inspect every little detail and then request for correction. E.g.1. Share of property between co-owners (90:10).2. Capital loss carried forward.3. Address of owned property.  
The tax adviser spend enough time to work on the tax. I'm happy with the tax advise which helped me get most tax benefit by having a series of discussions.  
Keep up the good work, you all doing good work.  
Found your charges high. I knew that it would be more than reasonable considering the overall service but much more to exceed my expectation. :-)  
no  
In my recent transactions I was facing many difficulties in uploading the required file. Hope for the advance technology.  
the advisor was very prompt and supportive.  
Thank you for your reminders. They sure help!  
good  
Quick and prompt communication. This delighted me a lot. Best part you know what you are doing. Keep up the good work.  
H&R block is simply superb  
Good service and I shock when I charge zero rupees for individual service.Since last year I am member of this free serviceKeep it up.  
Excellent service and very quick response  
please note that we need more advice on tax savings.  
Overall it was excellent service from H&R block. I was delighted most by the dedicated tax consultant and facility to contact him directly. I only had an instance where the tax consultant had to correct his tax summary. Barring that, the experience has been awesome. Self Service Portal is a big boon for people who are new to the process.  
Cont.... to Keep the gud work done..  
I am delighted to receive this fast service. It is saved my time. I am thankful to H & R Block team  
It was a very smooth and quick service. The consultant was patient to listen to all queries and support accordingly. I had a very good experience with H&R Block. Thank you.  
Sameer was my Tax Expert, he is fantastic in his work. Salute to his knowledge and his client oriented solutions are exemplary for many.  
Communication. Need lot of improvement, Everytime when I write mail I need to wait long enough and finally make a call to discuss anything.If call was not answered then i don't get any call back , I need to keep trying until I can get advisor on phone.  
hassle free experience  
I have received wonderful service from HR Block for my tax returns this year. Well appreciate it and not worrying about it for the next year, with confidence in HR Block to continue to the wonderful service.  
Imran was really helpful in doing all the last minute leg work - despite giving the request for tax filing on the last day. He was looking beyond the basic data available to identify venues of tax returns. He worked late hours and i would highly recommend his service for others.  
Appreciate timeliness.  
I am very happy the way H&R Block take up my request and fulfill it. Every thing was so perfect and smooth.  
Excellent service  
good service  
Friendly Tax advisors and good technology platform to connect and keep the information / transaction secure.Would have been good to get some advise for tax savings as well.Tried such service for the first time and was not disappointed!  
you should provide the direct contact details to reach out to the tax advisors directly within a second as of now i had contacted twice between last month but still not connected with the advisor  
Despite submitting the document, no one contacted me... When I asked for update, then only the team came in picture... I believe it should be proactive  
Very delighted with the service provided by the team!! Keep it up!!  
Service of Tax advisor was very prompt and satisfactory.  
Excelent  
Promptness, attentiveness, competence. You have excelled on all three counts. This for me is a personal benchmark that other service providers will be hard pressed to surpass. Keep up the great work.  
all are best team work  
Very User Friendly

Excellent  
Great service in terms of quick and quality response by H&R Block India  
Your service is really good and the prompt response is awesome.  
Tax saving inputs.  
Excellent.  
Seems, that tax executives at H&R block are not having enough experience of the same filed.They almost took one and half month for my ITR and that too on last day of extended date.For my case almost 4 advisers were changed and the response was not up to the mark.  
One of best services to file taxes in India. Affordable for anyone and worth it. For regular people its free.  
VERY NICE SERVICES THANK YOU  
Very fast.Accurate. No fuss.  
Really very speedy and personalise too...  
Support & Process for Filing of E-return was so easy & friendly with your help. keep it up !  
Na  
Keep up the good work......  
Keep up the good job  
We come to H & R block because you advertise and send emails asking us to take your assistance. Please train your agents to not yell at us when we follow up when you missed to get back to us with your promised call back. If you don't want to assist, you can politely say the same as there are many out there who can help us. Very rude and frustrated way of talking on the call. However in the end job was done so good Job.  
Really helpful for a person not familiar with Tax filing and IT return  
I really liked the way the process went. The service was professional and well managed. Thanks.  
H&R Block is just amazing. Its service is much instant than noddles.....  
On time support within a less time with more accuracy.Thanks a ton!!  
NA  
Excellent services  
excellent service  
Communication aspect being from overseas ( on part of NRI customer, like me ) it is very important to delegate responsibility to one tax adviser.Expert staff are your human asset, satisfaction on part of customer will not only lead to repeat services but open room for more improvements.  
Best example of "Digital Revolution"  
Its very good facility provided by you and very quick response.  
Felt very comfortable interacting with Priyanka and other staff at H&R Block. The intricacies of the tax laws that applied to my tax status were very well explained. The fees were very reasonable. I expect to stay with H&R Block for future tax filing purposes.  
We require time to time small investment advice which are valuable to save tax, ie any new banking product/insurance etc.,  
For premium and loyal cutomers, tax advise need to be provided by senior expert than conventionl entry level advisors.ThanksShailendra  
Good Service  
Awesome service, very quick and timely inputs from the tax experts.  
My advice is pay full payment for the bills submitted as per his/her eligibility limit.  
Details what you updated in ITR V are incorrect.Please contact me on +91 9886749768  
No comments  
I appreciate the quick response from tax consultant to my queries raised. The clarifications provided on capital gain calculation was very useful. In future, it will help me in effective tax planning.  
Really it has been a Great help for me and for all who have benefited from this team  
We have been filing return through Madhuri in the last 2 years, just wanted to pen down this appreciation for her on the support and work she has done for our tax filing.A big thank you Vaibhav Sankla, Madhuri and HR block team.Cheers !!  
Tax service provided by H&R bloack are really very good. their followup and guidence to customer is at par. i will recommened their service to all .. Good job  
NA  
There is no doubt that your service is value for money. I would personally like to thank your entire team as I believe the great quality of service that you are providing is not a job of one man but instead is an outcome of every team member's dedication towards whatever role they play with perfection.  
Easy and quick  
Promptness of reply was commendable  
When I tried to call your tax advisors, hardly anyone is available on phone. We get a message saying that you will get a call back from our tax advisor but it hardly happens so. In the process, client is in dark about the progress of the tax return. Pl try to improve on this aspect. Otherwise, you are doing a great job!  
Keep up the good work  
you are doing great job... :-)  
It was a very good experience filing tax with H&R Block. I filed at the last moment still the response and service was very great. Awesome! It would be very helpful if you update your application to support multiple Form-16 upload and scanning the same.  
Great job from H& R Block. Tax Expert is very friendly and quick. I will refer this with all my friends. Thanks!  
Roohi Rasheed helped me file my taxes when I was really confused how to. She made the process really simple and all I had to do was follow her instructions. I'll definitely come back to H&R Block next year as well.  
Amazing Service.  
Support given by H&R Block advosor is really appreciable.  
The response was very fast, i will always like to approach H & R block for my IT returns process.  
Everything is perfect. Tax advisors are so friendly & helpful.  
H&R tax expert calculation is same as my calculation, need to show more expertise. I have ask him to work on the medical insurance and 80G, but nothing as come as advice or any questions asked to ponder information o for any reduction in tax legally  
As I had two form 16 this year so I was not sure to go about it. But H&R people made it look so easy and the response was very fast. I would recommend H&R block.  
This group is doing really a great job. Appreciate it.  
Keep up the good work.  
Great work.........  
I'm glad you'll made the tax filing experience so interactive & user friendly.  
pls speak and gv some advise  
It is an amazing service. H&R Block is really fast with zero complexities, great tax experts and personalize service. The entire process got completed within 5 minutes and then return was filed in a day of time after the formal preparation. I would like to thank H&R Block for their excellent service at very low cost - Dr. Vinay M R  
I liked the way HR Block filed my incomeTax and advised.Great Job!  
Very easy to complete. Helpful and friendly Tax Expert.  
The service is extremely good. Tax saving Advice area can be focused, as the discussion is not initiated by the Tax Advisor.  
For my wife it was a bit bummy with name been goofed while filling the IVR-V form....  
Personally, found the tax consultants behavior rude and in haste. Was impressed with idea of filing tax online with assistance, but the interface i.e. calling on landline atleast 5 - 8 times and just hearing waiting tone and then be able to connect to a rude tax consultant was extreme turn off. I asked about process of sending documents by mail to bangalore, and was give no satisfactory answers. Consultant - Anand  
Appreciable alertness of expert provided.  
god service, only suggestion, if the number of consultant attending to custome could be increased, i found them overloaded which was leading to delayed response  
Its excellent job by H&R Block team.  
Tax advisor is quite friendly and cooperative. I felt it is easier to file the return with the assistance of tax advisor.  
Please make use of your phones provided. Call as soon as you have something to tell instead of waiting for the end user to check their mails and your website. Also, it is you that has to ask whether I had any more submissions for tax savings to make like HRA, Travel, 80CC savings etc. I was not asked anything and the consultant actually prepared my returns statement without any of these and I had to ask that person to include this in it so that I could have more returns. Please work for the better of the end user and not just for your benefit.  
H&R block helped me in retriving 20% of my money back from the tax amount paid for last year. Due to your tax expertise, this got happened. I am so happy for your service.  
Excellent support from HR Blocks Team.  
I would recommend you H & R Block services for below reasons.1. They are extremely friendly and will follow up you till you complete tax process.2. They will explain you whole process at each and every step to maximise your savings.3. They are premium and Free :).  
Excellent service  
Very prompt service. Flawless processes. Could get my tax filed in a couple of hours.  
Good Service.  
I feel delay in response, may be it is due to facing many clients in a day.  
Good Service.  
I feel the promptness of Ms. Neha as my tax advisor was great and she helped in closing the matter immediately.  
Please give some description about how to fill the every field... (Ex or like comments). so we can easily understated what we can enter.  
I have been filing returns for years, and this time I did with H&R Block and it is smooth like never before.  
Very impressed by the service provided. Continuous follow up and timely advice. Personal attention given was amazing.Thank you.  
Good service. Keep it up.  
More indepth tax advise on how to pay less tax would help more.  
The tax advisors don't know the basic etiquettes of speaking to the customer on call...  
One Feed back, You should have a helpdesk service who can advise about tax saving scope.that would be better duering the year most likly in the month of Jan to Mar.Thanks.Real appreciable servise from HR & Block.Thanks again a Lot.  
Great job! I am delighted.

I filed taxes when i was in US, the services are very good there.When i heard about H&R services in India, i felt very happy and filed my taxes with the help of H&R, tax agents are very helpful and they responded very well.  
Speed was exceedingly important for me & You delivered on time . Ramesh , your tax experts was persisting & collaborative & communication flow was continuous which built trust & therefore the high rating to your service.  
It's good to rely on H&R block for tax computation , one can be sure to get required & correct return.  
Tejprakash was a fine advisor and friend and with his help, I was able to successfully complete the tax filing within time. It was a pleasant experience and the website is very easy to use and collaborate on.

Kindly update time to time information to your customers after filing the taxes.

Very good and quick services, always followed up with me and advise was good.  
Excellent and prompt service from you guys. Thanks a lot.  
I had two form-16s as I had worked in two organisations in the financial year. I was a bit worried about mis-calculating the tax myself. H&R Block tax advisor made the work easy as she calculated the difference in tax and provided the steps to complete the payment. There was a detailed document which helped in submitting the ITR-V electronically.  
Thank you for your efforts in making tax returns filing smooth and easy. Appreciate your timely service.  
I expect the tax advisor to talk before finalizing the e return  
Please keep this service for free if you can. It's very user friendly and it also filed my income tax on the income tax website within few hours of my paying the the net taxable amount.  
Thank you for providing Tax clear declaration.I suggest you to proceed with the same quality service.  
you dont have a chatting facilities and your concern reply after 24 person.if you ask again some query it will take another 24 hours. i wasted my lot of time but it was hardlya job of 5 minuts. you prepre tax calculation without understanding the details.if you are sturday close please inform to concern immediately.  
1. If HR block can advice some investment options to reduce tax burdens, it can be better value added service.  
It was a wonderful Experience  
Should provide better understanding and tax saving advice.  
Superb  
H&R Block website is very user friendly. Kaustubh was very nice on the call and he was very helpful.I will recommend H&R Block to all my friends and family member.  
Very happy with the service, the tools used and the personalized service  
Very good service and the tax advisors are really good and very responsive to the queries posed.  
Your service is really great  
Best Service ever. Would Recommend this to the corporate friends.  
Response was very quick and accurate and I liked the service.  
It was very simple, easy to use and very supportive Tax advisors, who helped me in filing the Tax. Surely  
This is one of the best Tax filing returns that I experienced this time. The team at H&R block ensured a quick filing since I filed it on 31st Aug and within no time, they reverted with the calculations and return was filed in no time. Wonderful experience.  
Very friendly and time saving. great help!  
I have always been worried abt filling taxes and have always asked others to do it for me. A friend recommend your company and I am so happy I choose u coz this was the 1st time I managed to file my taxes myself with ur help. It was an amazing experience. Simple. To the point and amazing response time. Loved it  
hrblock.in - best place to get tax experts and their advices  
Very great service  
very nice services  
Really awesome... Is it possible to refer for my family member who belongs to other organization.?  
gr8 work and keep it more confidential.  
Thank You Very Much  
Tax savings advice to be given to the employees, as we are totally technical and not the experts  
it's easy and perfect tool.  
Response of the H&R Block Tax Advisor was very good . He showed a keen, fact based approach and helped me file the return very quickly. I am happy that I tried H&R Block.  
Way of saving taxes.  
its a nice experience to file my returns from the comfort of my home. fully honest and transparent system any one can rely.  
This year , reaching out to tax advisor was painful . You have to call multiple time to get response .  
After complication of the file u should also confirm the individual that further what h had to do n how ,, what is pending n what is next step to take because every person is not so friendly with ITR N INTERNET services it's hard to understand all these steps for anyone who is first time user like m  
Thanks, it was an absolute delight interacting with Durgesh & the clarity with which he communicated. Would like to appreciate he going the extra mile to assist me with other query as well which was not his responsibility.  
This was a simple Do-it-yourself kind of thing for me. The response was too quick.  
Did not get proper home loan declaration assistance, would be delighted if Tax adviser can explain little more on home loan declaration/savings on interest etc  
None as of now.  
Very Good service and thanks a lot once again  
Your tax experts should initiate all possible advises to the customer regarding the how can he save the tax.  
good excellent keep it up  
excellent service.  
H&R block has made IT returns so easy that even a toddler can complete this task . The website is so user friendly and the animation has made IT returns filing a child's play . The Tax expert are easily available even though I had applied with no user fee . Appreciation indeed .Feedback - Once the form 16 along with other declarations is uploaded ,there should be a provision to update the declarations incase there is mistake earlier .  
This is the 2nd time I have availed your services and am extremely satisfied.  
The speed and simplicity was simply awesome.  
No specific comment.  
excellent service  
Tips to save tax should be highlighted on your page so people can take inputs from your page.  
I really like the way Mr. Tej Prakash has handled my case and suggested me the right advise for saving my tax and how to invest smartly.  
It was an excellent service offered  
I Thanks to Neha.  
TAX REFUND PROCEDURE SIMPLIFIED AND MADE TENSION FREE TO EMPLOYEES.  
First time I filled income tax returns using this block and I didn't thought it will be that much easy for me. I really want to thanks H&R Block Team and best wishes.  
Very good & efficient services.  
Very good service and most important, your team is rating the customer as their own family which is very nice.Great support, appreciated !!!  
I being abroad now and in need to submit returns for last year (while I was in India) H&R Block gave me the most tech friendly environment where I could file my taxes remotely. Moving forward, each year I will use H&R block as I will still have income in India for the interest I earn from m y fixed deposits back in India. I will recommend H&R block's service to all my friends and colleagues as well. Thanks for your support and keep up the quality and good work !!!  
sometimes i found the advisor is non-responsive, failed to contact many a time  
Hi, Very happy with the services. But i feel it would be better to have toll-free number to reach H&R representatives. As your service is reaching customers all over india so,its worth to have a toll free number.  
After we finished everything from our end, the consultant is suddenly unreachable. There is no response to messages or phone calls(which always said our consultant is unreachable and will get back to us). No communication whatsoever initiated from H&R Blocks side! Finally, we find out that the return was not even filed after trying other means of communications. A small sorry from your end could have gone a long way, but I guess your company is too big to honestly acknowledge a mishandled case.  
No  
Good and Personlised support. Customer delighted :)  
It has been the second time that I am filing my e returns with the help of H&R block. Hassle free experience and delighted to continue the same. Thanks once again  
services are good .  
Nice, smooth and efficient. HR Block are true professionals, nice dealing with them for my tax submissions.  
Team should guide us to save more and more tax and give the ways through which we can save our tax.  
overall experience is good.  
Tax filing not completed  
It is Very much helpful and the process of efiling the returns in your is very ease and hassle free when compared to other sites.Need to Improve in the area of Tax Expertise.  
I tried calling H&R Block on the number provided and each time it just said number is busy and I was unable to get in touch with my tax adviser  
Dear Sir/mam,First of all Thanks for giving me such a good service.But I advice you that pls explore some tax saving options to clients like us bcs what I felt is that by using HnR block, tax advisor facilitated me to fill form 16, form 26as, evc verification etc but they had not save tax.Pls treat this as a positive feedback.Regards,Maulik Patel  
its very useful to all tax paid employees to know what iswe paid what is we reimburse. I recommended to my friends to file the IT on every year through H&R block.once again thanks for great solution. And service providing byRamu.Krishnamoorthy  
No  
Awesome service, never been easier  
Option to integrate aadhar card  
Keep up the good Job  
.  
Service is very first.  
I interacted with many personnel, Nani, Sonali, etc, from H&R Block and my every experience has been so amazing. I can't believe that an organisation like this exist that has made my tax filing so easy!!!  
My sincere thanks to H&R Block tax advisory team - in fact you have a good set of team at your end.  
I am very thankful to H & R BLOCK  
Need to be more proactive rather than reactive during submissions. Advice needs to come rather then just transactional support.  
Awful experience and helpful to me in my last hour.  
good service  
Easiest way to file IT return  
You all are really doing good Job.  
It was super quick and did not make me feel hassled or worried at any point. Thank you.. you guys are the best..  
The Tax Advisors assisted and answered all our queries very patiently.  
free and hassle free!!  
The final tax advice can be made more simple and in a layman's language.  
Hi,I think our Tax adviser should address us all Possibilities ,which can help us in saving our Tax. Regards  
Very impressed. Fast service. All my queries very resolved in one day.  
Provided service is good.  
Since you know us, it will nice if you can proactively help us with tax savings.  
The service given by Sagar was really excellent and fast as there was very little time as i approached you very late.  
I continuously called for 5 days and every time the IVR said that my call will be connected to the tax advisor however the tax advisor was not available. I was told that tax advisor will contact me however I never received any call back. I had to wait for approximatly 5 days to let my tax advisor know about the HRA which needs to be considered. I believe the tax advisor should consider the HRA before preparing the calculation sheet. Finally I got the ITR filled by the H&R team.  
Tax Advicor need to be more experienced to handle queries more efficiently. Esp if there is a tax to be paid by customer tax advisor should be able to say why the customer have to pay where is the miss from the customer side.  
Kindly ask the customer about there convenient time to talk and then call up the customer it is very problem to us to get the details when we are in office  
I am pity impressed with the service because of timely support !!Very good support for working professionals for income tax filing.  
I never though of having such easy process to efile, which can never be this much easy without H&R  
Your tax expert failed to solve the queries.  
This is the simplest way of filing tax. Your support in filing income tax is greatly appreciated. Thank you so much...  
It took me hardly 10 minutes to submit IT returns. Explanation on Tax query is to the point. Thanks H&R BLOCK team :-).  
Good Service...Expertice in field.  
Hi Team, I am very happy with the friendliness of the tax expert (Imran) as he gave all the answers very carefully and in detail & calmly. However firsty when my tax summary was prepared it was not correct(not prepared by Imran initially) and was wrong and then i have to investigate that and then gave the feedback to Imran and he corrected the same hence my only concern is not everyone gives that much attention so it should be prepared more accuratly & carefully as effects of this are major. Also, you should provide some extra time for discussion for some tax beinift advices.Thanks  
My tax advisor Darshan did a very good job and was very professional. Overall, very good experience.  
Thanks for such a quick tax filed and submitting  
Team follow very constructive approach & channel of getting details to complete the Tax Submission on time.  
Thank you Madhuri..Excellent services.  
Good Service. Keep it up :)  
one of the best service I have received in my last 12 years of experience, and I wish if this kind of service can be provided at our Government office most of our problems will get resolved.  
Nothing Specific  
I never thought tax filing was so easy. It is really an amazing tool to file the returns with few clicks. I love the paperless approach!  
I like the promptness in serving the customer.  
The response was very fast. Please keep up the good job.  
I am very happy with the service provided...  
Very quick and efficient in response.  
Prompt and accurate service...Good one!!!  
V Good  
Great service guys. It made my ITR so hassle free. Thanks for the help. Looking forward for next year ITR :D  
Really good service, extremely quick and professional!!!  
It's better if you also provide the guidance for Tax saving  
This is the first I have used your services & experice is very good.  
You are doing a great job. There is nothing that I would suggest as your area for improvement (based on my experie.1. Your intimation to file my returns came in - much in advance.2. Your reminders kept coming at very regular intervals.3. Dedicated staff to handle my returns was excellent.4. The processing of my filing was very quick.5. I did a last moment filing - you handled that during my weekend.6. Altogether it was a really relaxed filing!Thank you!Joseph  
great assistance, should reduce the price for service  
Service provided is awesome. I personally thank Kaustubh for his extreme support in filing my IT. thanks for all and keep continue with the same rhythm of support and service  
I Like your timely assistance and I hope it would be continue for future...Thank you for your help and assistance..  
some clarification regarding the advance tax for service personal as the projected total income is not known.I had to pay interest of Rs about 1000/- rupees.AARTI  
Excellent service!  
Called on your number given to me but nobody called back to know the issue  
Excellent service  
I was expecting tax saving advice from H&R block.  
I was looking forward for more inputs on tax saving advice. Probably due to the efilling ben done on the last day this did not happen  
I really appreciate the promptness .  
Dear Sir, I am extremely thankful to Mr.Amar who was assigned to me as my tax cosultant. He was very much helpful. One most commendable thing about him is he never discouraged me till to the end although I have lot of problem with my 26AS. He deserves encourangement.Further, I am very happy with the H&R Block for the Customer oriented approach they have leaving behind the Call Centre approach which is ornamented with hifi english and meant for techie sabi people.  
I would highly recommend to all my friends. Thankyou for your service.  
can give clients ideas on how they can save more on taxes  
The speed in which it was handled  
Thank you for helping me filing the returns.  
H & R was more interested in collecting personal data of people than filing returns. In my specific case, the address of the house property was a key factor for H&R though it has no relevance since deductions are as per Form 16 and no further rebate /refund was to be claimed.  
I am very happy with the Quick turnaround of the Tax adviser.Very much appreciated.  
Yes would like to know how we can do tax savings based on the form 16 provided..So that we can plan our investments accordingly.  
As a NRI, I found the service is really helpful because I just have to provide the information (in whichever format I have) and the H&R Tax expert did the rest  
Excellent service with on time.  
My experience was phenomenal since I approached H&R on 30th August, 2015 last day, but I was provided instant support and guidance.  
When I upload my Form 16 then within 6 hours, my ITR was filed by H&R Block and also sent this on my Personnel Mail ID. Very Good Service.  
Flexible and accommodating. Work done in one visit  
THIS IS VERY GOOD. NO NEED OF GOING TO PAY THE TAX  
I like the service provided and the quick response to fill tax returns with out any hassle.  
It was a great help to me, really saved hard efforts and so is the time. Thank much. Kudos to the team. Nastrovia!  
Very happy with the overall process. There was a period when I delayed responding to some of your queries and there was no follow up on that. Would have appreciated if there was any. But, once I responded, I liked the way how quick it was taken up.  
N/A  
Thanks a Lot to Nutan ... I was able to file my tax on time  
The ease with which my IT return filing was done through H & R Block was magnificent. Will surely continue to use your services in future as well.

This was the first time i was filling my IT-R. With H&R Block assistance, i did it very easily and in a very personalized and friendly manner. IT-R filing was fun.  
I have filed first time my tax return and it was my great experience with H&R Block. Only thing is that what's the information which we have to provide as a tax payers to take more tax benefits.  
Unfortunately wasnt able to speak to anybody. I also had other queries which i mentioned in my chat  
I was impressed with the responsiveness of H&R Block tax experts. Despite we modifying our inputs many times, they were very patient to correct the calculations multiple time. Appreciate this very much.  
All the queries collated in one forum and absolutely free. Very nice application. Thanks!  
Very good response and service. Thank You  
may be teh detials which you take can be further refined as a customer i may not be knowing what details will be helpful for saving tax. Like old interest of housing loan to be continued further  
Service is too good!!! Tax filing made simple by H&R block...  
They're reliable and would recommend solutions, Well done team. Thanks  
It helped me to file in easiest and simplest way.  
Its very prompt service  
I am very much delightful to have excellent service of yours. Still I want you to provide some comments on how we can save still some tax before filing. If you recommendations are excellent we can proceed in self-assessment and lower the tax payment.  
Continue doing your good effort.. Thanks.  
Great experience as I could save more than Rs.15K due to H&R Block services.  
Good support to clients...keep it up !!!  
I really liked your service.Thanks for your promp response.  
This was one of the hassle free experience of filing ITR.I have seen lots of advertisment mail from HR Block in my mailbox but was in doubt if really this web based service can provide me customize service for file ITR 2 or 3 form apart form only reflecting my form 16 in ITR.But the experience was very pleasant and the personalised advice of adviser with her excellent expertise in term of saving tax & not forget to remind me even for Property Tax I paid are exempted in Income tax.Thanks.

H&R Block Tax Advisors very friendly, helpful and co-operative.Thanks  
I want to thank Madhuri, My tax advisor for her great work. It makes me H&R customer forever!!  
Nothing  
No  
neither feedback nor confirmation, whether the return has been filed yet or not. No response once discussed over phone.  
Keep up the good work.I liked the speedy reponse that you give the most.  
The whole process was very user friendly and helped me in saving lot of time. Thank You !!  
I am completely naive at filing IT return. I didn't got the guidance to save tax. My return was simply calculated where I had to pay some 4k to tax department. One I said that my HR component is not included and I have also made some other investments I got a return of 5k. This should happen from HR Block end and you should encourage and guide customers for saving tax. Otherwise the response time, support and filing service was just awesome.  
Nice Dealing  
Service provided was quick and excellent. I mean it.  
Although the service was very good but I had to call your number several times to get the response on the last day off filing. Since its a refund case it did not matter to me filing beyond the last date but I found complete non responsiveness on the last day.  
I am a salaried person with no extra income. All taxes were deducted from my salary by my employer. Our organisation SUD Life have made a tie up with you and hence our HR department had recommended your services. After sharing my FORM 16 with you which i have received from my organisation SUD Life (where in it is clearly reflecting that all investments / exemptions / deductions are taken into consideration there is NO further TAX to be paid); the person who prepared my tax return from your organisation prepared my tax return which where it was reflecting that i have to pay an additional tax of some 14000/- odd ruppes. I was very surprised by the fact that when the person have been provided information that here is a salaried person declaring no extra income and submitting Form 16; how come the calculations show that he have to pay additional taxes! Immediately the person should have checked for errors since it does not require any brain!When i checked and found out that during calculation, the "Interest component of my Home Loa EMI was not considered which was CLEARLY appearing in my Form 16"; i brought it to the notice of the concerned person (Purushottam) and he immediately did the needful.I felt that your organisation being TAX EXPERT, should not have committed such mistake.However, at the same time, i must appreciate the speed at which my case was taken up. I submitted my details on late evening of 30th August and the person concerned (in this case Purushottam) did it immediately in the late evening and informed me to check and revert so that the tax returns can be filed after my confirmation. Also, Purushottam always picked the phone whenever i called him to update and responded with a deadline and kept his committment. He not only filed my corrected tax returns within 31st August but also told me how i can check online the status of my tax return on the portal of income tax department. Purushottam was very courteous and immediately accepted the mistake and rectified it. So despite the mistake (which might have happened erroneously due the amount of work load during the last moment rush on the penultimate day), i have provided your company the rating of 7 and will recommend it to others. I have already told others that i am very impreseed with the speed and processes (confirmation mail, SMS, personalised service provider and so on....). Your organisation (which in my case was Purushottam) values committmemt, reflects empathy (as i was concerned whether my returns will be filed within timelines of 31st August) and very courteous.Thanks H&R BLOCK for the help.Regards,  
I tried to call the tax expert assigned to get more details on the further steps. Due to some reasons i could not get the call back and it bothered me.  
1. Very nice user friendly interface of the tool.2. Very helpful executives and zero effort from our side. 2. Quick turn around of any kind of query.  
Manasi did very good coordination. Overall satisfied with the H&R.  
No everything is fine.  
none  
keepup good work!!  
You have made easy way to claim IT Returns. It is too early to say anything about the service you have provided free of charge to the Sr Citizens & Women which I want to appreciate. I will give some more comments after the receipt of my Income Tax Returns. I want that, to let know everybody about this service which saves time while claiming IT Returns. This is the time people want to save the time & money.  
THIS WAS GOOD AND FAST . THIS INCREASES THE CONFIDANCE THAT WE CAN RELY ON YOUR SERVICES.  
no comment at this point of time  
As of now there is nothing... U ppl are good going... Immediate response... Keep it up... I recommend H&R Block to my friends n everyone...  
It was really good experience with you people  
na  
The user friendly , easy steps to file our tax returns and very usefull tool.  
I was delighted with the friendliness and ease of interacting with the tax experts to complete my ITR and tax filing within 5 to 10 minutes. The only thing is I had to try multiple times to reach my tax expert to get the attention, but once I got the attention, the whole process was a breeze.  
Your service portal is good. I like it because it's user friendly.  
Pls help us in future also  
Excellent service

every thing is ok  
No timely response to the messages,No reply to the phone call even once,wrong preparation of ITR  
I didnot got my FY-13&14 tax e filing status. also no one contacted me . but I mentioned to my tax advisor (FY-14-15) Mrs.Manjusha who`s dealing was very good. also she intimated to the past adviser. but still i didn`t got any reply regarding ....  
Your Follow ups are good but if i am contacting in the given phone no, i am not able to speak concerned executive directly.I can communicate through chat and via phone only when you are calling me.  
The website was very user friendly and the process of filing returns was quick and simple.

Properly and promptly approached for tax filing even we are availing free service through our company (Genpact)....Multiple reminders to review the tax return file (busy work schedule forgot to review myself immediately)...Really Happy to recommend the service to my friends....  
Great experience with H&R block service, its helpful & simplified process to use.  
Excellent experience  
This is one of the worst experience..Neither some one have called nor informed me about filing IT return..I have tried nearly 20 times, to pune number, never anyone have taken call nor got a call back. Moreover i have also called Hyderabad number and have spoken to one of your executive, he promised that i shall get call within half an hour, but its more than 48 hours ,none of them called back.I want to get clarification why the IT return have been filed on 1st sep when 31st was last date, and moreover without my concern why IT return have filed..I am expecting a call and reversal of my IT return, else shall take action this for sure.  
Easy steps for uploading data....."Happy to help" nature of the tax advisor  
Simplified Site,recommended  
NA  
Need comfort on the confidentiality maintained with the data as these are very sensitive personal data. I logged in through ICICI direct and was redirected to H&R. Normally on entering a new site privacy related terms are shared before proceeding further. This was missing unless the exact terms as signed off with ICICI are applicable for H&R also.  
I was expecting some suggestions from your side to save more tax in this year and plan to save for next year.  
System is easy to handle  
I approached H & R at the last moment. Thank you for your immediate service. Your Tax expert "Manoj" was good and was really helpful.  
Information available with ICICI should be taken automatically & only which isn't with ICICI should be asked.Thanks.  
Be patient n understand the customer request. U r the tax expert im not!  
It would be great if all the additional information/ documents required in a particular case be spelled at once. This would help in closure of transaction faster. Any personalized advice for tax saving shall be helpful.  
I am extremely happy with the service rendered by H&R BLOCK.I filed my Income Tax Return at the eleventh hour in a hurry and H&R team guided me with great care. As soon as I applied, my application was assigned with concerned adviser.Within a couple of days my ITR V was generated. Really excellent !!! My heartiest greetings to H&R team for the wonderful service.  
Excellent service and help was done on time to submit my tax returns on time  
Keep up the good work .I have referred one person. Seems she is also happy too with your services. way to go..  
Best service and commitment  
I call was not recieve by my tax adviser and also taxes that I pay was not refund  
As of now no comment  
Rujal is very helpful and prompt. I contacted H&R on the last day of tax filing deadline and received immediate help.  
Good work  
No issue about service  
Excellent quality of service being maintained by your team, Simply superb, Keep it up !!!!Extremely satisfied  
Thanks for your support.  
Very Prompt Service. My call was attended immediately. My returns was filed promptly.  
Good support from the tax advisor.  
I have made my tax payment on 31st which was last day .. H&R block filed my ITR at night and i am very happy with the service  
It's not easy to connect with Tax Experts. Lines are always busy.  
Put a demo block of filling the tax to your site.  
Hello,Its a wonderful experience to work together, And my sincere thanks to Dipti on wonderful job done as a tax advisor by guiding me through with patience and consistent follow-up. I would recommend to my friends and family to avail a hassle free assistant.  
your advisors are friendly..no doubt abt it but one is not able to connect to your advisors. The only way to reach out to them is through message on your site. Call never gets connected to your tax advisor.Suggestion: Your tax advisors must me more approachable.Rest all is good. It was a pretty smooth process through your tax advisors otherwise.  
Extremely user friendly specially with out any return or rewadsNOT PART OF COMMENTI had common mob with my husband not able to contact my tax advice, my IT Return still pending Pl tell some to contact meI have allreay reccomended to my dear ones who are in USA and Kenia  
The tax advisor called and clarified the calculations even on a Sunday and followed-up till I end-to-end process is complete.  
I am extremely satisfied with H&R Block services, particularly of Mr Juber. He called At times Voice Assisted Automated system for transferring to Tax Adviser does not work and always says that "your tax adviser is un-available". This is quite frustrating at the time of urgency. There has to be very active, sensible and polite Client Service Desk to handle urgency and that option has to be available in the Voice Guided System.  
Simply Superb I have done with ease simple steps.  
Fee/Charge/Price is much on the higher side. Should reduce. You should also send discount offers to existing customers each year. Else, you will lose customers. I paid more than Rs.1100 this year which is on the higher side compared to your competitors.  
I was trying to file my income tax in the last day!! H&R Block is able to assist me quickly and file my returns on time. Thumbs Up!!  
please include some hindi speaking fellows in your team.This will help you and many people  
We expect complete tax saving consultancy.  
Sincerity.  
This is very first time that I get services from your side and really it is Excellent.  
quick response and service.very good.  
Your service is very much satisfactory and I would like to take your help in tax filling and other services in the future cycles too.  
Keep up the good work  
Tax saving advise i receive is also very useful  
It's was my first assignment with H&R Block and I really thanks to Aniket who not support me but guide and was in contact with me till end of process. Really appreciated...  
Superb services. I am extremely delighted with hassle free ITR filing process offered by H&R Block team. Big thanks to entire team.  
I would like to appreciate the efforts Deepak has put in helping me understanding each and every calculation and details about my tax return. He has been very supportive and I am sure that he holds remarkable knowledge about the ITR. He has been confident and holds good communication skills. I am very happy with the help and support I got from H&R block. Deepak is really an asset for your team.  
Very happy with the work done by HR blockAlways SWIFT resoponse till the task completed  
Very friendly and good service  
Your service was Flawless and speedy.  
It was a nice experience which had with my tax advisor.If possible an update on mobile might be of added advantage..  
Tax experts were not reachable over phone most of the time.  
Speedy and hassle free way of tax filing. Recommended.  
I received an email saying your ITR-V has been sent to your email ID but so far I have not received it.  
The advise that I have recd. for some adjustments was one thing amoong other that I wish to appreciate. Also I wish to appreciate tax expert's promptness and courtesy.  
I realy like your services and for the ontime response.Thank you  
Super easy & clean interface ; almost no clutter & overselling!I liked the fact that Q&A covers most items people would be confused about (capital gains, 2 houses etc)Suggestion for improvement would be to include links to pay additional taxes & that returns us back to H&R block with receipt of any additional tax paid.Another suggestion is to change color of "back" buttons - in low light conditions, it is hardly visible!  
It was very good experience from MyUniverse web site for filling my tax, Thanks a lot.  
Simple & Quick - One of the best online tax returns filing services so far...amazing personalized after service as well.  
It was easy for us,........ u made it very easy. tq

I am extremely happy with the fantastic service given by H & R Block's personnel. I have interacted with them over the last 2 years to file my returns and have found the experience extremely user friendly, quick and accurate. I would strongly appeal to everyone to get in touch with them with your needs, if you are looking for some entity to help you with your IT returns ( for those who have already used their services, they need no nudging, as I'm sure they will never go to anyone else, ever.  
A wonderful serve, God Bless.  
Responsiveness. I did not know if my returns were file don the last day. My messages were not answered. I even tried filing through someone else late in the night because I had no response form your end. But next day I realized that the returns were filed. If it had been communicated to me on time, I would have been spared that last minute confusion.  
Good service.  
Quickest tax filing experience.  
The service received was prompt and efficient. The response received at each stage, beginning from the enrolling to the ITR-Verification, via text messages and mail were quick. Will definitely recommend you to friends and colleagues.Great Service. Thanks.  
Very helpful!Thank you so much :)  
I liked the initiative which you have taken for completing the whole activity.  
Really Impressive. I have been using a CA for the last 10-12 years,and this was the first time, I went online and realised, your experience and professionalism, backed by processes was just too good . . I just hope you keep up your performance !!!Regards

No comments  
Keep it up! Very smooth and customer friendly process.  
I was surprised by the fact that the advisors took this much time as well as called me directly for every query especially when I am not paying for your services.  
The entire process is very fast, simple and easy. It takes only few minutes. Good to have an online consultant like you.  
Highly glad with prompt and personalised approach.Keep up good work.  
Service was unexpectedly awesome, Would love to be served again.  
thanks for providing info at the earliest possible  
Most of time if it is free service or promotion the ITR prepared is more like an automated sheet created. Need to see if tax advice can be provided instead of just relying on the doc we are submitting and filing the same  
Thanks ! Great Service.  
It is very helpful for me thank you.  
The friendliness and instant feedback were the highlight of the service I received. I was delighted by the fact that there was a dedicated person working for me free of cost. Big thanks to Mr. Sameer and H&R Block team.  
This was my first interaction with H&R Block Tax Advisors. I was very happy with your prompt and excellent service....thank you very much. Really appreciate it.

ok  
Very good service, fast and prompt response to queries. Whole tax filing process was hassle free.  
1. Excellent user-interface2. Simple and easy to use 1-2-3 steps3. Friendly and accessible tax experts4. Excellent value-for-money5. Brilliant tele-service.  
May be you should have a Chat option  
Very good and ease  
Service received from your group is excellent.  
Support in filing the return, step by step guidance and knowledge of advisor was excellent.  
Quick reponse delighted me  
I liked the prompt and personalized service and continuous 'keeping in touch' till the filing was done  
Tax Saving Advice Details Required  
It was really awesome to have your services. Really good that your associate voluntarily picked up the track from my PAN and advised me better  
Information provided entered in a timely and professional manner. Reply was prompt on any queries.  
Very prompt response.  
Excellent!  
The entire experience from self assessment, e filing and finally to validation was a thoroughly professional job. The chat with tax expert was helpful in clearing doubts.  
NA  
One of the best online services.The best part is they assign a single point of contact for your tax filing.  
Nothing  
Thank you very much appreciate all your help. You guys are very cordial and nice.  
Smoothly processed my tax filling with quick and efficient responses. Highly recommend the services....  
My file was handled by Ramesh, I called him many time during submitting my file. He explained me each and every step. Thank u so much Ramesh..  
This service is very good. We can even discuss various queries with the dedicated tax advisors assigned to us. Thank you H&R block. May we get this service every year.  
Hema the tax advisor was awesome, before I could start thinking she helped me with alternate options. I just loved the assistance. U should hire more ppl like her. I am delighted with the services I got.  
Thank you for all your support, This interaction was related to Tax filing, I felt response is quite slow and too much time goes into follow ups. Please make sure some response comes immediately. And filing is done quickly. Since Income tax site improved lot others looks like redundant. Once has to better competitive in such scenario.  
I like the service offered by you guys. Do keep up the good work.  
good overall support .  
The communication need an immediate attention. I had a paid engagement with them but the communication was very poor. Until I reach out to them there was no update. Which is the case for the entire engagement period. Not the service one would expect for a paid engagement.  
I am really delight with HR block service. They ont only filling my IT returns but make me update & aware about tax rules in minute level also.  
Please Suggest all tax saving advice  
Good Service. Can include feature like Instant Chat with Tax Advisors. Each time we have to post a message and then wait for 24 hours for his reply. We are getting reply within 24 hours so no complains about that but still if we can instantly chat with the Advisor then the process of tax filing will be more quicker.  
The Tax Advisor along with the customer care were pretty much helpful. Would definately come back next year also.  
Everything is perfect . Like the fast responses to any query . The process on how to delight the customer was taken care of .  
The process was very quick and efficient and am very happy with the kind of service you'll provided me  
Impressed with personalized service & quick response. Thank you  
I like the chat comments part where I use to ask my query and get answers promptly.  
continious perseverance & reminder for filing from you was amazing. in busy life the efforts are really appreciated.only request is if tax saving advice is given it will be more beneficial.  
Its a nice effort by H&R Block. Income tax filing was very quick. Tax advisors are extremely friendly and knowledgeable. Extremely happy with the service.  
I am really happy with services given by you. I wish a grat success ahead for H & R Block organization.  
Would be good if we can get the details of tax return file in messege too, just the brieft description.  
The representative was knowledgeable, pleasing and friendly person and wanting to help. However, whether due to work load or otherwise, I had to follow it up with him.Also, even when information had been provided, either by entering on the site, or through upload, it was not getting registered and requests were made to re-provide the same. However, once explained, it was not necessary.There is still huge scope for a seamless experience.  
When ask query they helped me to solve my issue.  
Good Site for IT Return filing.  
i got stuck as i had 3 form 16, but HR block made it easy  
Filing tax return was never so easy , thanks H&R Block team for a wonderful experience.Recomended your services to my friends , they are also now using H&R .Keep up the great work .  
H&R Block is the most simplest and easiest service available on the net, whatever complicated your Tax situation may be !! Some mouse click and bingo ... its all done. Plus the adviser calls you up and confirms. I am availing their services for two years on a row and I am delighted. So much of headache has been taken care of by H&R Block. Thanks  
Extremely glad with your support. I would like to have some advice on how to make investments for Tax Savings in the Financial Year 15-16.Could you kindly help.  
Thanks Deepak for such a quick action in Filing my Tax. Appreciate your help.  
Tax filing was very easy with quick updates on every step in the process. It was indeed a smooth experience when compared to filing the returns on the govt website  
All of the above listed items are very important but i felt very comfortable bcoz of the personalized service and the quick turn around was also very helpful  
Filing tax with H&R BLOCK was a breeze. I could finish it in less than 5 minutes. Easy user interface and personalized service. Great work team!  
The ease of use of the website and process on the whole. UI does make a great difference. Kudos to your User-Experience Team, brilliant job done. User Experience is very good.  
Pretty cool service. Prachi, my Tax advisor was immediately available for help and quite prompt in replies.  
Tax Advisor Jagdish was very helpful and demonstrated great customer service and tax advisory skills!  
You made tax filing a very easy job to do now. Thanks .. keep it up.  
Awesome service. Very proactive!!  
H&R Block India is great that takes care of all your tax calculations.  
Very prompt and fast service.  
I did not receive any call from your advisor or any advise even though I was told that it would happen. only reason for giving good recommendation was due to friendly portal.  
I really liked your e-Filing tool and the workflow. The tax filing process was transparent and seamless. I would like to be an H & R customer in the years to come !  
if website is more descriptive about the process.  
Just one update from my end - the ITR file has to get downloaded in a much easier way  
Very easy and convenient to file the tax return.  
Tax Advisor's way of helping us is vary good they always approach us with out any irritation and respond quickly.I am vary happy with H&R and will also tell to my friends to reach out to H&R for any related issue.  
Really Helpfull and Time Saving. Recommend all to go for!  
Thanks for the timely help.  
This year I had one of the worst experience in filing my tax through your portal. It was most difficult to get in touch with the tax adviser with the automated system repeatedly saying 'your tax adviser is not available'. I just do not understand how you guys assume that your clients have enough and more time to keep calling your number multiple times a day just to clarify a doubt with your tax adviser. Secondly, your assumption that your clients will keep logging into your website to check the messages that the tax adviser has left behind is completely out of place. It will be much easier for me to pay the kirana CA INR 1000 and get my tax filed within minutes.  
Good work keep it  
Tax Filing at your finger tips.  
NA  
Professionals! Yes, that's describe H&R Block. Very helpful and filed my return in less than 24 hours. Brilliant work guys!  
Response and resolution time was very fast.  
Yes, kindly having a live person to receive the calls when we are trying to reach you guys in person as everytime we call IVR plays the same message.Please show my Nmae is either Anannya or Anannya V Meishri  
thank you :)  
The fee 1136 Rs charged for filing returns that involve capital gains, isn't justified. Please make it a bit reasonable at least for corporate people.  
Very Good  
Excellent services.But we hope as all the information provided by us should be strictly confidential & cann't to shared or miss-used by anyone at any cost.  
I like it , this is very helpful for mr  
it would have been good if my advisor came in person to office to help me.  
This is good IBM HR initiative  
They need to call & ask the problem to customer & not just send emails. Also my return filing is completed but I have note received a copy which I need to send to IT department.  
Ii was great experience with H&R. Very fast, secure and time saver. I really want to thanks to all your team member.  
Your services are prompt and good. What is your fee if we recommend to a friend or any relative. I also want to take help to file return of my family members. Please let me know the process. Once again thanks for your services and support.  
Very fast service.  
It was a great experience .  
It is simply superb. Every aspect of satisfaction to the customer is taken care of.  
it would be good to provide mobile numbers instead of landline because sometimes its difficult to contact  
I'm happy with the response of the Tax Advisor.  
After I used H&R Block, I advised my wife for this & she too used it. The response is very good. When it comes to personal details, I was surprised to find out that the tax advisors go to IncomeTax PAN page & verify the details. That increased the confidence since it gave me a feeling the advisors are serious in doing a neat work.  
I got to know i have to pay additoinal Tax after computation.but i was not provided details as to why or on what basis.when called up didnt get proper response from other side!  
Yes, most of the time the employees might not be aware of TAX slab and other TAX related details, it would beneficial if there is a process to make everyone aware about the TAX saving plans in advance.  
Thank you for your support  
.  
Amazing Experience from last 2 times. Quick responses from the agents assigned to us, they even call and clarify matters asap. Great service !  
Your landline number is hard to reach. Rest is fine.  
it will be good, if we can have more conversation and your tax experts explains the way he computed. Also he can probe more further by asking about investments, contributions, income etc. which will give us a hope that he covered all areas and we will not have trouble later.  
Excellent Service! Thank you!  
If you cloud advice the customers on more tax savings would be helpful, however I had a very good experience with H&R Block people. They helped a lot to e-file of my ITR.  
The process is very simple to collect all the details required for filing the returns. The user interface looks very good and is clear. Connecting to the tax expert assigned to us was very good, without lots of waiting.  
NA  
The replies are not prompt may be coz of may lots of clients coming on your site.  
excellent work  
Experienced faster help in submitting eFile, Tax Expertise are awesome. Thanks  
Simplicity of process.  
thanks for you did this tax service.  
Its a very smooth experience of filing ITR with H & R block. I would like to say a word of thank to the Team behind it.  
should give mobile number, v.tough to reach on landline and experts don't call back  
For Queries , Idin't get replies, as well as I was not able to contact assigned Tax payer when I called them.  
i can say this is the best use of digitalization, i filed my tax within 4 minut. Great..Thanks to H&R Block.  
Response time can be increased; Overall best service experience.  
We request you to consider providing tax planning also, which will be very useful to all the individuals like me who are not big enough to hire a tax adviser and busy to research on our own.  
Its truly helpfull that I got personalised services related to my tax saving.thanks to husna mam.  
There is a Big issue in reaching out to H & R Bloack , the landline number mostly gives a message your tax advisor is unavailable at the moment. This continued for 3-4 days then after dropping a mail to H & R Block team the same number was given even when the mail sent was Urgent. Somehow got to reach on the landline number and intimated the Team about the service reqd. Any number which can accessible should be provided, the customer should not get irritated trying the number making it a Daily routine.  
Hi,Even after calling couple of times to Varganti to NOT to submit my E-Filling, but he already E-Filled. Now I don't know how to rollback and resubmit E-filling once again.Regards,Prakash Madarla  
Excellent and easy way to make the filling in this information age.  
You should proactively recommend financial planning basis the data that you have, I am not referring to pitching policies etc but better financial planning tools  
I had used some other sources in past for filing the tax but I liked the ease while filing through tax with H&R.  
Its good experiance.  
No one revert from your side , i recived a sms that fatima will shortly contact with u regarding your query till date no one contact or call me .  
I am greatly impressed with the promptness of your executives regarding any financial query. Definitely a hassle free experience with H&R Block. Keep up the great work :)  
timely reply on clients mail and contact in TAT as shown in your site.  
good work..!!  
HelloI would like to thank H&R Block Team. They are experts in their respective area and capable enough to assist us remotely. They made my life easy in terms of filing the returns. Wish you good luck.Thanks  
I was asked to send the document to Bangalore directly, as other companies get the ITRV signed by individual and they send it to Bangalore, this needs to be taken care  
its really helpful and your advisor's are really good  
I used it for the first time and liked your service a lot. It was more of a personalized Service to me.  
Good Job It was my first experience with H&R  
In time serviceExcellent expertise to understand the client's painful area.  
My TAX consultant 'Prasad Patil' was very helpful and guided me very well to achieve the goal. He constantly followed up with me to get it done before the last date.  
Overall a great experience. Thank you very much...!!!  
The overall experience was great , the responsiveness of website and prompt e-communications were commendable. However during the last few days I observed the web portal was not auto reading the form 16 once uploaded . Also call back from the Tax expert was missing once requested  
Good Response  
My experience at your site was very good. I see this as a great name in future. I recommended it to a lot of friends and everyone i know was in praise with your system  
H&R Block has provided one of the most convenient and easy solution to file ITR..A big Thank You..!!  
None  
The lady was prompt and professional. There was a little delay in the communication but that can be avoided as she used the message tab to communicate the information required for successful e-filing.  
Whenever I called the customer care number provided, it says it is redirecting to tax expert but nobody ever answered it.  
I am really thankful to the service which I received from H&R block. It is truly professional and the expertise is really helpful to the working employees like me. Thank you!  
Yes.First of all thanks a lot for all the such beautiful site and the valuable feedback we received timely from the tax experties.Special thanks to Manjusha my tax experties and advisor, for her guidance , valuable suggestion and prompt service.It's really overall worth experience.Thanks with regards,Kiran pokharkar.  
Very Professional and approachable..  
Very easy and convenient to file return, would recommend to others too.  
The person handling my case(Kaustubh Deshpande) was very helpful and also made sure that he answers all my queries and made me feel that "He is there to take care of my queries and concerns"-Thank you Kaustubh  
Nothing much. but appriciate your services which you provided the response very quickly.  
I truly liked the idea, and the quick response, and the professional way they handled my ITR. It was quick and easy, hasslefree  
good  
How we can discuss the tax relates issue in telephonic.the land line no we not receive the renponse  
Your software is simple and amazing. In the recent times i have not come across such excellent personalized and prompt services. Good work and keep it up. Your tax consultants are smart and easily approachable.I would prefer if you can add value added services like - pay income tax if additional payment is required etc.  
Thanks for such friendly service.  
Great going people! You guys are making the ITR filing work seem so easy for the busy junta. Thank you for the great support!! Your team deserves a big hi-5!!  
Please extend your inperson support in Chennai.  
Thanks  
-  
It is very easy and time saving.  
overall good service, but in my case after generating query correct the tax, it should be done at first go only. Yes but responce is postive and timely which appreciate...  
Wonderfull Job!!! keep it up guys  
Good  
I feel they are not taking the time to understand the tax needs and suggest ways a customer can save money. For example I got Rs 2 lakh as rent for my rental property, but I also had maintainance on it. He did not ask about it. So I lost an opportunity to save money there.  
The Services are extremely punctual  
I really liked the quick turn around of your tax experts on my queries however there is a minor miscommunication when I enquired whether the interest received on RD is taxable. One of your tax experts said it is taxable and the other person said it is not taxable as it is within 10000 limit. I understand only the interest earned on Savings account is tax free within 10000 limit. Interest earned on RD/FD is taxable.  
VERY QUICK RESPONSE...  
Rahul was very proactive with regular update, through calls and email.. cheers  
You save our time provide good plateform for working professional and your expert support was very good and our confidence level increase to rely on you  
hassle free, timely completion, prompt advices and what else.great support received. thanks...  
I was really appreciative of the fact that I could speak directly with the person who prepared my returns and that she was knowledgeable enough to clear my doubts really quickly.  
It made my thing so smooth for me. Thanks H&R Block!  
You started well.. Now let's see if you maintain or not! For this same service I don't mind paying.

Excellent  
efiling of income tax rrturn made unimaginably easy thanks a lot  
Service were provided within the stipulate time period. Very professional approach followed for all queries.  
Great and swift service. Highly recommended for all the Tax payers  
Customer service is very very poor, need to improve a lot.your so called tax experts are too poor in soft skills.Their comments to clients are "Listen..This is free service, if you want take it..take or go somewhere else" is the high of stupidity.  
I also prefer more than sending messages over the portal it is better we have a communication open as it will give the clarity over the phone once we have submitted the request .. one of my suggestion  
I really appreciate your Tax advisors  
It was very easy and friendly tool of yours all i need to do is enter the details (correct information) and rest all is taken care of by you. I am happy that this time our company took help of H&R Block for online tax submission.I appreciate your work and the way you deal with customers. You can add my name to the list of your Happy Customers :)  
good  
Also Our Tax Expertise  
Extremely convenient to use the service. Thank you!  
I had not initially uploaded Form A, but the tax advisor did not find that out. It would be great to have someone giving the tax saving advice. Otherwise you guys are doing a great job already! Thank you for being so prompt.  
I was pleasantly surprised with the speed and agility of your consultants.  
This is amazingly simplified and Mansi, my advisor was too good !!!  
Great Service ever seen.. Kudos for you...  
Good expertise, professional behaviour and very prompt. Looking forward to working with you guys next year!  
Good service with expert people. Thanks  
its better if you could provide some advice a month before on savings of tax, if you do this you could save tax etc. then it will be sweet dish  
Excellent service - Thank you !  
Really good service  
Very much fascinated with the services provided by H&R Block. Their Tax Advisors are very friendly and give time.  
Yes. I observed that there were some errors made while calculating my tax. And understood from other person that the same thing happened to them with H&R. It was corrected only after I informed. This can be avoided so the experience would be better.  
The sevice is fast and prompt.  
Great Service! High precision and wonderful followup:)  
Every thing is excellence in service level..... keep it up..!!!  
It was a very fast service as the deadline was approaching. Liked the way, the entire experience of dealing with your executives.  
I had call twice to know the status and next action/step  
Website structure.  
IT IS GOOD SERVICE GIVEN BY H&R BLOCK ALSO FAST ACTION TAKEN BY TAX EXPERT. THANKS.  
I appreciate the user friendly interface and fast response from the H&R Block system which helped me file my ITR quickly and smoothly.  
I had a great experience filing my IT Return with H&R Block, the dedication of the Tax Consultant surprised me. I uploaded my docs on a Saturday evening and I got a call within half an hour, and I filed my return by Monday.Thank you very much....  
Nil  
I would request the advisers to follow up with their client/consultants until it is completely processed ie i mean until ITR is submitted online and get the acknowledgment with the help of EVC code.  
Overall Feedback is very satisfied.  
Excellent service. Very patient executives. Hats Off to H&R Block.  
no  
The ITR-V copy I received in my e-mail was in zip file incompatible to my mobile. Kindly send in pdf format for more convenience.  
Absolutely hassle free and extremely user friendly!! Just loved it  
H&R block made my life easy to pay my taxes timely and accurately.  
All is well in your process and I should say great experience for me !  
Good job guys. It is really very easy to use. Only 5-10 Mins were required to file my Tax return :)  
Availability of tax advisor per my convenient time really helped file my IT on time.  
Not really  
Very Quick and responsive  
Provide more space to add files.  
The services provided by H&R Block was outstanding and very much eased my job to file my IT returns in time without any confusions.  
Great and fast service.  
The service is extremly useful, especially at times, when time is so scarce in today's corporate world. This is my second year, when I have used this portal to for second consecutive year without any hassels whatsoeverThank You !!!!  
Tax returns filing was never so easy. They H&R Block really simplifies it within 5 steps only. Thanks H&R Block...  
It was very nice experience to file income tax retun with help of H&R block,really happy with the service and advise recieved by your tax consultant.  
Enhance your questionnare regarding capturing individual information so as to separate savings interest from other (time bound deposits) interest income. In my case, I noticed while reviewing my prepared return that 80TTA was not applied and I discussed the same with tax prepared which led to changing my tax return from 400 Rs (payable) to 2690 Rs (refund).  
It is very good to e-file ITR. They provides good support.  
Thank You H&R Block Team. It was a easy and smooth transition with you guys... You help me a lot...  
Very satisfied with the work done by your team  
Great work! Thanks for all the help.  
Service are good, whenever I called advisor responded back fairly and friendly. Probably you need to proactivily connect to customer for all conversations instead customer will always try to connect you back.Thanks.  
Hi,The experience was Tremendous, being here and to seek support. Things were very simplified and user friendly, it helped a lot.Just one thing though, wanted to get an insight on this year's tax filling (whether I needed to pay or it's the other way around), which I guess was overlooked. It would have been much helpful.Overall, it was a good experience! KUDOS and keep up the good work!! (Y)Thank You,-Sai  
Assigning a dedicated Tax expert was very nice as we can directly call and discuss the details easily.Very prompt response to any query through email/message.I do not have much knowledge about these tax sort of things but Tax expert explained the things very patiently and clearly.Good service  
Quick Response  
I faced lot of technical issues. I hope these will be looked at by H&R team and will be taken care off in future.  
good work done.  
Before submitting the returns at least Tax adviser should talk to customer and recheck the information  
My Tax advisor was very co-operative and was reachable anytime even around the end days while the last days was approaching.She gave me good advice and guidance also which was very helpful to me.Hope to continue with H&R Block for upcoming years also.  
Keep up the good work folks !!!  
I wanted to file for Tax returns for my husband, however we did not have an option to register and create an account for my husband  
Please also provide suggestions for tax savings/benefits proactively.  
H&R support was very helpful. H&R replied to my questions in no time.  
Your Service was Awesome. The continuous follow up on email help me to file my UIT Return before time or ele I would have surely missed it. Thanks a lot Team, hope you provide the same service forever.

This is the second year i'm using H&R block for filling tax returns. Immensely impressed with their timely service and expertise. Thank you!.  
An upfront Call from your representative must have been delight for me, rather than I calling to ask status.  
Really good and simple to file tax return  
Deepak has been an outstanding tax expert and I value his help on filing tax. I have consulted tax expert in past but the way Deepak worked was really excellent. Keep up good work and will take your opinion in future as well. Once again thanks.  
Keep it up, it awesome service received with best best chunk of advisers.  
I am thoroughly delighted with your response and expect the same will extended year after year.Thanks a Lot !!  
It was most easiest way I have filed ITR till date. Executives are very friendly. Most important, they are not pushy for any investment schemes.  
The way & timeliness the advisors respond is really appreciated. However, if the emails can be guided with further clear steps from a basic level along with the timeline of the next process, it will be more helpful for user that submit their returns. I am extremely happy with the service I received & it a generic feedback provided above by me to ehance the user experience and avoid any confusion.  
Very good help and quick response from the Tax Advisor Mr. Nani though this is free of charge. Regards Jagan Rao Infosys Bangalore 9986016378  
I was filing tax returns for the first time, and i bet, it could not have been made more simpler and faster. Only because of the personalized service and the expertise of HR BLOCK  
I really appreciate the mode you are following. First give the service free and then charge susequently so that customer feels it is value for monney  
The service is really Nice.The web portal is user friendly.  
Very good support and service. Keep it up.  
I liked the way I was kept informed and the friendliness of the advisor. Not to forget the job completed in timely fashion. Keep up the good work.  
Guidance for tax planning  
It was a great experience to work with the experts from H&R team.  
Brief Summary on the tax computation explaining the calculations on the tax components would be more insightful. But neverthless, the service is much appreciated. Thank you.  
Tax filing has become extremely easy for me in the last 2 years that I used H&R block. No more long lines and gathering around jammed printers! The staff is extremely responsive and quick in completing the entire process with prompt follow-ups over email or phone. Thanks H&R Block!  
Need utmost attention to details because there was some mistakes in calculations.  
excellent portal and advisor service.. life made hassle free. see you on next tax cycle. thanks.  
Overall it was good  
Great Service. Delighted .  
It was excellent interacting with H&R professionals  
Service very good  
Its highly appreciable of your effective job. especially timely reply & confirmation.  
I have excellent experience with H & R Block. Very systematic approach towards return filing, follow up, confirmation etc.  
Very good.  
H&R Block Is Really Good, You guys are really doing a Great Job!!  
Really very good block to submit the taxes.  
All good, keep it up. You were prompt, helpful and easy. A complete value for money.Thanks!  
It is helpful and easy.  
You made our ITR work extremely easy.  
I would like to thank Niharika who assisted me with filing my returns. Excellent turnaround time, prompt reverts and responses and very customer friendly attitude, thoroughly enjoyed our interaction and the experience in filing my returns was a delight. Thank you Niharika!! you're a STAR!  
Actually the service I got from hr block is awesome. They help me a lot in last 3 days to e-file my ITR.  
I would like to thank Apurva Deshpande for her promptness, quickness of service and guidance. Thank you!  
Mail Communication would be a great.  
Very good Punita  
Thanks for your valuable support and help in Tax filing on time.  
The login took extraordinarily great time about 15 min after I input my credentials. This experience was shared by my colleagues as well. Any improvement in this regard would be great!!  
NA  
The Tax Advisor followed up with me several times to check and confirm details which is very good  
Awesome service . With H&R Block it's Very easy to efile your return .  
The Tax Advisor is not proactive and I had to follow up 6-7 times to get my returns done over a week period. The steps involved in the process need to be clearly mentioned in your website. Still my returns filing is incomplete with the last step of Digital Signature or Authentication. I need to follow up again on this !!  
Very good service.  
everything was fine .  
Punita. Really appreciate your help during tax filing process. It was little confusing as I had two form 16 to take care of. Really appreciate your timeliness in your responses amidst of last days of tax filing. Please do sahre this feedback to your boss for a good appraisal ! all the best  
The service provided by HR Block is good

My tax computation was not correct and so I had to spend couple of hrs to get the data on Excel and then send the calculations for reference. Even after defining the error, the executive was not sure about the tax component; that was a big surprise to me. Later with superiors advise it was corrected.I didn't receive timely follow ups from executive; for a employee TDS, you must know the filing returns is not very complicated its the time which compels us to get a external service. Hence even after paying INR 500+ fees; I would have expected timely and no errors for my TDS filing.I didn't know any "Tax Saving Advice" service of yours; is that something you do after/during TDS files. If based on my data available with you; you have any directions for good tax savings for ongoing cycle; I would like to receive it.Nevertheless, I value you team to help me to get it done before 31st Aug. Thanks a lotRegards,Sachin  
Not able to easily connect to adviser due to long ques.  
The service in general was satisfactory. However after giving all the papers, the expert took too longer time to process/ respond. I could file the final document just before 2 days of dead line set.The time frame to reply shall be looked in to. I felt the value for the money, I paid, was utilised by me. Good job finally. I would like to continue the relation with this expert.  
Instead of customer asked you or remind you about different tax clauses, Your team should have to review his/her document thoroughly and proactively advised them. Additionally , start portal for next year tax planning.  
very good service, completly satisfied...  
Filing IT Returns was never as easy as this. My tax advisor at H&R block Mr. Piyush was extremely friendly and knowledgeable. I really appreciate his help and interest in ensuring I have tax savings.  
H&R Block service is excellent and tax advisor is very talented. I like your service. All the best and keep it up.  
Good Service  
VERY HELPFUL.I WAS FILLING MY INCOME TAX FOR 1ST TIME, IT WAS REALLY A GREAT HELP.  
Excellent work, please continue the work and progress. All the best!  
Apart from the Tax expert advice if you could put online help on Tax heads and publish the IT rules against each head, could help to check what all could be avialed but have missed out.Overall I am impressed with the service H&R has provided to file the returns in quick time.  
Extremely happy with the fast and friendly services I received.  
Excellent service,prompt response from advisor everytime.  
I have been filing income tax return with the help of H&R block from last 3 years and it had made too easy to file return. I am very hapy with the service provided.Hoping to continue in the same way next year:)  
excellent service. H& R block rocks.  
Good Service

Everything was just perfect and Virbhan extremely professional and helpful.  
There were prompt replies from the tax expert, the support was great.  
I like a lot, your friendly supportness and quick responses. Thank you.  
The service is excellent and very good follow up from the Jagdish (Tax advisor) who has really worked out things so good and effectively to give his best.  
Excellent follow up and Wonderful coordination while calibration.....Amazing Service....Keep it high all times.  
Good service and timely response.  
Reading Form-16 should be more accurate and should be updated to all pages automatically.  
I ended up paying 120,000 in income tax against 1,200,000 income. due to your assessment, this doesnot seem likely with my investments. but due to lack of time I had to rely on you to do this. I was hoping more in-depth help from H&R for saving tax, instead I ended up paying way more. thoroughly disappointed.  
Thats really nice to be a client of H&R BLOCK. Its time saving and stress free platform.  
Timely Services that I got at the last minute to file my tax filling is classic. Also saved lot of my time on this tax e-filling process. I would refer this to my friends as well.  
Website was easy to go through and Tax Advisor too helped us in getting things done. Overall satisfied with the service and personal care they took.Thanks  
I like the service & working speed.  
Very quick response and good customer value.  
Hello Team,Being from an Customer service oriented organization I truly understand the importance of the "Quality" of service and the personalized manner in which it is delivered.I must say the tax advisor assigned to me (Silky) was very co-operative and well behaved and extremely patient in answering all tax calculation related queries and she clarified all my doubts by carefully listening to me.I really appreciate her professionalism and behaviour and hope we'll keep this healthy professional relationship in future also.RegardsVivek  
I would recommend Live chat option rather than message box system for effective communication  
Even if it was free for OLA employees, can you tell me what are your charges so that I can let my friends avail your services  
h&r block given good support for us to all friends,giving such good information about tax preparation,Also thanks for Reshma Mam giving good support and strong follow-up for IT return.Thx... H&R Block Team.......  
good  
All good. Keep it up Guys !!  
Ease of filing the returns made me recommend H&R Block to my relatives and friends  
Please continue the same support.  
I was almost struggling to compile my taxes & had number of questions running late before the closure date. I was suggested to use H&R Block. I tried & it only too 10 mins & the response time was great. Within 2 hrs I was done with including my e-verify of returns. Thanks a lot for the fantastic service.  
good  
Good Service give by advisor  
Excellent support and tool is very user friendly  
I recieved mail and msg that you will contact me on xyz date, but i didnot recieved any call not work was done so i have to contact you, but when i contacted it was done.Pls. take it as feedback and not complaint. Overall service was very good.  
No Call after input my details. I think better to send messages make one at the first time. I was waiting for the call, but after two days i was checking the messages and i made a call.Thanks for considering this.  
Mayuri was just excellent.. Too Good & Professional in the way she handled my filing the return and handling my queries till closure.  
Nice experience all together.  
The tax experts were considerate and thoughtful. I liked the way they explained the nuances and were good listeners as well. I will surely recommend H&R block to friends and colleagues in the near time.  
More Publicity  
Very prompt and response received on timely basis  
The response to the queries was instant and the return was prepared in a very short period of time and submitted for E-filing before the due date...  
The feedback of H&R block is too fast and quick.  
i believe i still did not get clear idea if i have mother & a family dependent on me what medical reimbursement i should get...& under which section & how that i can get from salary  
It was a good experience working with you. Thanks for the support provided. I liked the messaging system which is place for responding.  
after paying Rs1200 it's hard to call and speak to a real person, we end up spending money to call your std NUMBER and still your person was not available. as per your computation we are asked to pay 60k, but never explained the rationale how this sum is arrived.I am still waiting for response form YOUR consultant. it was not worth the money I paid, I should have gone to local person with I could have worked in real time rather waiting for msg online  
Thanks a lot for your support..  
I need personalized servie so i can plan for mytax for next yar  
1) Its easy to navigate on your site however there are more enhancements that can go in there.2) I already did my wife's returns through your site with paid services.3)Not convinced why the charge is as high as 565 where as some people do it for 100 or 200 rupees.4) Not very clear on what is guided and unguided service.5) EVC verification could have been made easy.  
Very good service, i was worried as i had two form 16s as i had changed jobs and wanted to make no mistakes. H&R block solved all my problems. Thanks a lot!  
also liked the promptness with which it got done  
The service was really good.  
Response was very prompt and overall service was very good. Satisfied.  
NO  
Very Quick Response - Keep it up.  
very nice service..keep it up..will recommend to my friends and family..thanks  
To get in touch with our tax experts we have to call 5 times still expert is unavailable...Please provide extension number of our tax expert  
Delighted with personalized service & tax advice of H&R Block... No need to visit tax consultants .. Tax filing is one click away with help of H&R Block tax experts !!  
I am delighted to get such an services.  
Great support.  
Excellent support provided and timely ! Thanks.  
From 40 days I was not able to upload the FORM A & B on the block and at the death period after numerous calls it was done ... why don't u follow your own rules that if there is any problem in uploading you have mentioned that you send the form to us and we will upload ..... this was great inconvenience .  
I am scarification in your services  
The tax advisors explain what was asked clearly. Continue this trend and this would create a big impact.  
Nice, professional approach towards return filling.  
you make my ITR filing so easy and provide information that was needed. Thanks  
Nice Experience. Thanks and We need your Help in Future.  
Need to be more friendly while filling tax...like how can we save our taxs or wheter we can save or not...such advices should be considered.  
VERY GOOD SERVICE , PROMPT FEEDBACKS AND CLOSE LOOP SYSTEM  
Even though site says Tax consultant will reach out to you in 2 working days, I did not receive a call on the status. I had to follow up a lot to get the status. If it takes time to prepare the tax filing, let it be but there should be communication on saying it will take time.Work done is good. Seriously there is a lack in communication.  
Great work. I had a very good experience as a first timer filing ITR with your company through IBM. Keep it up and always be user friendly.  
No improvements required. Btw you are very quick in responding. Keep it up  
Less time consuming  
As a Industry Leader kindly give a Hand Book to All your clients on Tax Saving in the Month of Aug / Sept to plan their finances.  
Great experience in getting my tax filed. Personalized service with regular calls and emails helped me file my taxes timely and also helped me clear few doubts regarding tax filing. Overall highly recommended specially for people who have some complication like foreign taxation and capital gains.  
Love this site & the frequent response I received. I've already refereed my friends as well.  
NO  
I really appreciate your service. The message chat is very useful as the chatting are getting documented and easy to communicate. Iam delighted with the service you provided.  
I would request you to provide the service when we upload the FORM 16 where we have to save money to avoid more tax on our yearly income. Anyway your service is good and request you to advice further whenever it is required to avoid tax from employee benfits.  
Quick response is one of the most factors which I felt and user friendly service ... Keep it up Swapnil !!!  
it was an extremely pleasant experience. I did not expect that you will complete all the activities without my doing anything but sharing form 16 etc. even e-filing was done by you and I just had to see the results on the screen.........Kudos!!my heartfelt gratitude to the team and my courteous coordinator.  
nothing..  
good service, thankyou.  
Good Service  
It was really helpful.  
I would expect to file my Tax returns with minimal iterations and confusion .I did not expect the minimum to be so minimum. Excellent work done by the consultant.  
Very Nice Service, I never thought of this online service with expert!  
Thanks for assisting to file my tax papers. I have been your customer since long time.Thanks,Sasi.  
yes it's very easy and time saving proces. in my case it will take 5 minutes  
There was so much of miscommunication. Your people ask for the number and tell that they will call, but never did. When I call no answer. This happened multiple times.For the fee amount also so much of confusion, no clear information.  
No other specific comments, i think service is good for me and i hope it will much better in future for every one.  
No  
Good Site for New person who submit IT Returns  
The level of service that they offer is pretty decent. They call you up proactively informing you about the necessary steps for filing tax. Pretty good for those who are freshers cause they hardly have any idea about tax and all.  
This is more important that how we do investment so that we save tax maximum. If your tax expertise provide this type of solution to individual basis than it is very helpful to us. If you provide this service please contact me,I am very much interested to take this service from you. It will be also a whole year planning not be one or two month.  
Sneha Srivastava, was friendly/professional enough to do the necessary actions. Although staff is good, here are the drawbacks:1. Website of HR Block, is really painful/Lousy. Not user friendly in this 21st generation of cloud computing. If I upload a document, lets say mistakenly twice, no option to delete, and it shows two documents uploaded with same name. Anyone can get confused.2. After logging in, there is no need of page, where it says, Continue filing return, waste of page, waste of time, waste of effort.3. Messages for individual and tax agent, is just like a plain text, no data and time reference, no highlighted texts...It sucks. Reason, there are people like NRI who files the tax with different timezones.4. There should be a dedicated link to add bank accounts for any refunds or primary savings account.Overall, you guys need lot of improvement on your website.  
I was assigned Deepak as my Tax advisor, I was quite delighted with his friendliness and his curiosity to solve each of my concerns with importance. Even though he was busy much, but he made sure to call me back in the very next free moment he got. I am really thank full to Deepak for helping me out with my ITR, And a Thank to H&R Block team as well for their friendly advisors.  
Charges is high. should not charge to HDFC Bank employees.  
Everything is fine.good job!!Add few more functionality on official site .  
Good Job, But you may try to attach screen shots for better instructions.  
Im glad and satisfied at the service providing by your organisation in efiling the Tax returns.This is very much helpful to the new tax payers like me and also to the others to file the error-free returns.I would be more delighted if the Tax expert says every filing detail after E-file is done upon the customer's interest. So that the new Tax payers like me would come to know how they gonna get returns and how much we are paying to Govt.  
H&R Block tax experts, to name - Utkarsh & Rohit, who I dealt with during my tax return filing of FY 2014-15 were extremely professional and answered all queries diligently.Their advice was very helpful and made tax return filing seamless & easy. H&R Block is providing awesome services and I am sure to take these always during my tax filing & recommend it to others.  
Thanks for your quick and appropriate service.  
they had a good follow up approach.  
Really delighted about your concern towards your clients ! Wish u all the best  
Mohd Faruq was of great help and he made my experience superb and my thanks to him for the personalised and courteous service.  
Loved to file itr in so simple steps with no efforts  
There might be an improvement in The Tax Saving Advice I Received.  
Simple,fast and easy to file Tax returns. Good experience.. thank you  
Keep up the good work. Thanks for making the process hassle free and easy. Have already referred two relatives.  
Dear Sir,This was the first time that I filed my returns through your firm. I am based overseas. I would like to inform you that I have been delighted with your services, advice on tax savings and promptness. In particular, I would like to thank Mrs. Manjusha Pawar, who handled my tax returns, on her thorough professionalism in answering all my queries as well as pointing out my correct residency status to me, due to which I would be eligible for a tax refund.RegardsAmit  
When I am using your paid service, I expect all entry work to be done from your end. If there are some taxes I need to pay, I as a customer using your paid service should just be involved in doing the payment and no other work. There are tax advisors who take 299Rs and will do your entire work if tax filing by just coordinating with you over phone. Even after availing your paid service I had to bother to fill up the form to pay extra taxes etc.  
In the ITR form Rference no not mentioned.kindly let me know  
You guys are really quick. Within 2 days I was able to successfully file my taxes. Thanks for all the help.  
Its simply great service and appreciate the effort..  
good work  
The one-to-one discussion with me by your Consultant - Shiv was appreciated !My special thanks to Shiv for this.  
I liked your system of tax advice...very much  
So far so good  
The advisor did not sound professional during my communication. There is scope for making it better. Basic expectations met. Thank you for the service.  
No comments  
Awesome service and very quick response !!  
Would like to have a personalized service which includes tax saving Advice.Otherwise its amazing to see the speed of service in terms of computation and filing.  
The service provided is really fast and accurate . Liked the prompt availability of the tax advisor  
It was my great experience dealing with your team. Your tax Expert Mr. Akshay made my life easy in very short time. Thanks a lot to Akshay and your entire teamRegardsSuresha  
With H&R Block every person should be able to file his/her tax without any worries and be part of this nation building exercise.  
The process is very simple and the experts assigned to handle the case has good knowledge.  
Great and Faster job. Thanks  
The response was instant.Thanks for making our lives so easy.  
Really good experience. Thanks for your help.  
It is simplified.  
I was to add one more bank account detail. while I was trying to get details of the bank account unfortunately got disconnected. When I reopened my account the form was closed. I tried to call up your center. Every time I was told on recorded message that your consultant is busy and will get back. It never happened. My return was submitted without filling details of one of the bank.  
I think you guys are pretty good, only thing is that I hope you keep the client data confidential  
I appreciate all help provided by my Tax Advisor.  
Good.  
I tried so many times to reach tax consultant but it was just impossible. Even after leaving my number no one called.  
They provide simple, smart and easy solution to all your return filing issues.. With great team of tax experts - H&R is a new definition in the difficult world of filing returns.. :)  
H&R is well expertise in Tax filling. The Advisors( Snehal) is very prompt and proactive. She helps in filing without much my follow up . Very good Professionals are around there.  
Thanks HR team excellent work.keep going  
The filing method is extremely simple and even a new user can file the ITR with much of an ease through you guys help. My experience is very nice dealing with u. Hope the bond will remain as it is and u will improve and succeed more and more in the field. thank you so much.  
People utilize services like these because they have half knowledge and don't have time to update themselves properly and hence may commit mistakes and lose money. So , when preparing the tax computation , we trust that your experts will do the best for us , but my recent experience says otherwise. Firstly I was told that in Form 16 if HRA is claimed already you can't claim the differential amount (if any) in ITR which is absurd. Secondly ,simple HRA claim calculation was not done properly and I had to correct him which makes me doubt the other calculations as well. I expect you to improve on your "expertise".  
There should be more out going calls if customer is constantly waiting for call. Also, more instrument or employee should be there to attend incoming call as customer care no is always busy. It's seems more infrastructure issue rather than the employee issue.no planning for over burden days.  
Very good experience  
I appreciate your tax advisers support at odd time of the day. Easy to use application  
I was extremely pleased with the pro-activeness and friendliness of the H&R Block Tax Consultant.  
This was my first time online with tax payments and I am still a little unsure if its all been done, but am very glad for Tabassum's virtual presence and will continue with H & R next year too :)  
Keep up the good work !  
I had an awesome experience. I am sure to recommend you guys to everyone  
Very easy and understandable format of tax summary generated by advisor. Thanks team.  
There was a mistake in the first computation that was submitted to me and when I informed about the same, I was told that it was because of technical glitch.  
I liked the way the Professional handled my ITR. The charge that I had to pay, I found it value for my money. He was professional in is approach, and kept following up with me even when there was a delay on my part. I received call on same day when i left message. Once all docs were uploaded, he was very professional and quick to complete the process and guide me at every stage what to do. I definitely would recommend their services for Tax Filing.  
Prompt and accurate response by the experts. Thanks Niharika!  
Thanks a lot for such a professional service...Will recommend to others as well  
It is a disconnected process. If it can be made straight through processing without any human intervention for straight forward cases, that will help.Support from Staff was very great.  
Tax Expertise & Tax Saving Advice I (didn't)Received both needs to be improved  
I think this is an excellent service being given by this team. What I have seen people struggling for filling ITR and submitting the report, sometimes they are not sure what to fill and sometimes where and how to submit it. On H&R, you just need to login and initiate it... rest will be taken care by the team.  
its a good experience for me to take the services of H & R.

The Tax Adviser Bhusan is Amazing. He has been of great help and prompt in response.He is very approachable. I thank him for all his effort and handwork Just a feedback - Please give client a call. Ever time, email does not work for clarifications.  
An amazing service I have received ever in this regards  
immediate response & quick service.  
Would have loved some advice on how more tax can be saved being within the permissible guideline set by IT law.  
If the agent makes a call and help us with how the process is would be appreciated and benefit.  
It was nice experience and request was taken quickly and work completed was outstanding. The response and work done by the tax expert was good and delightful. Overall I am not in the country when it was done. Overall it is a good experience and I would like to recommend it to my friends.  
I am really delighted to have your service with frequent update and requesting necessary information to file. Need to say special thanks to my personal adviser Pankaj as well on his follow ups. Lucky to get your reference from my friend. Aa++ service...  
Durgesh was very helpful and friendly. He has sent multiple followups while I was inactive and helped all the way to complete process otherwise it would have got delayed.  
Thanks  
Excellent! Keep it up.  
none  
thanks a lot for providing better service  
Quickest and easiest Tax filing experience!!Great Turnaround.  
It was my my first experience with H&R but very impressive.  
Why servicre is free? If we get any thing free then it seems fishy sometimes  
Very prompt in services,recommended to my colleagues also,they were happy with the service  
Ms Pavana Kamat did a fantastic job. I found her very professional and US Tax expert. She guided mem through the process until the end. I was worried initially about filing my US Tax return sitting in India specially double taxation avoidance treaty between India and US. But She made it much easy. Thank you Pavana and H&R Block.Best Regards,  
Great service

I would like to Thanks Mr Virbhan T for his valuable inputs on tax saving and also to H&R Blocks for providing this service.  
Thank you for your valuable support,this is very good community development.  
I haven't got any Tax saving advice from your side.  
I am trying to reach my tax adviser from few days but not able to contact her. I am at last stage of filling tax but not able to go through. For that I wanted her help, but not able to reach her.  
If you can provide us tax savings options and regular updates of the different forms/norms that government proposes which are required for a working individual to fill/know on time can help our association for a longer perspective.

Thank u H&R Block Tax Advisors.Special thanks to Mr.Swapnil for the service he provided.  
Till now the process was simple and easy.  
Excellent and delightful customer services provided...Thanks for the Good Site..  
please provide the brife information about tex deduction.  
There were instances where in I had requested my Tax expert Amit to call me however there was no call made and I had to follow up.  
The service is revolutionary! I am sure H&R Block has just touched the tip of the iceberg. It will be one of the most valuable company in its field in coming years. Respect the service combined with technology to make things simpler.  
Excellent web site which is very usable and is the main reason for the high rating that I have given.  
You are okay to prepare ITR brake up but you take more time to file ITR on the ITR website. It can be reduced and make flexible.  
I am very happy all process was done very fastly, within 1 days. Thanks.. for you quick response.  
Very prompt response...keep up your good effort.  
I'm delighted with the service provided. What differentiates your service with the rest is the simplified process, individual attention, your internal tracking mechanism with which you followup as and when required is commendable. Thank you so much for the service.  
Excellent dedication from Ashwini.Overall fanatastic experience.Thanks again!!!  
very good service  
You all are awesome, making life easier for everyone...Many Thanks...  
It is a great service provided by H&R, was very timely and corporative towards providing solution to all the query raised.  
It was nice experience, all my queries were answered. I was finding it difficult to calculating tax for Foreign Shares (capital gains) by myself. H&R helped to do the calculation meticulously and helped me filing the tax returns. Tax advice given was good. Good job. Thanks. All the best.  
2014 I was much happy to discuss with the tax person assigned to me because of his communication and transparency .for 2015 ,the person who called me ( not the one who was assigned )did not had a good communication .It was not clear to me with regard to his tone .Though I have my own knowledge here , I did not thought to discuss more .There are certain clarification which should be answered in laymen way and not in an expert way( query was on home loan) .The person you are talking on the other side may or may not be tax auditor or Charted accountant,therefore you can rush to explain on different section 80C,80D etc as that's not for us a daily job.We do this once in a year Therefore this year (2015) it was not a good experience.  
Provide very excellent service. Highly satisfied.  
Excellent One. Very much delighted.  
No  
My tax was filed in no time. I am extremely happy with the service  
Great Experieince  
Excellent service....  
In Case the allocated Tax Expertise is not available to respond to your call, the call should diverted to next Tax Expertise in his/her absence.  
Tax consultant kept on changing for 2 times. I had to explain whole thing 3 times. It took total of 1 month to complete tax filing. There were multiple mistakes and I ended up paying extra tax and I need to wait for refund now.  
I was issued 2 form 16 due to 2 different TAN number for HYD and BLR with the same employer. However, the tax consultant was confused and mentioned that I have additional tax liability of 22k. The tax expert need to work proactively and provide better customer experience. Thanks for all the assistance!  
In now a days when you don't have much time to spend with family the other headache is to file the Income Tax. Through this it is very easy to fill your IT Return with some simple click. No need to worry about your tax calculation and sending hard copy to income Tax department.  
Many many thanks Divya... You are really supportive and your system made ITR file process simple for me. Good Job... Well done...  
Satisfied with the service and support from tax adviser. Thank you so much.  
Very impressed with your introductory service. Really looking such wonderful service consistantly. If you manage to maintain this, I am sure your company will grow very fast. Thank you.  
The service is very good follow up is excellent.To communicate by phone is little bit difficult please modify the process and when person registered by that time not communicate, if your team is call back so nice.  
Very prompt service. However would have appreciated if you had waited for my consent before filing the return with the IT department.

Simply fantastic help from H&R Block Tax Advisors  
The overall experience of seeking assistance and getting the IT return submitted via online was quite good. In the past two years due to hectic project based schedules, could not meet my personal tax advisor in person and missed my deadlines to submit the return. However the on-line route to seek assistance is quite simple and easy to get it done with expertise and professionalism.  
Keep up good work.

I need a personal call from you side to explain things  
All said & done, it was a good experience to get a Tax expert who helps us in getting our Taxation. However, all the communications was only via email / SMS. Not sure if you can call back or educating the clients to make them understand on what basis the calculation was done on both deduction & returns of the Tax & how can the client get benefited in future Financial Year.  
very quick feedback & user-friendly system is relay delighting me.  
Quick and reliable service.  
The entire process took more than two days. Software should read Form 16 , create report / make payment and efile. System is not fully automated  
Quick response  
I really appreciate to to this initiative  
Online systems and the processes.

It's very simple to file your return here. One concern is my tax advisor didn't update my mobile number after I called and the old number is appearing in the document.  
I am satisfied with the services provided by H&R Block India.  
I was very happy dealing with Kaustubh from your team. He came across as very knowledgeable person on taxation and also he was very prompt in responding to my query. Thank you.  
Very nice service  
Great! work manoranjan :)  
I did not receive any call from tax advisor. but my efile was prepared in a day.  
Hello, It was very smooth and your executives are really helpful me to complete this process. This is the first time I filed my tax. Thanks for your service. There is no need to give free service and if you can bill me like other portals and willing to pay...:)George Joseph  
One of the easiest and user friendly Tax filing Portal on India, I have tried other portals previously but the kind of attention and support I experienced here is remarkable and I would strongly recommend this portal to others.  
once we call on your published number , we will not been able to talk to your advisor at any given point of time. Every time it comes busy or all your advisors are busy attending the calls. Then your recorded message says that the concerned person will call me back. I made at least more than 15 calls in last one week time , no body picks up , only recorded messages... and no body give calls back...sorry for registering this comments.  
Impressed with quick service and user friendly portal

Very prompt and hassle free service.  
We are very much appreciating to your good effort in this. thank u very much  
Dear H&R Block Team,thank you for great service and followups.  
Overall it was good experience to associate with you for tax filing. Tax adviser Deepalakshmi has adequate knowledge and answered my queries readily to the best of her ability. However there are few opportunities for improvement which you may choose to focus for customer delight# The response time can be faster. It took more than 10 days for income from salary filing with capital gains.# Few corrections are done upon request. Need to focus on 'first time right' philosophy so that more customers can be serviced with better rating# Focus on skill development of tax advisers so that they can add value to customers in terms of tax saving and timely service.Thanks for the good work. I will definitely come back next year to your for tax filing.Best wishes  
Excellent Service!!!  
Your application is very user friendly and the tax advisor responded very quickly to my queries thereby making tax filing very simple and easy.  
Great service provided by H&R Block.

Filing return was a hassle for me on government site and i don't know about different clauses of tax.The personalized service is good, can be improved more .The site needs more user friendly interfacet as it lacks easy to understand points to search for.Please look into this.Documents security is must you should take care of this.Fee is okay ,must be affordable to every average tax payer as indians are more price sensitive.Best wishes for your people to save every penny from indian pocket.Thums Up......!!

I still don't got to know my Income Tax return status. I was promised that I would receive a call within 2 days. Still, I have not received any call. But I am fine, the company filed my returns for free.

I have been using H&R Block website for filing my tax for past 2 years. And I feel comfortable and it is very user friendly in submitting the details.  
It was a super fast and personalized service, with a tax adviser reachable on call and quickly making the required changes.Though there was a small discrepancy but that was because of form 16 required a little more depth understanding but it was quickly resolved when i pointed it out.  
missed receiving "tax saving advice" expert tips. nevertheless the whole interaction was smooth and quick.  
I want to thank Akhshay  
Reshma was extremely extremely helpful with my tax filing. Although there were delays at my end, she was patient and helpful.

.  
The Tax expert I worked with 'Rashmi' was very helpful. Appreciate herr quick turn-around time. Perfect 10 for Rashmi ;-)  
I think you should add some button to your web page for Tax saving advice purpose. If someone register on that then as of now some people from your side should be assigned to explain him/her the best possible ways to save the taxes. Many people are unaware of the ways. They just know about LIC, Mutual Fund etc. For example I was totally unaware of the Sukanya Samridhi Yojana. I came to know this after investing enough amount here and there :(This should be totally separated from the ITR process. As per my opinion if you combined both in one slot means if someone want to file ITR and you ask him to explain the tax saving ways as well, it will make a wrong impact on him. At last, your service is too good. Why don't you people organize seminars in companies regarding to the same and tell them how can you people help them so easily.Please do me one more favor. Kindly let me know if we can declared upto 150LPA under 80C and an addition NPA up to 50KPA? Means a total 2LPA under 80C?Thanks  
Excellent Service  
This is the best experience in the last 14 years. Computation was fast, advise was very good. Excellent experience...The tax experts have tax knowledge and are confident on what they say. Filing with H&R Block feels like filing tax sitting in an expert's office  
One of the easiest way to file your taxes.  
Service is Perfect. Amazing to find such a great support.Very quickly processed my filing.Thank you so much.Special thanks to Lakshmi.  
Tax expert never pick my call and never call me back.Still i am waiting for their phone call to know how to send my ITR copy electronically.  
Excellent service at no cost.Kindly continue this service.

Your website is very user friendly and good looking. Keep it up  
It's the most amazing site to fill your ITR. Never seen so user friendly and simplest UI. Simply the best.Thanks a lot!!!!  
The ease of filing returns at H&R block is really impressive. The personalised attention provided by the tax advisor was a real eye opener while filing taxes online.  
The executive was not confident and clear when I asked questions related to sale of stocks. When I am eligible to get the filing done for free, she didnt tell that to me and asked to pay to proceed further. Only after cross questioning, she made it zero. This results in trust issues  
This is the best experince I have ever had filing the tax. The tax advisor assigned was extremely prompt, knowledgable, customer centric and courteous. This was really a delightful experience.  
COmpared to last year this year the tax filling took lot of time  
Great TAT  
Valuable services received with online processing of all inputs and also follow-up calls with the dedicated Tax Advisor to ensure we do the right things and clarity on the Tax submission  
Extremely good services. Filled my IT return without any tension

H&R Block Tax Advisors need to spend little more time in understanding deeply the different nature of each customer needs and provide tax saving advices through personalized Service approach.

Good service  
Good Service  
I feel HR services and HR employees should have been more accessible to other employees.  
Overall experience was really good. But I would like to give one:1 As you dedicate one tax advisor for assistance, there should be a process where post filling the tax the advisor give you a call and update with last process of verifying it. This call can share different ways of verifying which is there on the last page and formal way of signing and sending to PF office.  
Good service !!!  
keep it up. I m so excited about this services provided by H&R Block which is so helpful.  
I am indeed highly satisfied with the service I have received. I would like to give special thanks to Manjusha who had worked me .She helped me lot in filling the tax and she is very professional and saved my money.  
Service should provided for 24 hours.  
Very helpful filling my ITR  
Your customer friendly interface.  
Phone call was made to me as potential customer but once I becme a customer services were not to expected standards  
the best service experience i ever had through out my life  
You listen your client about difficulty he faces and resolve them case by case . 'Do not Reply' type communication sends volume of information that may be simply of little value and mostly irrelevant.  
Prompt and quick  
Fee charging more compare to other competent in market.  
Your service is user friendly and easy to understand. I would recommend it to any friend  
Team H&R was very friendly and helpfull. H&R helped me in claiming back the excess I paid, which otherwise I decided to let go. Thank you H&R team.  
very meticulous support , frequent calls from consultants to remind and also to clarify wherever required. i did not have to worry about my returns when H&R is there:):)...Will certainly recommend your services anytime:) .  
The service was very good  
Excellent support! Good Service! I have already recommended H&R Block to my colleagues.  
You have made life much easy with your personalized advisors help and i never felt tax filing would be so easy.  
HR Block is very friendly and fastest service provider in the field of Tax Advisor.Thank you HR Block Team.  
It was easy and interactive, to the point......I was a first time user and already started recomending this to my friends...  
Tax adviser helped up to receipt acknowledgement.Ensured in person, is a rare & glad experience.  
Excellent service  
Easy to interact with your tax advisers, friendliness and willing to support and discuss. Having good knowledge in what they are doing.Had very good experience. Very appreciable work.  
I really got a very great help and timely response from your tax expert and he explained me so well. I am delighted to have service of H&R block and feel 100% satisfied the way it was handled with care and timely response. Thank You Very much team, a way to go!!  
HR Block provided me :1. Timely services2. Easily access on phone3. Hassle free service4. Good suggestions for filing the tax returns.5. The web site navigation is user friendly  
Very good experience. Simple steps to file tax returns. I will prefer this service next time.  
The services were very good.  
The Assistance from H&R has been great. The tax experts are thoroughly educated and were able to give clarifications to each question I had. the communication has also been very smooth, replies were prompt and had full explanation. I definitely will recommend this to other people, friends and family.  
You can suggest customers to do submit ITR online which will be easy and fast. Provide steps to submit ITR online.  
It would have been great if you could also suggest ways to get the IT returns. H&R Block only helped me to file IT returns for 5,777 out of 21,014. For me I am still loosing a big amount of money.  
Excellent  
Vaibhav was the person who did my taxes and he lacked basic tax knowledge on long term and short term capital gains. He even missed the u/s 80 TTA deduction and I literally did my taxes myself. I uploaded all the computation sheets and told him what need to be done. You can review the message history and the excel sheets I uploaded in my account and you would know the details. I have been doing taxes with HR block for last 4 years ( 2 years in Bangalore centre and 2 years online ) and after this year experience I do not want to consider HR block going forward.I think it is time for HR Block to get the folks with right knowledge to do the tax returns.  
Good experience  
Appreciate the timely response and the zeal of the tax expert to get the filing done on time. The ease of updating the details on the site was awsome. That makes me feel comfortable that the returns will be filed on time.  
It was great experience with you while filling up ITR this year. Your service is nothing less than superb. However there are more tax related concerns which I raised. Need your help to clarify that and fill the successful return.  
The Tax analyst has given a great service in e-filing my IT.Appreciate the speed and accuracy.  
H&R Block is doing a good Job, paying attention towards tax filing and seeking its customers with all sort of assistance on tax related queries, Saving time of customers.  
When submitted data for IT returns form has some invalid data, (for ex: wrong date of birth entered by mistake). IT returns cannot be claimed or uploaded to income tax department. So it will be on hold. This has to be notified to the user who had filled the details either by mail/call. User will in a waiting state for mail whether it has uploaded and will not come know, why its on hold.  
Its Good.  
I am very delighted because of service provided by H&R block.  
Great service, will definitely use again  
My Special thanks to Neha  
Hassle free filing of ITR. I was already late for it, but personalized service helped me complete it in just over a day.  
this is the first time in y life, tax returns completed in 1 hr  
Very nice and quick resolution to my queries.  
Process is very clear and hasselfree.  
Iam very happy with the service and would definitely recommend to others :)  
My tax advisor Tabassum provided very prompt service. She made multiple times changes as requested by me and got it completed in 2 days. I will like to get my taxes filled by her in future again.  
1)Message section displays on the messages received from the agent. It should have both inward and outward messages so that the user has an end to end view of the conversation.2) Not all personal data might be handy during account creation. The user should be able to add details like extra bank accounts at any point. This should not be restricted to the account creation time.3) The user experience on the site is not up to the mark. 3a)There are no links to other sections. user is forced to come back to the main page for all dealings3b)The 'back' link is given in grey coulour. Grey colouring is universally excepted as 'unactivated link'. It is confusing to use.4) There should be facility for the agent to note any alternate contact number provided in their view. I was out of the country during the window of filing. Even though i had passed this info (and the alternate contact number) in the response messages, every other message from the agent started with " your number is not reachable".  
It was good experience so far. Happy with the timely provided service. Thanks.  
I liked the ease with which i could fill in the details and upload my form 16. Had to do nothing literally to get my ITR filed. Thanks a lot guys.  
Hassle free process, very user friendly website. While filing my tax returns all I had to do was uploading my income statements (Form 16) and rest was taken care of.  
The Website is user friendly. It make our life easy to file the Tax:-)  
As of now I felt, it is good and no specific area require more focus  
Prasad was helpful. I have recommended 5 people already, very impressive  
Excellent experise and promptness admired me to H&R Block  
I got really a very good assistance from tax expert. They have answered all my small queries and guided how to e-file without hesitating.  
You guys just Rocked. It was a truly an amazing experience!I always used to get disturbed with this tax related activity but this was the first ever when everything went pretty smooth.Thank you once again !

Do you think, you are the only ones.. helping file returns??? Clear Tax reached out promptly. So i will continue with Clear Tax for their promptnes and customer friendly service.  
First time i got so easy and valuable service.....  
It is very easy process. Just upload the form 16 and ITR will get filled. ThanksNow no tension of filling ITR and no delay as it is easy process and No charges we have to pay.  
Its really very help full. The guy (Ravi) helped me a lot to understand the things well. Awesome service.  
Excellent services provided by Tax Expertise. Thank you very much.  
The service was quite fast and the IT returns activity was completed in the shortest time. Tax saving concepts need to be shared / educated to the non-finance customers.  
HI ,Please ask all the particulers before doing coputaiton may employeer forget. rest of every thing is good . i am appreciating you efforts to prepaire computations.  
I love the online interface. User friendly and intuitive.

Quick Service :)  
Excellent knowledge on TAX savings, Very helpful. Thank you very much.  
Response time through SMS is amazing.  
You guys are doing great job!Advice clients on tax saving opportunities proactively, they will thank you during IT filing.  
Extremely helpful website. Just Upload your form 16 and sit back and relax.  
Website  
I cannot deny your Expertise of personalized service assurance. But I cannot fathom the fact that assigned resource did not even read my comments leave alone respond. I am extremely upset as i wanted to gain extra information before filing, which fell into deaf ears. May be your folks are TOO BUSY or I fell in for the "Service guarantee" of my employe's ecommendation .. OR is it because IT WAS FREE ????. Personally I made the biggest mistake of defecting from paid service of Skorydov, which i have been using for the last 4 years. I paid the price for NOT BEING LOYAL and choosing to flirt with another vendor on the pretext of "Free Filing" Deeply regret choosing your service and Will never recommend this to anyone i know - Syed  
Great service. Thanks for all the help  
services were quick and efficient. as of now, no feedback  
Filling return with H&R Block is very smooth, its just like booking a Hotel on a any website  
this is my first time. my case was very easyhence considering my case i received the best possible response from you guysthank you so muchprobably you could have made an attempt to explain any possible saving schemes that could help me in the current cyclethats all  
Very friendly service. Services is almost extreme, keep it up.  
The best characteristic of H&R Block is their turnaround. Simply outstanding.  
Time to Response after uploading the documents or any information you need was extremely good.I will say anyone can simply rely on H&R block for their services. you can simply relax & channalize your effort in your work , jobs etc while H&R block will take care of your Tax Return.  
I am extremely delighted with the kind of service HR Block India has provided to me for completing ITR.  
Great Follow up! Good job guys!  
I'm glad to receive a great service from H&R Block. Your team is fabulous. Thanks for the services.  
Procedure to give details by tax payee to be prepared and give in their mail. Each and every communication to be given to tax payee by mail as well as SMS.if you have more than mail id of payee than send in all mail id. Every 3 days gap payee should be contacted up to his filling of tax.This a comments from my end.Regards,Kanak Sahu  
Reaching to the concerned tax advisor is extremely challenging.Need to have either a direct email or phone line for the concerned tax advisor to communicate far more easily.  
Juvi is my tax advisor and she is super quick in responding (in few cases it took less than an minute for her to compute the tax/process the tax filing). I am super happy about her service.  
Very Good Service for filling & Submitted the IT return documents. But i'm not received from adviser for tax saving ideas.  
Its very good. Would like to get some tips on how to receive better tax rebate.  
Awesome service  
Co-operative and instant tax Advise.Right place for all your tax queries

none  
Would like H & R block to give reminders to tax payers in advance so that plan can be done accordingly for savings investments (if required). Also if there can be any reminders system in respect to tax filing , uploading documents . the service will be the most demanded one.  
Excellent Service.....  
Very good, fast and personalized service. Keep it up.Special Thanks to your Tax advisor Mr. Amar for excellent support.  
H&R Block execuitive should check all the attachements sent by Assesee for filing his/her retutns. Do not file returns only based on the basis of FORM 16 issued by Employer, becuase FORM 16 may only contain declared invsetment details but investment made during the year later may not include.  
Thanks you for amazing service. Purushottam was extremely helpful and prompt in his responses. I had a very good experience working with him. H&R made the process a piece of cake.  
Friendly advisors, work completed in minutes.  
Very fast and perfect on work. Close coordination for filing of ITR and updating information.  
So far I don't find any area of improvement. Extremely impressive.  
If posible just make a call to new client,So that they can clearly understand all the steps related to this process.rest all I think is good.  
I used the service for the first time and the service provided was truly amazing. The time Bhushan (the Tax Expert) took was so swift that within hours after my request, the ITR was filed. Thank you for such an amazing experience. Will definitely recommend the service to others. Well done!  
Great work. Quick response.  
" Kind words do not cost much " that's what I have experienced with H&R BLOCK . As I had ton of questions regards to Tax E-filling , you guys have answered it in a polite and professionally manner . I am very happy with the service provided to me and would recommend the same to my co-workers and friends for go for H&R Block . Thanks  
for last one week I am keep following it on regular basis. Yet my ITR was not filed. I am frustrated much. No proper communication.  
First of all, Thank you very much for helping me to file my returns so quickly and that too without any cost. I haven't expected this can be done so easily as I'm filling it for the first time. I would definitely recommend my friends to opt for your services.Secondly I would like to bring to your notice that:I receievd email communication that I need to submit ITR V via post to Banglore and also we can validate it online for which I would receive the email from your adviser with detailed procedure. SO far I have not received the details. I prefer to validate it online instead of going it for physical one. Could you please check on this point and provide me the detailed procedure to validate my returns online.Best Regards,Bharat Patil  
it's so simple. Thanks for being there.  
The HR BLock TAx Advisor's patience to explain me multiple times really helped to finilase on the excess tax to be paid.  
This block helped me a lot in filing my ITR and its make process so easy and fast with the help of there experts.  
I appreciate Niharika's (my tax expert) quick response and She satisfied my each and every query very well. Great Job. Well Done Niharika.  
Very good user friendly portal.  
Sometimes there might be mistakes in form 16. You've provision for proving additional information (other than given in form 16), but there isn't any provision for amending the information.It would be good to have that.  
Mr.Ravi who was assigned to me was really great and very helpful in answering to my queries.Please give him a thumbs up from my side.regardsashok  
I have just uploaded the docs for processing. They did it quickly and called me often for asking documents. This is really a great job. I had a thought like how can we complete in one week. But they have done it in 2 days. Hats of to you! Thanks a lot :-)  
Very good, easy and clean tax filing experience from HR Block.

My comments would be that it was a pretty good experience, the way H&R block(Aniket :) My Tax Advisor) helped me to filed my IT.  
Service of H&R Block is very fast. They start work on any request immediately. I like their service to much.....................  
It was great experience to being associated with H&R Block, the simple way complete the task....:)

The service provided by Tejal was really awsome , it has been the best experience i ever had in my 7 years of career experience , really it is appreciable, amazing , superb, i do not have words to expalin the services provided by Tejal / H &R block.  
I was very delighted by the easy with which I could file my tax this year. I need help with refiling last year's tax, will reach out to you again.  
Easiness in using your website is awesome :)  
Very helpful and friendly TAX advisors. Keep up the great personalized service you guys are providing  
You compute the tax return and allow the client to submit online.Do you keep the uploaded document from the clients in your database?  
H&R Block tax advisor helped me save taxes beyond my expectation!  
Approach was simply the best.  
The way discount was applied (below the line) for services provided is against common accounting principles followed by any retailer. For a company like H&R Block following this and saying that this is how we do it for all is not what I expected a professional firm to do. Anyways, I could not do anything as my taxes were prepared and already filed. I was compelled to agree and pay. Was not given an option to escalate the matter to anyone else.  
You are fantastic  
Excellent service. I had so may questions and Gaurav answered all my queries.  
Thanks  
Hi Team,It was impressive to see such a simple process and sophisticated systems you have it. Appreciate your help in making this process simple.Many thanks,Chandru.  
First time I'm using H&R Block, it was a great experience file ITR and received the ITR file with immediate effect.Thank you H&R Block team.  
Keep it Up!  
Good service & timely responses from the tax expert.  
Its good experience with H&R Block.Tax efiling can do very easy with H&R Block.  
Nice Service  
Thanks& Regards,Sathish HM  
First of all, regret for my late feedback.This was my first year of filling tax return. And, initially was collecting information from everywhere possible to understand the process of how to file the IT returns. But, to my pity was unable to get a direction. And, then i came across with H&R Block from someone. Thereafter, my all disappointments went off with a click and was able to file my IT returns with entire support of H&R Block. I wasn't pushed to think at all about it to process and they file it for me that also free. That's amazed me !!I hope this remains like this for us like people in H&R Block for years to come. So, we can come again and again to get & sharpen our tax knowledge and experience from your ever friendly team of Tax Advisers & Experts.Thanks for your all support to make this a pleasant experience for me !!  
Loved the speed with which you turn things around... Also appreciate the system that connects me to my dedicated advisor.  
Good

You are just awesome !! Loved it :)  
I tried contacting 3 times to my represnetative on the number which was provided but was unable to reach him.The IVRS response says that the represntative will get back to you but i never got a call back. I would also like to mention he did a perfect job by verifying my documents and filing the ITR very quickly which was appreciable, i was unable to e verify it so i had some queries regarding that for which I tried contacting him but was not able to connect. I really appreciate the job dont by my reprenstative,it just the personalized service that I was looking for. Thank You so much for filinig my return,i will post my documents to Income tax dept Benagaluru as I am not able to verify from my system.Thanks

communication can be better by letting us know how to efile or send out ITV form by post.  
There are plentiful of agencies around who file returns at around Rs. 100-150.Though your service is certainly good, the Indian customer does stress on Price, and the premium charged seems to be too high.  
Indeed a prompt service from the team.  
The service was very prompt. I liked the methodology and approach.  
Response is very faster and quick. I would like to recommend to my friends and colleagues. Keep giving the same level of service!  
Good services

Agile, spot on, timely with their response and specific with what is needed in this entire tax filing process, they had all the expertise. Highly recommended. Thanks for all the services and help. Made my life related to TAX filing easy. Special mention for Bhusan, my personalized tax expert who made all this job looked like a cakewalk.

Timely response was goodI wish to continue with H&R block, even for paid services.Regards,Mustafa

Best service with effort,time & money saving.  
Excellent Services..  
Please continue doing such great job  
GOOD FOLLOW UP...  
Quick turn around is commendable. Needed more clarity on the ITRV-- if we need to send it to CPC or not.  
Well every thing was nice. Thanks for showing very good commitment for developing the IT return files.  
There is no prompt response to the customer, instead customer need to call every time for every doubt, I called more than 10 times just for my returns and the experience with H&R block was very bad.Also H&R does not providing any details before paying money, it is providing contact number of the tax expert only after paying money. Tax expert does know how to file the taxes and even inputs were provided by me to file. It was very very bad experience  
since this all is confidential & Personal data so please make all your security system to handle these data safely. Overall experience is Good.  
I also need advice for tax saving purpose.  
Very Prompt and quick response, I'm very happy.Great Work H&R team RegardsPrasad V

Service is very nice & prompt.Wish u best of luck & keep same momentum in future too.  
Filing my returns with H&R was such an easy experience. I guess, i would be doing it every year going forward. My tax assistant Revatti was very friendly and helpful. Their telecommunication is also very precise and not that time consuming. Had a wonderful experience working with H&R.

Have not spoken to the tax advisor.. happy with the services offered. Timely follow-ups and service.. a Tumbs-up..

Pls consider him on a for all his skills and super customer orientation ability in his evaluation and I am thankful to him for all his support ..I wasn't chrged anything for my returns and I already recommended my wife to file her returns with H&R help. Keep up the good work team.  
it's been so easy to use.  
Very efficient and fast service.  
My tax advisor was unable to provide any support on how could I save tax on my vacant property .  
My life is made easy by H&R Block. Never experienced such a smooth transaction earlier.  
The tax advisor was pretty quick to respond to my queries,this being the first time for me, and the entire online process was very smooth.  
It was really helpful experience. I have been customer of Tax spanner since five years but was not happy with their poor and slow service though was paying for it. But you guys gave quick and amazing service for peanuts :)  
I would like to thank H&R team and my personal co-ordinator Manjusha for the help and timely reminders.  
1.Reply has been really prompt .2. It was hassle free .3. Tax expert explained everything and then took my consent before uploading it on the ITR government website. Thanks a lot Juvi (Tax Advisor). Till date ITR filling has never been so easy for me .  
Veer and his boss Durgesh both have spent good time with me and had all the patience to help me and given the possible advice. Both are quite professional and service oriented and friendly. Thanks to HR Block and both of them.CheersSwamy  
It was a pleasant and fruitful experience. But the so called chat centre is of not much use.Should be improved like chat centres of major companies eg. tatadocomo. Also your site should have a customer care part also.  
the point of contact kept changing. is it always this way?  
Speed of response to your queries. It would better if we could have a call before the tax is filed online.  
Timeliness was the key, keep that up and you have it made.  
Very good service....keep it up!!!! Thanks  
Very patient team!! Super helpful as well:)  
Excellent service  
While i was happy with interactions etc but i felt as CA there has to be more questions to the clients how he can increase the savings and save on tax. they simply act as if they are filing my Form 16. I expect good help from the CA.Also the front ending people are not fully clear on the IT rulesAlso it will be nice to give suggestion to the customer how he cna save better or plan his finance better next time. No such service i can see.  
Great service  
Awesome service and quick response from Tax experts.  
Dear H&R Block Your Tax Expert:Your services are hassle free. Which to a common man are very reachable. Your expertise is splendid and awesome.

I am extremely happy with the service provided by H&R Block. I would like to avail the service again when needed and definitely suggest everybody to avail H&R Block services for any tax related matters. One suggestion is - Electronic verification details can be written more in detail - I wanted to e-verify using net banking and I had got little confused with the instructions provided.  
I am getting my e-filing done by H&R Block since last year and found they are very cooperative and transparent and gives immediate response to the query of clients and help in proper assessment of tax which in turns keeps us trouble free and gives optimum benefits.  
Was not able to reach over the phone number listed, even after multiple attempts.  
Very good service...keep it up.... :)Always one question strike in my mind :)Why H&R block give free service, when most of the tax consultants charge approx 150 to 200 for each Form 16 they process ;)  
I would like to thank archana.pathak for her immense patience in dealing with my query which lasted over 20 emails / phone calls. she ensured that my query is addressed and resolved to my satisfaction. Extremely happy with the experience.

Excellent service.  
Initially there was a mixup in hr block tax advisors and a big delay in getting my tax filed, however once it got transferred to Mr. Nikhil Kulkarni, he did a wonderful and a very professional job of filing the returns and answering all my queries to my satisfaction. Highly recommend to work with Nikhil Kulkarni as tax advisor.

Excellent Work...Too Fast with accuracy  
I appreciate the quality of service provided. Very professional and best quality service. Thank you  
I didnt recieved any kind of The Tax Saving Advices.But as far as response, tax computation and timely action is concerened am happy. If they could have provided any kind of advice to tax saving, then it will be a great help.  
You folks are fast,good and proffesional. Good job!!  
Very simple, thorough & intuitive web interface ... Very helpful associates ... For India, where a lot of people still depend on their CAs to do Taxes & Return, H&R Block is a blessing ... Even the free & non-sponsored interface is equally good, and free ... Also, I am not sure whether you do that or not, but, please have a Marketplace kind of offering, where people who have the requisite skillset can associate with you, and do backend taxes if it works out ... Just a thought, blame the e-commerce clout ... :) Keep up the great work ...  
Swift response on time  
It will be a add on if you give advice to your customers,by looking their return, so that they can do the investment in best way where they can get maximum benefit.  
You guys rock!

H&R block is awesome so user friendly and easy going all the instruction where so easygoing and helped me alot without having knowledge of anything  
The service seems awesome, I specially liked the easiness to login to the site, also although I am completely satisfied with the service, I would like to share one suggestion about the website, From many areas e.g. message section, we don't have link to home page or any other page, so it would be nice if we can add proper links to navigate between pages.You Are Best!  
You have very good system to take care of tax services also your staff is cordial and helping in nature.. your voice mailing system connecting directly to the personal advisor is really appreciable.  
Superb service.....  
H&R tax consultant was very affable, more proactive and helped me all through the process till filing the returns.  
Promptness is missing in above options. You score the max there i feel  
Tax Saving advice was not provided to me, also the Service Cost seems to be a bit high but that is not an issue.  
Overall experience with H&R block has been good.While performing the last step like generating EVC, probably more step by step information will be helpful for many people like me.  
Try to provide some suggestion for saving the tax apart from the Form 16  
Follow up all the times and reminding about the action need to take.  
Able to file the Tax returns with minimal work. Thanks for your support.Hope the same continues.  
ONE STOP FOR INCOME TAX RETURNS E FILLING, LET IT BE SIMPLE OR COMPLEX..

Hi, From last three years my tax returns are taken care by H&R block. The reponse is very quick & they are having a great expertise.  
excellent team and rajavarpu was outstanding. I am absolutely ignorant about taxation and the team assisted me very well.  
Keep up the good work & continue serving the same way.  
excellent service, thank you so much to kishna, krithika.  
It is extremely good.Just upload Form-16 and done which I like the most and form fill up is also very easy.Thank you very much.I really appreciate the website.  
the response was really good.. But seems like there is a difference in the tax calculation from corporate and from HRblock. Since I don't mistrust the corporate calculation, I doubt HRBlock.. anway pleased with the ease with which tax is filed..  
NO  
They all are very supportive and i like very much by talking with them.  
H&R Block is good service which saves our time and money. Tax return filling was headache for me but H&R Block done the job quickly, Thanks H&R Block.  
Experts need to be more accurate while filling up forms without making any mistakes (data mismatch or typo). Other than no issues. Overall Very good service. I loved it.  
Tejprakash is one of the best guy in your team i think.. He has sound knowledge on the subject & cares for the customers interest. He takes personal accountability to see that the end client is happy with the service.Many thanks Tejprakash again !!! it was fun to deal with you ...  
Keep up the Good work - thank you...:)  
NO  
No one responded to the call I made to 02230038111 for two days.  
I am first time applying for ITR.The process is very simple and easy;but i would like to know if you suggest how can we save the tax.  
Its a nice to have all the issues get resolved in one platform, H&R Block is the one.  
I like the patience of Krishna (my appointed Tax Advisor) who never got frustrated with my silly questions or attempt to increase my ITR.  
Fast ,quick and esay

My experience with H&R was really good. The advisor was good to guide me through the process, since I filed it for the first time.  
Very professional.  
H&R Block is best.  
Your advisor must learn how to converse in English first, the first advisor I interacted with had little or knowledge of the language spoken. Let alone help me.!!!The second advisor, Reshma was just perfect and the software of correspondence viewed in threads a good step ahead.  
Prompt responsiveness  
Hassle free income tax return by your team, really impressed with professional behavior and swiftness of your team, way to go.  
Once the customer fills all the details after the registration and submits it, the assigned tax extert should call the customer and review the tax form and explain the customer for any discrepancies in the filled form as the customer might not be good at completing all the tax related details.  
My Tax advisor was extremely quick in her responses and extended timely support. Thanks. It was a very pleasant and smooth experience.  
Your Executive Prompt response are really appricated.  
Can revert quick. Had three people assigned where i had to call in everytime before somebody responded.Once assigned it was a delight working with the person.  
Thanks for filing my ITR, It was a pleasing experience  
Service was quick and good  
Thanks for making tax filing hassle free. I appreciate Onkar, who always cleared my queries whenever required and letting me know each point in detail.Thank you H&R Block.  
Excellent & prompt services from H&R Block and Tax Advisor Mr. Jagdish.

The site is slow.Should allow multiple account sunder same log in id so that E filing of spouse/ other family members can be made.  
The process was quick and easy.Appreciate your help :)  
Ease of website use was a very big one.I would additionally recommend that your tax consultants ask leading questions that will open of tax saving opportunities that the customer may not know of.

There should be minimum charges for individuals salaried person. Where source of income is only salary. As it takes only 2 mins to prepare return of him..you should charge minimum.  
User friendly application & personalized attention to the customer to make sure the Income Tax Return and all tax related information are accurately updated.  
complete online experience and tax expertise.  
I am happy with the service H&R block had offered. One of best service experience I came across. Advisor is also friendly in nature. I would also like to appreciate the help Sagar & Saurabh offered to me. They are really awesome. Kudos to them.  
The Tax Advisor never called as he/she promised. I would like to have her call and provide some info on the Tax.  
It was really good experience considering the previous years... I would like to continue with H & R block in future. Thanks for all quick friendly and expert service.  
My Tax Return Preparer is possibly the best Cust service professional i have come across..., she called a few times, was diligent , Please award her she is 10/10  
Service provided by H&R is very best and procedure is very easy I like this very much.  
I would expect to get questions from the auditor to find out all sources of incomes. I felt like I was giving all the information and also told exactly what needs to be done while I got the clerical services that too with mistakes  
service is very good.  
This was my first time online submission, your team really made it hassle free and the prompt advice given is commendable. Excellent work guys, THANKS for the directions and HELP!  
This really was an Awesome experience with you guyz. I was able to fill my ITR without any issue.Thank You All!!--Ashish

NOPE. Doing Grear!  
On few occasions, I found some kind of glitch in the website. Except for that, I had a very smooth and easy processing with prompt response from the tax expert.  
It saved my lot of Time, before I used to visit CA office for this work, now I can file my pending It returns online on one click  
GOOD JOB. MADE LIFE EASY  
I'm extremely happy with the way you managed my requests.  
This was the quickest response I ever got, in fact I made 3 different queries which were addressed in a span of less than an hour and had my returns in hand. I would strongly recommend to my friends.  
I had left a message for a query for my tax advisor. But did not recieve any reply. I even called the number provided. But cannot reach anyone.  
There should be a dedicated contact number to reach to the respective Tax Advisor. I found that while calling on the landline, the call went answered. Secondly, While filling up the form, it mentioned that you do not submit Form 16, however, later on I was asked to submit Form 16 separately.Other than these 2 issues, the process of filing was Superb. Never thought filing tax returns would be so simpler. I got regular updates on the documents send to the Tax Experts.  
Its the first time I filed my Tax Return. The process was very easy and convenient thanks to H&R Block.  
Even if you lag in any step, they are there to constantly remind you and making sure timely document submissions are made.That's the best part.Thank you  
Thank you H&R for helping me and giving me a fantastic service.  
H&R Block took my part of worry and addressed it flawlessly  
Excellent service provided I am Impressed

with filing the ITR, if you can provide some small tips regarding how to save more tax and during filling the ITR as you people analysed the form-16 if you found anything missing like HRA declaration etc then it should be informed so that other person can save more tax.Thanks

It's Very hassle free service with expert advise. Great experience...need improvement for referring friends and family as it is showing payable...need concession in it....  
After providing E-Filing returns Advisors are not answering calls for clarification of some doubts.Its very nice if they attend clinets calls for thier doubts clarification. And rest of things are very nice before n in way of filing n receiving clients.  
Quick response and accuracy in the working are two observed highlights of your services.  
The overall process of e-filing is very good. I appreciate the quick reply to all the queries I had while filing of return.  
No response from the tax advisor after filing the ITR. I had doubts on how to file the E-verify. Called many times. No response from the tax adviser nor anybody called back.  
NO THANKS  
The sevice is awesome will like to use in future and also refer to my friend.

Very quick to complete the process. Extremely happy with the knowledgeable Tax Consultants.  
I never knew the importance of Tax Filling & all that jazz....Thanx to the Team .......really helpful....  
i don't have any other comments  
good portal for someone who are not comfortable to fill through Income tax site.  
Very nice website. It saved me all the hassles of filing Income Tax Returns !  
Please suggest on some tax saving strategies. If you have any such services, please contact.  
They have the required tax expertise and share the best practices.  
Despite there being Long Term Capital Gain/receipt in my Bank Account, Tax advisor, despite my insistence/repeated persuasion in writing could not give coverage against item 3 of Schedule Exempted Income due to his own calculations applying Indexation as the same getting turned into Loss. He neither covered it as Loss from LTCG and added to LTCG carried Forward. In short, he allowed it to remain "Un-reported" leaving me responsible for non-reporting of Income, converting my income as "Un-accounted" and black money despite my desire and repeated persuasion, he also could not give any satisfactory answer for the same. He just kept avoiding the same. Finally Ms.Madhuriji, got the same reflected against item 3 of Schedule EI. I really fail to understand then why he could not do so despite my repeated and clear written requests. Un-happy with the approach of earlier Tax Advisor.I would request to go through the written communications made by me in this regard. While H&R block asks everything in writing from the client, they don't follow the principle while it is their turn and communicated everything over phone to avoid the complications/their responsibility.  
Since you are providing a corporate level service, I am not aware of your charges to individuals other than corporate clients. So how can I recommend. Otherwise your services are excellent.  
It was nice and rapid response from the team members. They handled very friendly manner.  
HR Block are amazing. They are the tax experts and they are helping the people greatly. However explaining the things in lay man terms will help us a lot more.  
i am really thankful to H&R Block and specially thanks to "Rajavarapu" who helped me on tax returns from H&R Block. you ppl helped me a lot to complete the ITR process.  
I am looking for suggetions for Tax Saving and future savings.  
Make the call to customer for the get more confidence.  
really appreciative.  
The virtual process. No need to take an appointment or meeting with Advisor just upload the documents. It’s a Clean and transparent process. Thanks.  
Pl.make your website clear as when we are typing the letters it is showing very light in color.Eg:When we are typing login details it is not clear.Your Dash board has tobe altered for quick view.  
It was really a delightful experience to have my ITR filed through H&R block. I would like to appreciate the way you make things so simple and clearly understandable by integrating your domain expertise and personal touch. I look forward for a long association with your organization and I would recommend your services to my friends and colleagues. Thank you so much for your support.  
Very Good Service  
.  
Awesome service  
No specific comments but just that certain things were checked and rechecked again so before advising people should recheck themselves.  
Overall Good.  
thanks..  
The Tax advisor assigned to me was very prompt in resolving all my queries. I got my tax filed in less than 30 mins.Thanks and keep up the good work.RegardsMadhvendra

Was using TaxSmile till last year, decided to try H&R block through organization emails and simply loved it. Will definitely be back.  
This is really an excellent service of e-FILING . Special thanks to Rahul who helped me to complete my ITR as i could do this first time:-)  
It took 2 -3 weeks post my documents uploaded for tax expert to work on the same. Also, I had to remind 2 -3 times in the interim to pick the same.There multiple misses/ errors that I had to point out which the tax expert missed while preparing the document.  
Thanks for the quick expertise service!  
Nothing  
You must help the individual Tax payer on their financial planning.Its not just the Investment Planning or Tax Savings, but how an individual must plan his / her financials to achieve various goals in life.  
It was nice.  
Overall experience is excellent  
It was really good expereince and would like to appreciate the TAX expertise to call us specially for the latest update.  
It to the overall satisfaction of the client / customer.

Prompt service.NO hassle.executive are competence enough to explain things.  
Good Service.  
i am really happy with your services , hoping you will continues the same kind of customer service in future.  
I referred my friend to use your website for ITR but he changed 3 companies and he faced difficulty filling ITR . I personnally thinks that you guys are doing awesome job.  
Reshma was very quick and absolutely helpful.Much Appreciated.  
The response from H&R consultant was good and very quick.  
If you can advice tax saving measures in form of a newsletter or other medium, it would be great. If its personalised, nothing like it!  
All the best, Good Job  
It was difficult to reach the contact person through helpline. It always get disconnected saying that the person is not available at this time. Communication mainly can happen through web site, where I was getting a response on same day. Rest all was smooth  
ON computing and ITR form, there were few wrong values which were been entered. When checkted, got to know it was a system error. Would recommend to improvise in that section. Rest its Awesome :)  
Excellent service. Tax adviser was very efficient in answering the queries.  
Good and time saving.  
first time felt how very easy it is to file IT return & all this happened with click of mouse , "WOW"  
Thanks very much for the speedy job!!  
You may want to re-look at the number of Tax Advisors you need; as many a times it becomes difficult to reach out to anyone in your office as all are busy.  
It was my second year with HR Block and I am very satisfied. Thank You  
Would like to know "How can I save taxes" and receive personalized service on portfolio management.  
no  
I think this is the best Tax consultant I can have..fast and effective  
Commitment and on time fulfilment  
Am good with service from H&R.Thanks  
Just simple submission of form 16 to ITR-V took more than a month by H&R block. Time taken by them is too much.  
No  
The service was awesome - so much over and above my expectation and so much better then my previous experiences with other vendors. Keep up the good work.  
Na  
Great service with a perfect knowledge on Indian taxation rules.  
Dear H&R Block team, Thanks for the service provided.Regards,Rajani.  
Make a chat window.....instead of sending messages...or use whatsapp with the permission of the user.  
This facility of filling ITR is very helpful. Thanks for this.  
i am just happy that all thing happen in just one time . no query no issue complete work ...  
Very easy & great experience.If possible, provision for online chatting to be done.  
Thank you so much!  
Would like to see more on The Tax saving Advice.  
Extremely User friendly and Just 2-3 clicks and I have finished my tax return file. Thanks to H&R Block ...there is no more complex system to file a tax return.Keep it up Guys..  
I got a one to one representative who helped me to file tax online. I just provided him the detail and the whole process went smoothly.  
Nothing to Specify.  
The service is extremely good and of course free of cost. I really appreciate that. Only scope of improvement could be while providing tax summary, if the client gets to know about the full tax calculation done in the background and necessary information links for tax slabs - that would be of great help.  
Thanks for timely response and good service.  
Good Services  
Excellent service at less cost. Your website was easy to use. After filling the details, received a call from your consultant who asked few questions and helped me with good advice.  
Superb services. Very high level of professionalism !! Keep it up. Thanks for Your services.  
I liked the personal attention given to me and the advice of the tax advisor. A great site to get your tax filing done.  
suitable and timely advice from tax expert  
very fast and nice service. I already informed to my friends also.  
Great work! Keep consistent!! All the best  
It is Good.  
I found it very simple. Only the page where we upload form-16, there are no clear instructions on how to upload mulitple forms. One gets a feeling that Browse button automatically updates it.Also email is sent on both personal and work address. And SMS as well. This can be personalised and user can select preference.  
Very quick and prompt response  
1. Improve your email reply service, it was not informative, it was just a copy & paste of a ready template.2. Work on support service, I requested for some question and until now I did not got any answer.  
1. Service experience was outstanding and would like to receive the same experience year on year  
I really appreciate the service received from H&R Block.  
Excellent Service. Easy steps for e-Filling.When I have queries and call to customer care then it is directly connecting to concern person and saving lot of time.  
Very prompt and personalised service. Very impressed.  
I interacted with a person named Hema. She was very patient in listening to my concerns and appropriately explained the process to me. I was satisfied with the explanation given.  
Hello Team,Answering any other query related to Tax would help users a lot. However it was a wonderful experience using this website.  
I am very happy with the service provided by H&R Block  
The quick service which I received is really appreciated. I am happy that the H&R block team is on the right track to serve the people.  
No, Doing good Job.. !!  
I already recommended my colleagues to go for H&R and one of them already opted H&R for Tax e-filing. He said, he is also happy with H&R.  
Thanks for your promt service rendered to our company.  
The quick response and action to all events was the one impressed me.  
quick response  
no  
This is the best things to fill the tax with your advisers  
Really a very good service  
Really I appreciate their supports.  
The service provided here is very useful to me.  
There is a minor issue in portal. Even though the user enters the password, the portal is not capturing the password to open the files-form 16 and salary certificate.  
The overall experience and ease of usage stands out. You can enhance the client benefits by giving out guidnace on all tax saving options available for salaried employees  
Piyush was always picking the calls and tried to help in the best possible ways.This site is really v well maintained and good.  
no  
Deepti understood the requirement and provided prompt services. She is very good and I am highly satisfied.  
Yes. Actually, last year i could not add my Home loan Pre-EMI interest for my tax exemption calculation, as my EMI was not started.So, i was trying to revise this time. But, your site is just refreshing to the same page and not showing the revise form or something to enter any details.So, i left the message in FY2013-2014 page, But till now i did not get any reply from HnR block. I am not even sure whether anyone got my message notification.I m thinking to go to other sites or auditors for the last year. Your response is very good for the current Years. If the same service is provided for ITR revise also, it will be good for you to maintain your name.  
Highly recommend engaging with HR Block, this not only saves your time but also helps you understanding your tax computation, this team is well engaged at work and had shown good gesture towards clients.Keep up the good work, Tax computation and filing was never so easy!.  
None  
I am filing my ITR with H&R block for the last two years. Its really a good experience. We don't need to worry about anything while filing an ITR. Their tax experts are really awesome and very professional. We only need to provide all the information from our end and the tax experts take care of everything.I am not sure about their charges as both the times, I filed my ITR through my corporate account and it was free for me both the times.Overall, it was a wonderful experience. In future also, I would be thinking about doing lots of business with them.  
great job loved it  
It was hassle free and convenient to e-file my return. Thanks H&R Block team for the support.

It has been good experience with H&R block  
Userfriendly services  
ok  
I was really happy at the speed at which the entire procedure was completed without much hassle to me.  
H & R block is a good initiative & really helpful. However it will be better if it can give more tax saving advices to its customer.  
Excellent service!  
Good explanation to queries asked by H&R personnel.  
Dear all,One of the best site for income tax return filling. HR BLOCK advisor are too good and friendly.Thanks bala and team.Regard,Pappu.  
the H & R Block is very simply advised and completed tax return without any query. also guided me simple manner and made me under stood  
no comments  
I did not receive any TAX saving advice, but I would like to receive them in the future. Good service  
The User Interface on the website is probably the best experience. I keep on strongly recommending the service to all my friends from various industries in Pune.One important suggestion :- There is a strong constraint of target of 2 days for the Tax adviser to respond to the online form uploaded from user. According to me, this time limit should be revised to a more comfortable one , say 5 days. This will allow the adviser to remain more relaxed and focus better on doing the assigned job. In any case, i don't see much value in filling the tax in 2 days when we have the deadline after 2 weeks.In the last week from deadline, the same service can be made chargeable and in that scenario, the tax advisers can be given extra premium for the extra load.This suggestion is to make overall system less loaded and more enjoyable to both -user and the adviser.  
The response is quick and communication is very good  
The service was awesome, I could not find any faults. Further, only thing is that we are not able to view the message or response from your end. It would be appropriate if you could kindly improve (only if required=as I may be wrong also). I wish the H & R Block Tax Team all the very best!  
Really appreciate the speed & clarity for processing documents.Thank you.  
Your telephone lines are not good enough. The voice is very feeble and sometimes it got cut. Please improvise it.  
It really simplies filing of your ITR procedure. You don't need to do anything. They take care of everything. Great experience with them for the past two years. Will definately continue with them.  
H&R Block is extremely easy and professional service provider, highly recommended.  
Yes, this is good and fast service which is provided by H&R Block and I would recommend everyone to use this site.

Mr Sagar, very efficient & was prompt in his reponses. Great Job. Good assest for the department.  
Very good and quick service.

Happy with the service & Expertise of H&R block.  
Senior consultants of H & R block (Tabassum) helped me resolve confusion on NRI rules applied by Indian govt , Dutch - India taxation laws & made my e-filing procedure a lot simpler than expected. H & R block is an extremely professional organization & I trust the advice from their experts.

Your service is really much appreciable and I am extremely delighted to have associated with you for my Tax filing. It was really smooth and effortless.  
Tax consultant Niharika was very professional and helpful. She was very polite throughout the process.  
I don't want to rate negative but i would like to convey the true experience Kashyap assigned on my tax thing and he went on leave then Akshay helped me alot for him i would like to rate 10.. i have filled the form for my mom Mrs. Usha Gupta on which piyush assigned after his multiple attempts ... in return i have multiple attempts to reach him but failed finally i have filled the return on my own. I have asked Akshay to arrange a callback on my Landline number but didn't recevie the call on time. i have left couple of message to piyush to call me on land line but didn't recevied the call which irrates me and dissatisfied me.  
If possible, please involve the client also while computing Tax to help understand the process better.  
Very good and fast Only 2 hours  
Though other things have been very good, there are some discrepancies in the steps mentioned to submit the ITR-V through e-verification, especially through 'Net Banking' process.... It missed a point to mention 'Generate OTP by EVC' and its way to find it in the Income Tax Portal... I had a tough time finding it myself and finally e-verifying my returns... There might be discrepancies in other areas too... Hope these will be corrected soon so that others don't have to suffer... Better to make it more simple and clear...Thanks.  
Never thought tax filing could be so easy, I have skipped this for its complications all these years. Hardik has made my work very easy and I like this idea of h&r team. Thank you..  
Excellent Service. Thorough professionalism! Just provide the documents and information required.. they will get it done! You don't need to worry!

its a amazing experience with H&R Block for their prompt and expert advice.  
No idea  
Its very user friendly and timely solving all financial scenario.  
The Tax advisors at H&R Block India were fast, friendly and effective. The turn around time was so quick that it felt as if I was filing my own taxes. It was over all a very stress free process. They also kept me informed of the Electronic Verification that was recently launched. It was a great experience and i will definately recommend that people use it.  
H&R Block India was introduced by my employer M/s Tata Motors a few years from now and since then the life has become peaceful and comfortable as far as tax return filing issue is concerned. H&R Block India charges or fees are highly reasonable and free in some cases which is customers' delight.Thanks to H&R Block India and team.  
Great Service.  
Very good & effective website for easy tax filling. Thanks to H&R Block.  
I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of service provided by H&R Block online tax service in India. It was as simple as signing up at their site and uploading the relevant documents like the Form-16 and within a day my work was done. The only delay was on my side since I had to talk to my employer and a few other entities to get my documents. From H&R side I had excellent support form someone named Tejprakash Sharma. He was quite knowledgeable about the whole process and answered all my questions quite fast.As an NRI and having no experience filing taxes in India this H&R online service was a great help and made life easy for me. I would recommend this to anyone who is new to Tax filing in India.Rating: 10/10  
The promptness and proactiveness of my advisor (Sowmik) was most welcome. And the overall process and guidance was very helpful.  
Its a great tool to submit Income tax return.Thank you  
My assigned Tax Advisor was Mangesh. Then right before my ITR V submission, my case was being handled by another advisor who said that mangesh wont be available. I was transferred, kept waiting. I would appreciate if such incident occurs, atleast I should have been informed. That was clear mismanagement on your part. Other than that, service was swift.  
Follow up / remainders to customer, . Information to customer regarding the various ways / options available to file the return are really appriciable  
Have already recommended this to many of my colleagues :)  
It was a very good experience in dealing with you guys specially deepti who was very calm in explaining the procedure for return filling... Cheers for her and Team...  
The steps to submit the efiling can be more descriptive..for ex- you can show us steps by using arrows symbols etc. We had to search for certain options which were not given to us directly. Rest is good..  
I have been filling IT returns for more than 2 decades now. For the first time I found very smooth and effortless Return filling with HR Block. Expert concerned were very courteous and highly professional. Surely I will recommend to my friends.  
Good service....value for money.  
Wants advice still not clear on few things which wants to know.  
I was very happy with your service, at the moment, no suggestion from my side.  
The timelines seemed to be amazing...thanks and keep up the good work!!!  
Good.nothing can be good then it..  
Good support regarding advice & IT return. Keep it up  
One Advice is, Services of HR Block are excellent. I have submitted by Form 16 online as attachment and I have not received any mail until 10 days, that the Form 16 is not openable. So, If you can intimate it asap, it will be easier and better  
Service is extremely good.  
NA  
Very Professional service and valuable advice  
Its was quick and easy.Thank you  
Really simple n fast. Thank you  
It was wonderful and extremely user friendly website.  
this is one of the best way to fill up the ITR  
Firstly, it was great experience. I got my return filed within time and got the refund within fornight. But it seems the refund which I got is less what I was expected. I had not claimed for the rent I was paying in my company and it was around 80k. So the refund which I should get should be more than what I geo. I dint get the calculation.  
My dedicated Tax expert was very helpful and courteous.  
Very easy and friendly to talk to. Mohan Singh has been very helpful.  
Experience is really good with H&R.-- Very quick in doing the tasks-- Very informative & suggestive-- Very friendly as wellCustomer care connectivity is a not upto the mark. Had to call couple of times to connect to some agent.  
Extremely happy with the service provided  
The entire process was very fast and extremely easy! On top of it all, it was FREE!  
The service was prompt and excellent.  
Found little expensive.  
I think the tax advisor was not clear initially - Initially the return was prepared based on some assumption and later they had to change the type of IT Return form and have return prepared again.Also you mention that we will hear back in 2 days - but it never happened. I had to manually call and follow-up multiple times.  
keep up the good work, thank you  
I have been a constant client for H&R Block. I am really thankful for them for providing such an easy and cost saving facility.  
Good Service  
It was excellent support and hassle free service. How ever I was not sure that H&R will do everthing, I spent some time filling forms which was not reqruied.  
Good Service  
I did not get any tax saving advice, you need to inform yor advisors to give that without asking.  
Thanks for helping on this and letting me know the return amount as well.It was very easy to file Tax on this site and user friendly too.The Tax expert helped on this in no time.  
This was a great experience. I used your services for the first time and am absolutely delighted. The tax return was filed without any hassles and my queries were answered well. Please keep up the good work! Hope this level of service and customer satisfaction continues :)

H&R Block online service is very much user friendly. We can easily submit form 16. I did submit my ITR last year from H&R Block. And while filling this year, it automatically took all the details filled last year. I am impressed with the service from H&R that is also free of cost. Thank you H&R Block  
On Tuesday, August 11th, I received an email from H&R Block India that my tax summary statement for FY:2014-15 has been prepared and uploaded in my login account, I logged in and somehow inadvertently clicked on the link to e-File my IT returns. I called on 022-3003-8111, spoke with a Nishant who said he will arrange a call back from "my Dedicated Tax Expert--Sagar", within 45-mins however got no call so I sent an email that evening only to receive this reply: Hi, Informed your concern to respected advisor. Regards, Archana Pathak. First time patron and not at all happy with your services.

Great Experience. The tax expert Nishant was very friendly and helpful. Kudos to him and your entire team. Well Done.  
H&R Block tax advisors demonstrated adequate knowledge. They also responded promptly to queries. The transparency in their operations was something I liked. The facility to connect with the tax advisors via phone or email without the need to visit their office was also very useful.  
H&R block is user friendly, but if u provide more facilities & more opportunities like giving a brief description on what ever u have provided till date. if u add more also it will be so helpful to us & providing a brief description of exactly how this H&R block will be useful for all the employees & if u provide some key points step by step it will be easy to understand- what is H&R block & what r the benefits for employees with this H&R block. As a employee I have seen so many employees are raising questions. before sending this if u provide for what H&R block if for & how it will useful for each & every employee.

Good service - Thank you

its very good experiance to submit my tax return through H&R Block  
Great Job!  
Yes I would appreciate if your executive take initiative to call the client for any clarification instead of waiting for the client class you to find out the status on his file.  
1. Its impossible to reach the tax advisors assigned to us, even though you provide the phone no and name. 2. I used your services last yr and this yr. Both times, I ran in issues and had to exchange a few mails before fixing the issue. I am expecting that your advisors are pretty good hence I ideally shouldn't have to bother for corrections.  
Service was really good & Fast !!  
I Really appreciate your effort,Services r really awesome Keep doing good work.  
It was great experience. Nikhil helped alot as tax advisor. I forgot to claim my HRA of previous company and he pointed that out,which assures they do care about quality of work.  
Great service!!  
Nice service provided. I only need to upload the Form 16 in HR site and they did rest of other work. I am extremely happy with the services they provided.  
I was unable to view computation of total income using Review tab. Also more clarity is required for EVC code generation through internet banking, may be with some example will be better  
It would be nice if you can provide tax saving advice.  
no  
There should be a facility of live chat with tax expert,so many times unable to reach to tax expert as your phone service waiting time is too much and it takes long time to connect to tax expert.  
Excellent online Tax Services. Pace and accuracy is quite good.  
H&R Block Advisors are really expert and provided me valuable suggestions in my tax filling. They are very friendly and knowledgeable. They can answer any of your queries with patience. Thanks for H&R Block Advsior. My special thanks to Kamlesh who helped me in filling my tax returns.

You are Excellent  
Tax filing in few clicks.. Awesome...  
one email with all relevant details and a step by step "to Do" list.  
- Prompt in responding to queries- Could have been little more careful when filling up the data.  
In case one does not call from registered mobile number it is difficult to reach the tax expert as service desk quality is very poor, staff is neither communicative nor competent. Pls look into this on priority  
The service is extremely user friendly  
Tax saving advice ,if given ,would be appreciated.  
you are quick to address customer needs. keep the same pace.  
It was very smooth and received timely updates. You guys rock !!!  
Good  
Excellent trun around time and expertise. keep up the good work.  
As a tax computing firm , it would be great if you give out flyers at times to your clients about probable tax saving options and revised news on taxes. Not aware if its already on the go but if so then great job guys :)  
Thanks  
The advantage of H & R Block good service can be taken by maximum tax paying employees  
Great! and simplified service.  
Quick resolution is appreciated  
Quick and easy process. Instant feedback received from the tax advisors. Much appreciated  
The Service is very good.  
thank u  
Very Quick Service  
When you say that E filing is completed only after verification with below option and no options being desplayed we will be clueless uless we ask any one experienced. I expect every thing should be self explainitery anUser friendly (Portal)  
Last three years have been extremely useful, professional approach of H&R is truly praiseworthy  
Service from HR Block was quite fast and all information required came quite handy. The message response system was quite nice, when HR block advisor responds a query then instant message gets delivered. Really good service

1. Kindly includes Online/direct chat option with the Tax Advisors. Then it reduces lot of time and ITR can be filed in short time.2. No option to review actual filed ITR, now details are displayed in H&R block format and if the consultant/advisors made any mistakes, then it goes unnoticed .Regards,BG  
Very good service, a small advice have reduced my tax amount.Thank you!  
My experience with HR Block is very pleasant and I am very much thankful to HR Block for a guided support provided during e-filing process.

I am amazed by your prompt service and personalized attention! Tax filing was never so effortless. Now only if you could take it a step ahead and help me in optimizing my tax-savings during 2015-16. I have been informed that you have tax-planning services as well in your service offering. That makes H&R Block a complete one-stop package for all my future tax needs.  
I would appreciate if the tax expert call and provides us the feedback rather than posting the comments.  
I really appreciate the work done by you guys, and also like the way with which you personally take pains for the clients.Good Job. Keep It up.  
I felt the UI was very simple to work through and Rohit who was my tax advisor was very friendly and professional.  
ITS AMAZING...WOW GREAT SERVICE STARTED ..I HAVE NEVER SEEN THIS KIND OF SERVICE..  
The consultant was always availble on the phone and the speed with which the filing was done was stupendous. Will come back again.  
Excellent Services. However, one aspect of DATA privacy remains as a concern. Trusted HR Block for that this time.  
very good!!!!!!  
I like the most point about HR block is hassle free, very friendly, proactive/instant help by call/chat as per our convenience.suggestion is you can mail/assure in written by explaining that beyond this value we can't save tax.  
Comments on tax saving can be of more helpful.  
Good Service  
My Tax advisor DevKumar was exteremely good and always had a willingness to help natured. Way to go Dev !! Keep Rocking and I am sure you are an asset to the organization.

Incredibly fast, secure and a customer focussed appoach in resolving my concerns during tax filing make H&R Block a winner. Can surely vouch for their personalised attention based on my experience of 3 years.  
So far I have taken your service for filing IT returns. So I have the following feedback on this service only. Provide a flow chart in your portal explaining stages involved in filing returns before start of the process. Also do provide advises on saving taxes while speaking to clients. Also it will be very good provided in your web site with big flash messages.

H&R is the best thing which has happened to corporate word. Thanks  
Initially I had contacted the Pune office. Priyanka was giving me information but she was little loud and so did not find her courteous and polite enough. In addition, the info she emailed me had some other client's personal info which totally turned me off and I shifted to Bhavesh Bhatia in Mumbai office who did our family's 3 returns.  
Good service. We are in 3rd year with HRBlock.  
I am happy to your services....thanks to HR team  
My tax advisor was very helpful, really appreciate Sumit's efforts.Kudos to him.More than his work I was touched by his behaviour.  
Thank You H&R BLOCK, You made my work very easy for tax e-filing.  
your tax expertise are very friendly and quick responsive. I really appreciate it.  
Manual computation is old process. Portal should auto-populate all fields from form-16  
I was E filing my returns for the first time and H&R block made it very easy. I give full marks for H&R block and would also recommend to others. Excellent service.I am curious to know if H&R Block also guide us on paying tax for specified income every quarter or H&R block only provide service to file returns at the end of the year? Do H&R Block has Tax Adviser or CA who are specialized, to whom we can contact to guide us paying tax for all income like capital gains, shares etc  
Good job;thank you.  
good  
The complete service and interaction was fantastic and that too free of cost was delighting enough and would recommend anytime to ALL my friends and family, in fact already started doing that and they might be using your service.Thanks a lot !!  
I wished your tax expert could have given more income tax saving tips rather than only filing returns. I used to file my returns online at least from 2010, (if i am right). Looking forward to receiving some tips some how to save more tax than Form 16.  
Excellent Service  
It was super fast and efficient  
Highly recommended. H&R makes the return process so much simpler.Had a little delay and had to contact multiple times as your experts were on leave. Had little bit of hard time there but overall extremely satisfied.  
My tax Return was filed within few minutes. The Advisor PUNITA herself contacted me got the relevent information and also advised me for Tax saving. Ultimately I got refund of Tax of Rs.9000/-.Every Tax payer should grab this opportunity.Full marks to H&R BLOCK.  
Prompt and friendly staff.More feedback required in relation with tax savings.  
Instructions to EVC needs clarity - I did spend some time trying to understand how to proceed with it. Finally found an answer myself. If this information was shared clearly upfront I could have saved couple of valuable hours.Overall experience has been good. Thanks to Mahima for her support.RegardsMahendra  
Good Exprience  
Very Quick response  
The Online Personalized Service and contact by phone is the best feature introduced. Please let us know the Charge ( Price ) for the service so as I can personally recommend it to others.Note :- As mine was thru Corporate A/c.  
This made the tax filing so simple. Great service with a personal touch! Cheers!  
Many thanks for the timely help.  
Please list down tax saving things in the portal itself.  
When I asked for the necessity of printing ITR and posting the hardcopies, I was not informed that the same can be done over the internet.Finally, I received mail from your team and I filed over internet. Anyhow, the paper-less is always good and printing of my document could have been avoided.  
Really appreciate my tax advisor Apeksha for her valuable help and time in the process of filing the tax. I would really like to refer my peers or my friends to use this block for filing their IT returns also prefer Apeksha's name for them.Good job team !!!  
For a change, it was really good to speak to the advisor assigned. She was extremely courteous, polite and understanding. Good in following up as well. Thank you.  
Very good and very easy helpful.  
Excellent service done in timely manner. Thanks.  
Excellent Service.  
Thanks Diptee for all the support..Keep up the good work..  
I really liked it!  
Overall experience is very good with H&R.  
I am very happy with the ease of communication, quick response and personalized service offered by H&R Block. Thank you !  
H&R Block gives me simple and straight solution for my Tax filing and other computations which previously I couldn't deal with.  
The speed is good  
Made my tax filing extremely easy. Thanks to the team!  
Good service provided by H&R  
The response and care from your members is too good. Keep Going. Good Luck.  
Service provided is up to date and prompt, instant messages received through sms and email, clear guidelines provided what to do and what not , that is most important. This is what i like here. Keep it up.RegardsVaibhav  
Some descriptions should be provided for the initial questions asked. For ex: the other sources of income, there should be some description on what all options mean.  
Great service. It was so easy to file tax with H&R block.  
Very very good.  
I suggest that tax adviser responds to our query not by sending default messages. Answers should be specific to our questions. And , it would be better if we get call from the tax adviser for quick resolution.  
The services provided were excellent. Prompt responses were received without any delay.  
Your service is awesome. You are fast and accurate in filing the tax. I'm extremely happy with your service.  
no as such  
I'm an IT employee and it's been 2nd time this year I have filled my ITR through H&R Block. It is an extremely good initiative taken by the team. I like the services & very convenient. It would be good if we get some suggestions from experts to save taxes.Good Luck & Keep the services continued.  
Thanks a ton to H&R block. The tax saving advices are really useful for me. Thanks again..  
Excellent  
The only thing that I think is not good is the ability for the user to change his/her responses, and data. I think the online form could be improved further to provide details like investments, HRA details, other income details. This would greatly help user and will reduce a bit of work for Tax advisors as well.But overall it was a delightful experience.  
I am happy with the H&R Block services.  
Experience was delightful.Five stars from my end.  
Really appreciate Husna Khan, the tax expert assigned to me. Was a very smooth filing process overall.  
very simple and easy to understand process  
As of now the 2nd part (like not required to send the hard copy of ITR V to CPC, Bangalore)is looking bit complicated though I have not tried out yet otherwise it is good to have such sort of help.  
I received the calls from various Insurance companies. Just wanted to higlight that pls dont share any personal information with any third party. This will help your firm to establish more trust and credibility.  
Just wanted to suggest that for existing customers you could provide them the option of selecting their agent. Maybe they have had a good experience with the previous agent and want to continue with him. For example I had uploaded docs for 14_15 and 13_14. Out of tis 14_15 is completed and 13_14 I haven't received any discussion calls etc. Speaking to 2 different agents at the same time may be cumbersome.  
If more options can be explained to customers on discussing tax then that will help customers understand more on saving tax. Here its just asked what more documents you have, instead you can inform customers how are the ways you can save tax  
Excellent Service with proper guidelines  
It's really nice being a client with H&R Block Tax Expert.  
Filing ITR became very simple on using H & R Block Services. I didn't need to face any issues or troubles while filing ITR. Everything went so smoothly.Thank you H & R Block

nil  
it was good. Just a small hiccup that initial statement created was having error. which should have been checked carefully. But the staff was polite enough to understand that and get it resolved SOS when I called. So just be careful while filing, otherwise it was not bitter experience for me. :-)  
Thank You  
Good  
H&R Block is simply superb  
Executives are prompt, friendly, and have good knowledge about Tax.  
I need tax saving advice and try to plan itr in advance to avoid the last moments hassle  
Your tax adviser needs to do "work". Most of data was supplied and corrected by me. even though he had all documents uploaded.  
the really fast revert. Excellent experience :-)  
The Tax Advisors are extremely helpful and they know their job really well. I am extremely delighted with the way my returns was filed and they helped me with the applicable clauses to get maximum refund.

Aniket explained and helped in completing the tasks step by step. I am extremely happy with his support.  
Never expected that it would close in 30 minutes when we saw that lead time is 48 hours. Sincere thanks to Amit for closing this in less than 30 min.  
My Tax Expert Talagadadeevi was awesome, she followed up with me at each step and helped me file the taxes swift  
Excellent Sevice  
Thank you for prompt and fast service provided.  
Appreciate the calls your agent had made to ensure all my queries are clarified and that I do the necessary payments without crossing the last date.I would request the H&R Block team to let know the various other ways one could save other than 80C.  
One of the great network to manage our Tax.

The efforts made by the executive is valuable and was really helpful. It is a very good initiative and saves time.  
simple and elegant  
I feel KPIT Tech and H&R Block have done amazing work to make our life easy.Tax filing was never so easy before. H&R Block process was easy and excellent service. I would definitely recommend it to my friends.Thank you.  
I was supported by Rahul and was extremely happy with his support, he was very friendly and was guiding me thru the entire process.Thanks H & R block for your wonderful service  
Very prompt and timely service and good user friendly website developed.  
no  
No  
We have no other option other than phone number to contact the tax advisor, if there is any email contact that would be great.  
Support and guidence is excellent.  
The website can be made more user friendly e.g. the section to send message is bit confusing, time taken to upload files, couldn't change the option of filing tax return with the help of tax expert  
One point contact of designated tax expertise, extremely fast support from tax expertise.I could not imagine that return filed ina single day without any hurdle. thanks for great support and service  
Good & Quick Services  
Quite satisfied with the prompt and personalized response.  
Good support

Very good service provided for me and turn around time also good.  
Excellent service...  
NA  
Great Service and Tax Advise. Thanks H & R block.  
Excellent service !!  
Its all good! Still it can be raised if H&R guides us after analyzing the uploaded documents for any possible tax savings as per several regulations (where one can get savings). Many times we are not aware how we can get additional benefits. There should be some consultation.  
good  
For person like me who is almost illiterate in finance world, the service you provide; make my life very easy for critical work like IT return.  
The service provided was flawless and quick. You guys are fabulous!  
My tax advisor Sushant was extremely helpful and prompt. A similar service ouside with a CA would have cost me anywhere between Rs.500-1000. Here it was free of cost!! Will surely recommend H&R Block to my family and friends. Thank you for the no nonsense and hassle free service.  
good service  
Good Service. Thanks.  
Friendly yet professional :-)  
I specially like H&R Block step by step online process and quick turnaround time to serve you.  
Its great filling ITR with H&R block, over all it is good experience.  
I did it for the first time . Didn't had to interact with executives of HR block so can't give much feedback . Its quick and hassle free .  
Too many emails - nearly spamming my inbox. You can surely cut that down. Apart from that, very very useful.  
Sometimes we are not able to reach the consultant instantly so please improve the connectivity.  
gr8 service  
It was a good experience for me  
It has been a great experience working with H&R Block team. I am impressed with their commitment to ensure I would able to file my tax return on time. Their website is also very easy to use and designed keeping user experience in mind. Thanks.  
Really Satisfied with the way I was served. Kudos to YOU ALL!!!!  
Incase of bank FD interest under TDS category which is more than 10% charge on applicant, then your portal dont have facility to pay from H&R Block India site.  
Virbhan was really helpful and went out of the way to guide me and file my IT.  
I would like to specially thank Vishwesh for his time to handle a scenario wherein there was a mistake done from my end.He was very patient in his approach and provided appropriate solution which helped a lot.Thanks H&R team for your support :)  
I would like thanks them for the services provided timely.  
HR Block folks were good, prompt and professional. From an improvement perspective I guess a sort of more automated interface which shows up the data associated and flags requirements such as proofs would help  
In the world of service industries; you just ROCK with spledid & timely responces without any "WAITING"Kudos to team; happy to recommend and strated so..Delighted to associate with you..!!  
Hats of to you all! It was a pleasure interacting with you. Great customer experience and total satisfaction. I am your life long fan.

It helped and eased our Tax returns to a great extent by saving lot of our time.  
The best thing about H&R Block is your constant effort to help your clients.  
I was delighted with the service provided my Ms. Rimal Ajmera. She has an excellent attitude and truly understands the value of customer service. It is refreshing to experience this quality that most Indians have yet to learn. Without good service, a customer will exercise his options to look for some place else to take his business. Pramod Dave.

I got frequent updates regarding my Tax return from H&R Block team and got prompt reply for all my queries.Overall my Tax return process went very smoothly with help of H&R Block team.  
I found it more mechanical interaction without any personal touch. The way it is advertised on web, I didn't experience anything of that sort. Didn't receive any tax saving advice etc., it was just filing the return.  
Nice service and very good initiative.  
Nice interaction and simple process to file return. I will refer my colleague for this website.  
Great job! Keep it up.  
I am impressed with the ease of filing my indian IT return thru a professional even when I am based out of USA.The response from the H&R tax consultant,who was a Chartered Accountant was very useful and prompt.

Given the complex Indian tax laws, the website and advisor were friendly enough to process our details easily and efile quickly.  
Best service of H&R block impressed us.

Amazing Service. Keep it up  
You people are wonderful.... completely hassle free tax filing service.... Thanks a lot for the support....  
Please make your website more user friendly. At some pages its hard to find to go Home page. We have to use backspace for previous page. Shouldn't be like that for enscripted sites handling confidential clients data. Thanks for all help provided.  
The speed of response is very good and impressive and it being free of cost :-D  
People on the team need to be effective communicators. The person I dealt with could not speak english well and could not communicate well what information he needed and in what format. I understood his requirement after a couple of questions I asked.I would not mind if he spoke in Hindi or Marathi. However, communicating effectively in less time is important for me.  
The process was so smooth (I had to fill-in few fields and one document and everything was readily available for me. Extremely good service!  
Thank you for your good service.  
Happy with the Super fast processing and guidance.  
Your team is doing excellent work, please keep it up for ever...

This is the first time I tried online assisted tax filing and was very happy with my experience. All the communication can be easily done using messaging/chat system. All the documents can be securely shared with tax advisor by uploading it to the system. Tax advisor is helplful, polite, knowledgeable and patient. He is quick to respond to my queries and answers them diligently to my satisfaction. Overall I was happy with the tax handling was done. However the cost is slightly on a higher side as compared to other sites and this is one area which might need improvement and might draw more clients to H&R.  
Really appreicate the quick response to Tax queries raised. Keep up the good work. In addition to Tax return filing, please see if you can extend your services on other income tax concerns too  
System is good & Robust  
Quick response was the best part of your service which admire most

Highest marks to the friendliness and prompt and relevant replies of my advisor Mr.Shankarsingh. Right from the initial moment, I felt that he was genuinely interested in helping me. Kudos!The website design is simple, neat and to the point. Especially for people like me who are not good over the phone, the asynchronous Messages (and the email reminder to the same) is such a blessing. Combined with the the helpfulness of the advisor, most of my fears of "dealing with tax" slowly went away. It speaks very highly of your organisation that you refused to take money (the fees) when things were not yet clear from GOI end - even though I wanted to get that part over with. Really, this kind of gestures builds a lot of integrity and trust.  
excellent and fast services, Looking for the same quality service in the coming years  
Very prompt response from Mr Sugar my tax expert.  
Excellent communication with proper response.

Excellent support  
Great Support by Durgesh at all the levels...thanks  
Extremely prompt expert advice though an easily maneuverable site made an erstwhile cumbersome process, a pleasing experience of Tax returns  
We had to initiate the entire deal as given adviser was extremely busy with other files may be and which i really did not like about your services. We had to make the calls to and we did not receive any call back from you as you promised.There seems to be no facilities provided to your advisor, as he was not able to call to my husband's phone number for more information on our tax file. They should be provided with facility to make work related out bound calls at-least.Not only that your fees and charges are very high it should be really less then currently you are charging.  
This is my 1st experience with H&R block and i am very much satisfied with the timely services and commitment .  
Very good service - quick , effective & informed

Do tie up with corporate to get the regular customers. Also, personalised assistance is very useful.  
First time with H&H Block but a 100% satisfied customer, Keep up the good work !!!  
Best thing that I have observed is continuity of communication and one single place of storing my IT related documents. This is something I had missed in past when I used to file my return thru a CA.  
I would love to see a save your tax do it yourself in this which allows me input my sal details and create ta forecasts and also lets me know where I can invest further to reduce taxes. You can also have general investments tips.

Your website is not user friendly. All other are very good.  
Once the E-filing is done. I would propose the the tax expert to take it forward and do the posting as well rather than asking its customers to post.this is the only thing i have.. rest, you guys are doing really good ! :)  
"My tax advisor at H&R BLOCK, she was exceptional! I was impressedwith how regularly she followed-up. I will be working with H&R Block again !"

Thanks again and looking forward for your service next year.  
When a customer calls & the my "PERSONAL" advisor is busy & you conveniently disconnect the call at least bother to call back

If once I uploaded any document and I wanted to delete or removed due to wrongly attached than (delete tab is available but) I can not delete or remove it.  
Best thing I like with this H&R Block is the response time and the communication.

Xecellent  
they should be more friendly  
Its a simple and very effective tax filling. You have to upload only form 16 and rest all things HR block is doing. Along with this HR Block should give tax saving related tips so that the tax payee will have an idea for next finacial year about investing.  
Akshay , my tax consultant was awesome  
NO  
Nicely framed website, ease of access and input method, quick/instant alerts on sms and email, quick response on feedback, overall a very good professionally managed website and excellent service.  
You people simply calculate the tax to be paid on basis of input given. Its should be your responsibility to tell that adding these things can save your tax. For ex, if a person does not have any saving tax is deducted from his salary every month, then why he has to pay huge tax again ? you simply calculate, you must approach the guy and explain how it can be saved.  
You have got a very easy to use system.  
pl.guide us how to save tax & also can i get refund of some amount of tax .Thanks  
I am completly satisfied with the services that H&R Block has given.Thank you so much or such a wonderful guidance.

very Good services provided by H&R Block.  
Hi,First of all, thanks for the hassle free experience.I have one concern regarding the whole process of your organisation. As the Form 16 is password protected, when we upload it, you asked for the password as well. But later on, in the site, I saw the password is still visible for me. It would be great if you could work on this issue.Thanks,Suchetana  
I am really happy with the efficiency of the tax advisor who assisted me. The process was quick and simple. I play a huge role in the customer service industry and I found the experience very satisfying and professional. I would definitely recommend H&R Block to my friends, relatives and colleagues.

I received beyond expected service and advise from H&R Block advisers, trully impressed and recomment others to use.  
The tax consultant considered my request to re-file my return after I gave additional information. That was delightful. Filing tax return with H&R block has been such a nice experience, it has been two years now. Hope to continue for many more years. Thanks a lot.

I loved applying it through H&R Block it easy to simple steps and if you don't know just call the Tax expert they help on time. Over all great experience. Best part was ITR-V form submitted through E-Verification.  
Prompt reply and good advice for a novice Person in filing return  
NA  
Might need to make some good bonding with customers explaining them about how securely / confidentially you are keeping the customer's sensitive data (Form-16 or whatever it may be).  
The simple and smooth process of filing of IT returns made me visit H & R Block website for 2nd year in succession. Add to that it is FREE.  
You guys help us file tax with amazing speed and ease. All the very best.  
The tagline itself says Your Tax Expert. Really true!!!  
Really liked the way the process works. From creating my account, easy to understand questions, sms/mails on progress with a go to person & timelines kept till completion . Thank you so much, its excellent.  
The quickness and accuracy is a great deal. The simplicity in the online activity is very good.  
Amazing!! I appreciate Hema for helping me with great patience and doing a continuous followup to complete the efiling. Great job!!  
Over all the service and response is good and appreciable.  
The support was awesome  
I am surprised to see such a wonderful and nice services you are providing that to at free of cost or very low cost.Mr Varganti had given me nice services.  
I would like to highlight one point that will increase customer satisfaction.When I ask more questions in one message, I get reply for some and then I have to ask those questions again which were unanswered.You may want to train your staff to read all the queries raised by your customer and then reply to all. If they do not have answer at that moment, then they should address the query by saying they will get back by a specific time.This little attention will make a big difference in customer satisfaction.  
H&R Block has helped me file taxes with ease and breeze . Thanks for the free service also :)  
Good, keep it up :)  
Service is prompt.  
We both (my wife & me ) have filled the tax through H&R but Your representative could not correlate initially & could not suggest any way out for reducing the tax burden. I had to coordinate with the different agents with H&R to get what I was expecting.THis could have been improved.  
The H&R block process is very simple,smooth,secure and very fast, service advisors are very helpful and skillful.  
It’s very easy and convenient way for filling our return with zero fee. They are assigning dedicated person for each individual from analysis till e-file. The follow-up is also good. Totally awesome experience.  
Very fast and proactive service,Some advice or the options to save taxes would be more apriciable  
My income from bank interest was omitted and the return had to be revised. Other than that, Mr.Rahul was very prompt and helpful.  
Service was so good. I was getting the response on the time. But one thing the tax expert has been assigned to me. Once I am done with my details. But until I contact them through message for the first time. They didn't gat back to me and I started getting the tax advice from other expert instead of the person who assigned to me. Rest everything I felt really great.. Thanks for serving.  
Representative with whom I spoke is friendly and he listened to all my questions carefully and prepared the tax summary. Tthanks H& R block  
Not Exactly, You guys are doing great work.  
Excellent.  
Extremely pleased with the service provided. For the first time I did my e-filing with minimum issues and maximum satisfaction.  
Tax saving advise could have been given.  
Filing the tax returns for the first time, it was very helpful of H&R Block to assist at every step right from the beginning to e-Verify. Highly Appreciated and will recommend to all friends.  
Bhushan is an asset to HR Block, very efficient and man of word. Thanks  
Hi Team,The service was good. I would suggestion would be to have a session with the tax consultants and the tax payers every half yearly once. So that the consultant can help the tax payer saving tax with his/her suggestions. Once the year is over its in neither of the parties hand to save and the payer is always unhappy to pay, its pretty inhuman. So please arrange similar calls or email chains during September month by assigning tax consultants per tax payer/employee or however it works.Thank youRgrds,Subhransu PadhyVMW_333451  
I love the promptness, ease, intuitive and crystal clear process. Very impressive.  
It's really a great experience. H&R Block made tax filling easier than ever it was.

Very good service... Quick response... very good in communication regarding requirement... hassle free ...  
Awesome response from H&R Block team, timeline mentioned as 2 working days but I got the response from the same day. It's saves lot of time.... :) :)

I am very glad that i have used H&R Block for e-filing my taxes for continuous second year. Very good and prompt service experienced by H&R dedicated tax expert.Good, fast and reliable work team...!!!  
Service is very good & fast to the customers.  
I contacted HR Block on 28th July for filing my taxes and uploaded my details. The tax advisor called me next day and took clarification on phone and sent me the computation in 30 mins. My ITR filing was done the next day without any hassles. The experience was sheer delight for me particularly when it feels a pain to do the computation by yourself. Here is an expert service on which you can completely rely and take advice without any hesitation. Highly recommended and do not look anywhere else.  
NA  
I feel the suggestion on more tax saving should be suggested by advisor  
I have not been given any tax saving advice , I don't know the reason may be it is not applicable for me. Request to share tax saving advice if applicable to me to save tax further.  
Nice and fast service..:)  
This is an awesome service for employees like us who don't find much time in understanding how to prepare the tax computation. H&R block team has always helped me in understanding each and every part of the computation patiently and advised me on tax savings. Overall very happy to use this service. Thanks again for the flawless and easy way to file your ITR.  
Good job  
it is very good service provided for me  
Liked the user interface and friendliness of website.If you want a quick and reliable solution go with H&R Block.  
There were no questionnaire sent or questions asked to prepare the returns. I checked the other service without tax expert and it has good set of questions to guide through the entire process. Bottomline - Assisted service is waste of time and money.  
It would be good, if any tax saving advice is provided.  
The speed at which the process done was excellent!  
The return was e-filed within a timely manner suited well with clients timeframe.

The advisor has helped me in tax filing and has explained the process as well as guided me on tax saving.  
The service was quick and very good.  
The tax advisor can provide suggestions to clients to invest in certain areas to gain tax benefit than just merely submitting the form. If a particular client is not interested then you do not have to provide suggestion but many would be willing to take help.  
Excellent service in all the parameters and always I used to get prompt response from Tax Expert. Thanks for the awesome service.

Over all services are excellent however I would have been more happy if I would have got the advice on my tax saving  
the system & the concept is very good & very very helpful. thanks to all team.  
if u have little flow knowledge and didnt know how to do that ...these guys will help you great..  
very cooperative and right guidance  
H&R block is good but I already know, how to e-file my tax using Form-16. I have 2 months of salary as a contractor earlier where I do not have salary breakups, I asked for the advice of HRA, conveyance, medical bills, etc for that period but no help provided for that as they ask for Form-16 of that duration. So, I have filled 2 months of salary without any HRA or conveyance or medical deduction due, which is not financially good for me as almost Rs.1500 tax deducted from my account.H&R Agent was very friendly and helping but he unable to resolve my 2 months of salary breakup problem which I actually looking to be resolved. However I like the service but Agent need to continuously contact us if we face the problem and try to resolve it by consulting the senior accountants.But still thanks for your help and agent support. I like the service and wanted to recommend it.  
Simple and easy process for filing tax  
Thank you very much for prompt & fast services.Frankly I was not expecting such fast service.Pl. keep it up and good luck

Prompt service. Easy access. Timely follow-up.  
Service is good of H&R as per my experience, only one thing I felt that you guys should except scan copy also of ITIR.

Extremely Professional organization and quick and prompt services!!

It was a 10/10 experience, till the tax calculation was completed. However, could not make the payment and file returns as the formalities at Govt end was not ready.Missing part was, " I did not get a notification stating, now you are ready to accept payments and filing returns" I noticed this through one of my random login.  
Excellent Service

Wonderful job!!!  
You should provide other assistance also like helping people with understanding their income break up and then help them plan the investment. When I asked for this service the person referred me to different site. Those sites are available to everyone but Indian tax system is so complicated that its difficult to really understand every bit of it. I was hoping someone to help me understand the tax deduction happening  
Fantastic, not just on money saving, also on allocating a dedicated tax expert, what can you ask more for?  
Flawless process & Quick service  
Everything is perfect. The prompt reply and prompt filing of taxes  
Experience of uploading information and data on website was very friendly.  
Tax filing had never been so easy.. Thanks H&R.. :-)  
Very nice site  
Effective, efficient and easy for people working anywhere in any company..service i used used 2nd year in a row, definitely recomended  
The tax saving advice should be more elaborative.  
Need improvement in online document submission, as it is bit confusing for the new user.  
Response was very positive and quick.Hope this will continue in future also.  
First thing is it's completely free and moreover you guys call us and give assistance, which is very good.Really liked it guys.Keep up the good work.  
the service and the process of communication established was excellent.  
This is my second time, overall a very professional and excellent experience.  
Thank you very much.  
Unlike other Tax Filing website, H&R is very use to use. Easy questions takes you through the process of filing.  
Small one. Earlier i used to send 1 copy of ITR to the CPC in Electronic city Bangalore. Now i was asked to send 3 copies to your address in Pune. There was no reason given for this change. And also i had to spend Rs.135 for the inter state courier.  
tax saving advise would be welcome. Also, maybe you guys can start video chat etc. Would also be good to know the profile/experience of the consultant  
There should be a provision to sign & upload the ITRV form on the H&R block website and be done with the procedure. Being re-routed to government websites and following other procedures is a bit cumbersome. Hope you folks can do something about it.  
It was easiest tax filing i have ever experienced. Great team!!  
I am associated with HR&Block since last 3 year. Very customer friendly approach. I received all updates within minimum time with personal touch through mails, SMS and calls. Queries were resolved on same day. Thanks. Wishing all the best !!!

Need to fast... Since I have applied on Saturday. but took one Week. Hence need to completed with 2 or 3 days  
I felt that the response from your end was too fast and it was good.  
No.  
Ashwini has been extremely prompt, friendly and patient in understanding. Some level of work is still pending, but still I am tempted to give this very positive feedback.  
ok  
Keep up the good work, it really helped me. I never though that filling ITR could be so easy and hassle free. Would appreciate if real time chat could be available so that it becomes convenient to interact for both tax payer and advisor.  
You guys have been amazing and with me having 2 Form 16 this year I was quite clueless on how to go about it and you guys have saved me the pain. Especially assigning an expert with whom you can talk on phone and get things sorted is an ideal option.It would be nice if you can come up with an option to have it posted as well. I am sure a lot of customers have never visited a post office and might not have a lot of idea as well. Obviously at a nominal fee that you would be charging  
Personalized Service is what impressed me the most.Keep it up .  
Excellent service.  
Its really nice that Tax problem solution can be solved by expert. :)  
I would recommend H&R Block to penetrate PAN India companies, individuals for filing tax return; considering the ease of dong it thru H&R Block. By this way, it will do a great service to the Nation.  
Very good Service.Tax filing took in few click thats all.  
Excellent Services,H &R rocks

It is wonderful experience to get my IT returns filed through your organization since last year. Hats off to your team  
NA  
This was a cakewalk and the tax advisors are also very helpful.  
Direct numbers of the tax advisers should be provided to the client so that the client can reach their tax advisers easily and quickly.Thanks!  
Great help and assistance. The assistant was clear and was asking details in common man terms and was very very helpful. It was easy and smooth filing process. Adding that extra.. (free of charge) is big customer satisfaction element.  
The UI of H&R block site is very simple and easy to walk through. Good to have a contact assigned for any query  
Teresa is awesome  
Being an Oracle Employee, I experienced a hassle free service from H&R  
I Really appreciate the timeliness and the steps in which my form 16 was processed as it was done within 24 hours while keeping me updated for each steps and received appropriate notifications where my action was required.  
Communicate with the customers using only one email id either official or personal email.DO not communicate with the both emails which leads to confusion.Also rather than sending an email saying that I got a msg in secure chat box.I'd like to get the msg in the email itself so that I can save time  
Priyanka Sharma was very helpful throughout the whole process of filing the return. Her responses were very prompt.  
Fantastic Service!! It was very easy process and one can efilehis tax returns without any difficulties. Great work team:-)  
NO COMMENTS..  
Thank you for helping with the Tax submission.  
It was really a great experience to file my IT-returns with H&R block. The dedicated tax advisor was always there to respond to the question/queries I had and to guide me in successfully filing the returns. Even If I was unable to reach, the advisor use to try and contact with alternate methods so as to ensure the information is correctly communicated, which is the good part of my experience.Would like to recommend to anyone who is new or old in filing returns, trust me - It is going to be a simple and smooth experience.  
Lot of disturbance while speaking with Tax advisory, Noise pollution  
They worked in timely basis to provide me ITR-V form. The website is user friendly which has made my overall ITR process simpler than any other portal.  
You made tax filing buttery smooth and simple. Thanks a ton.  
HRBlock made my tax filing easy and after following the instructions given to me i was able to link my Govt Bank account with e-filing and got the acknowledgement online without signing and sending the same to Bangalore office.  
H&R Block team is very transparent in following process and gave quick & detailed response to all my queries.  
My Tax calculation was wrongly calculated and told to pay more tax then actual, i have to again consult the CA to do calculation and rectify it and pay him as well.  
Hi Team,80G part for my filing, was personalized, explained and processed effectively..it was surprise to have a free service so fast and simpler.I have already shared many of my friends about your service.good job! great experience.Regards,Shyamala  
Pretty neat User Interface.

You rock !!! Keep up the good job.  
The process of Tax filling was user friendly and also the process and execution of Tax filling was very fast.  
No... Keep up the good work  
The service is good. I got timely reply through email for my queries and able to submit also just in few days.  
the personalized service and guidance was just too good.Your executive Niket took the extra effort to educate me about the tax rules as i am a naive at understanding any tax related rules.He really went the extra mile to help me with my return, plus the turn around time was very very fast.Although cant say the same about one other claim that i filed for fy13-14 (managed by some other tax expert from hrblock), 6 working days and still awaiting for the e-file to happen. (Maybe an isolated incident).but overall a big thumbs up.  
Keep up the good Job!!!  
Team were real quick to respond along with self-explainatory responses. Really appreciate the experience had in filing my return.  
Prompt response. This is appreciated.  
It's a very user friendly site with minimum user interface the entire process was completed with in a short span. I liked the way the team has responded and finished the activity asap. Thanks to HRblock Team  
Thank you for the quick help in efiling my Tax returns accurately and i can say it was better than most of the online websites we choose for this purpose  
Excellent help for novice tax payers. Extremely fast, accurate and friendly service. Well Done!!!  
As a novice, i had no idea about this whole ITR process. H&R block really helped me a lot to file my ITR in this assessment year(2015-16). So i would like to recommend H&R block to all my friends who are struggling with ITR filling.  
As of now no, will suggest in future if any one is there.  
That was a really quick service! Thank You!  
Speed of work is very good.  
Thank you for the prompt service. It's rare to see such commitment to the client. Keep it up!  
It was a great experience with H & R Block as it became very easy for me to file a return while taking expert advice from the tax advisors only by submitting the Form 16 However, request you to directly file the return instead we posting it  
The service is excellent.  
Really appreciate the quick response from the advisor on the chat and on call too. Really appreciate (my advisor - Dev Kumar)  
No compromise on service.  
I like the speed of process and proactiveness to update my filing status. Appritiated.  
One small improvement is - even the return is free lastly website asked me to pay Rs 3/- to file the return. Either its bug or something else. That has to be checked.  
The service was excellent.  
Service is very nice. Well done & Keep it up.  
GOOD & FAST SERVICE,Thankyou........  
I don't feel that H&R is lagging on any part. For regular customer please maintain fees of Rs.200/-  
I am really impressed with the effective communication of HR block tax experts with their client. The reply to the queries we raised are acknowledged and adddressed very quickly by HR block tax advisers. The updates are send regularly. It is really a hassle free service. Thank you.  
I had submitted my returns through H&R Block last year, I was very happy with their personalized service. The executives are very polite & friendly in nature & as they say, they really provide personalized service. I would definitely suggest H&R Block to every professional for Tax returns filing. They are really Good.  
I received prompt responses from H&R block and they helped me to file income tax returns with very less effort. Thank you!  
Receiving more mail from your site, couldn't able to recognize the important mail. Some confusion happened in my last tax filing. As per the guidance in my login i took print out and posted to IT dept, after that got a call filing not happened, waiting for my confirmation.

I was happy with the Quick Response  
Service was good.  
The experience was smooth, well designed web interface. Please highlight (change color) the circled-down-arrow on "my accounts" page, it should stand out as documents will appear upon clicking it. Also, the login box should say I have to enter email id. Thats my suggestion. Thanks.  
If tax experts proactively advice on more tax saving advice after seeing the form16 like (LTA, Madical etc..).  
Nice service. It was very quick. Due to the proper calculation and also proper checking by the Tax Advisor Hitisha, I came to know that excess Tax has been deducted and i will be getting refund for the same... Thank you Hitisha and H&R Block...  
Gud work!Keep it up!  
You must suggest in which Policy to invest and which policy is more important and why during present Market Risks.  
Simple and relevant questions to individuals was good. Unlike other vendors who ask all questions (business, farming, foreign trips) which are not relevant to everyone.  
Awesome Work. I never thought it would be this easy.

The ease of filing is the single most important parameter. Being a Tata Motors employee this facility is free. But had this been a difficult process I would have not done it from H&R block inspite of being free. Tax Returns filing is a important activity.

No other improvements required, Shiv (tax advisory) was very helpful.  
None  
Though I has paid huge amount of taxes this year and I wasn't knowing the fact that I could pay the tax initially and later claim refund after submission of investments documents, which I could have done to save taxes. The tax saving advice has really saved around Rs. 12000, which could be more if I would have known such facts. Great advice by your team, which I will definately follow next year. Thanks for your advice.  
Were quick and well informed.  
Please provide (client view)the demo or any pdf file to understand the total process to your clients. So that they can follow that simple things to do...  
Token of appreciation for kritika  
I found your team quick in response, and website really easy to navigate through your through out tax filing process and my interaction with H&R Block tax expert gave me confidance of error free filing of tax returns. Thank you !!!  
1. The first thing that I like is that you do not push any products (insurance, "tax advice", etc.)2. You could make the e-file page linked with your home page. There is no link available from the e-filing page to the rest of the pages.  
NA  
I am having Demat account with ICICI direct, hence I got the benefit of free e filing of IT returns by your org. I would request you to extend this benefit to my husband Mr.Sampath Menon for filing his IT returns free. Could you pl revert on my email address. Thanks. Maheswari

Excellent Service ! I have never come across such great experience before . Will refer H& R Block to maximum people.  
The assisted e-filling option was exactly what i was looking for since i had very specific queries which were answered in no time through your well trained advisors. Excellent service. Really quick response times as well. Will certainly use this service every year.  
Excellent work... Keep going ..  
The other aspect I would like to highlight is the effective communication over emails and it has been a fantastic experience.  
Your person Pawan was very courteous and professional.Had thorough knowledge what he was talking about. Never showed any haste and worked very good with me.These are the type of people who make an organization proud.Thank you so much Pawan.  
Overall this is one amazing experience. Gone are the days where we had hassles in getting this done and sometimes even missing to do it because of the same. Thanks for the wonderful experience.  
The advisor deepti approach of explanation is very nice.Keep it up.  
service provided by H&R block is very good  
I am yet to explore your services so I would like to know how are you able to help me save my taxes. The cost of your service is reasonably ok but customers wants more added benefits or some offers or discounts. India is all about something "Free" or "Extra"  
Excellent and I would like to tell my family members from different companies...  
Remarkable job done by Gaurav and Shitanshu Dubey.  
If you can creat a live chat feature just in case any query we can chat and get it resolved instantly.  
You guys should keep live chat option and even kind of planner to preplan my investments to save tax under the sections. You guys made tax filing simple.  
The tax expert allotted to me - Avinash, was very prompt in responding to my queries and he e-filed my return without any hassles at all!Thank you H@R block! :)  
No comments ..your are doing good service  
Excellent Service.  
It was very simple.. just upload FORM-16 and rest H&R BLOCK guys will do.. Thanks keep up the good work...  
well supported and timely answered.  
Very professional, brief to the point and very prompt  
Its was fast and it was very helpful from so many years. Thumbs up to you guys.  
Great service, timely process without hassel.  
User friendly.Just upload Form 16 then sit & relax.They will take care of the rest.  
Your service is really good and also I would like to appreciate "Hitisha" for her swift response and advise.  
The resoultion and response were quick and immediate  
I am pleaseantly surprised to see fast, accurate, personalized tax filing.  
Extremely good service, Using from past 2 years.  
The return filing services are excellent and you have a really friendly and responsive staff. Tax experts are there to listen to your doubts and clear them as well and not just file return and forget. I have received help understanding various deductions/exemptions related to individual taxpayers. Only one issue I have is that for the same category of exempt income u/s 10(16) of the Income Tax Act, your two tax experts have different views and hence one has filed ITR1 and the other ITR2. I would like to get this sorted out soon. Overall, highly recommended services provided by you guys. Thank you all :)  
I am extremely happy. Will definitely suggest my friends to avail this service.  
Very user friendly and very easy way to filling.  
I felt bit ashamed. Such a great service and no need to pay ? Thanks So much  
Excellent job..keep it up !!  
It was perfectly done  
Keep it Up !  
It was an amazing experience .First time I did not feel that I am filing the ITR no complications no wastage of time in asking people regarding what to do what to fill.Thanks a lot H&R Block for helping and providing such assistance.  
It was the easiest Tax filing I did and I received the ITRV so quickly. It saved me a lot of time as I could do it at my desk and avoided a lot of running around. Thank you!  
Thank you and keep up the good work.  
just improve the message alert signs. One has to go into "message history" to see "new" message. It doesn't sound relevant.Anyway, keep the good work up.  
I liked the quick, clear & accurate response I got from you.  
I have already informed my friends to use this service. Hope going forward the impression remains the same  
quick service/responses

Thankyou so uch for the wonderful services.I just would like to add a point here,It happend with me like when the concerned HR was trying to reach me he was unable to reach me on phone and when I am trying to reach the tax expert i am facing wrong number.Soughting out this issue will help the customers more.Thank you once again for the services provided.REgards,Vasundhara  
Tax adviser communication skills were not good and he was no able to communicate the things clearly. Details in the ITR forms were filled incorrectly and i had to ask adviser to correct them again and again (more than 2 times). There should be a online real time chat option.  
Hi Team,Since, I did not get any tax saving guidelines . I wpulf request you to please call me on 9886030631 to provide me some tax saving guidelines. it would be a great help from your end.Best regards,Yogesh Patel  
Good all-round service  
Thanks.I like the follow up procedure.keep it up.  
Husain (Tax Advisor) was extremely courteous, helpful and did extend his support on additional questions/clarifications I had. Please request you to not restrict tax return help for 2 years only - If any help for years prior can be provided- it will be additional value add than other competitors in market. Thank you. Regards,Sameera Siddiqui  
The prompt update at every step is a delighter always  
It is really easy and hasslefree service.. Thank you so much team  
Thank You  
E filing was so fast, within few minutes it's done after uploading Form 16. Great Experience.  
I put my comments into the Home Page but i didnt get any response/feedack. I appreciate if any adviser call us back,Thanks  
Some flash player operated example demo or video can be attached for First time or new tax filing peoples. It will help them to understand under which slab they fall and how to file.  
Got good service from the Team. They are very Informative and will respond to our queries very quickly...  
NA  
Consultants are very friendly and quick in responding. I find the website very good and user friendly. Best part is all my tax details including the important documents are all in one place,I can login and refer anytime I want. Great service!  
It will be beneficial if your tax expert talk to the client before filing all the details, so that can avoid the repetition for details filing.  
Excellent support  
Fantastic work. Zero hastle in filing your tax details.  
Hi, I had a good experience with your organization in filing the return. I am thankful to Mr. Bhushan (Tax Advisor) who was patience and helpful in guiding me to complete the e-verification process.

I am a client of H&R Block since 2014 and thanks for your continued free tax returns service. One difference I noticed from last year to this year is advising the clients to sent the ITV-R by post to IT department, instead of keeping drop boxes in my office premises as last year.  
Quick and prompt service received.  
The process is very simple and anyone can follow the process of tax filing. Thank you for your service.

I think present practice is OK.  
Tax Advisors are good on co-operation , however they are not available on phone . I got auto answering message , thrice , when I dialed " advisors are busy and they will call back " I got a return call only once. However they are really good on knowledge !  
Deepti gave extreme support while filing of the IT return  
keep up the good work :)  
the observation is whenever I have called to your tax expert/adviser on your numbers, the adviser was not available to attend, the call was diverted to service centre and they are not able to locate the tax expert or pass on the message. I have to left message on chat and wait for the tax expert to call back. This is very irritating.  
I can say your services are Extreamly very very good and fastest.  
my tax erpert Ms. Ritika is very good. within 2-3 days of time we have finished all.  
it isover all nice experience

It was a good experience to work with tax expert of H&R Block.  
There was no response for first 2 days as rep assigned as on leave or something. I had call to check what happened. Later they acted upon on my file. Atleast if they could drop email or call to intimate if there is delay for whatever reason it will be very good to know.

I never seen such a great care & passion with other service providers from the past

overall experience is great, confirmation received on time and processing was very fast and clean  
Very good expertise service  
Good Service.  
No..was gud experiennce to fill my Tax through H&R block.hasle free.  
Services is very good.  
Easy to approach and available when you need them is the best quality any service provider can have. In the age when you have to press 1 to 9 many times just to talk to a CSR, H&R Block advisers are are just a call away. Highly recommended.  
Good Service, thanks!  
It was great to have you to file the taxes, potential of becoming like google in the TAX filing Industry.  
Good service.. Keep it up..  
Better communication system is required Bcoz frequent on line visits become tedious rather than hassle free service or a truly online service. Further a contact number of advisor for at least one to one talk should be one area to be looked into to create wow factor.  
More than the e-filing the personal assistance provided be it either by phone or through great website messaging service, I would say its first of its kind and I would definitely continue with you in future even for an annual fee  
I like the entire automatic process followed in H&R Block. This time I have done my Income Tax Return happily without any Manual process.I would like to recommend to my friends also.Thanks H&R Block India Team.  
Amazing timeliness. Hassle-free & Simple. :)

I have been using H&R Block for e-filing IT returns since 2 years and it has been an awsome experience .Best thing is that you get advices from the Tax Experts on how you can save Taxes and get more returns . The process is very easy and the experts are very prompt - be it via messages or via calls . Truly Satisfied with the services !!!!!

Overall H&B Block was very helpful is my IT returns process. The rep personally followed up with me multiple times until I approved on the final returns to be submitted. Thank You  
Good job  
Its amazing that a personal tax advisor is allotted to every client. But I think for cases where tax filing do not involve complex computations and returns, but just a simple filing, the process can be automated without the need for a personal tax advisor. That would make it even more swift than it already is! Thanks for the powerful experience!  
Very positive approch service -- It will be easeier for the people.  
Based on client's positive feedback, Please don't charge for basic tax compliance services in future also for income only from salary and you may earn your revenue by charging for services which include income from other sources as well.  
Good service  
Very good experience with H&R Block. Really easy process to filling the ITR. Wana just request you to save the client information. Thanks.

if you can you provide the drop box facility in office premise to drop the signed ITR-V acknowledgement forms, that would be great help for all employees.Thanks in Advance.Razi  
Process steps need some more improvement.  
I loved the fact that I was only involved in uploading the Form 16. Rest all was automated and taken care off. However, some of my friends to whom I referred the service had problems with their Form 16 being automatically read and uploaded. Why so?  
Will be great if you can suggest any tax saving advice  
Excellent service....once you upload form 16 ..everything is done...also the site is very user friendly...cheer up for H&R Block Tax Team....  
The services are very quick and the whole exercise of filing returns is very good and hassle free.  
Specially I would like to say thanks to Mr. Nitish for his great help towards tax filling, its explanation, follow up and acknowledgement. It was really nice experience with him to file a return. In my 14 years of Tax filling I never felt so comfortable like this time with Mr. Nitish.  
I am really delighted by the service you provided. I will recommend to my friends  
Tax consultant was very friendly and I really appreciate his service and the timely response.

I only concern i have is As per ITRV if form is prepared by a tax expert then TRp details need to be furnished. I would request if you fill these details while e filing the Income tax return then we can directly send the ITRVAcknowledgement to CPC Bangalore address.

Best Service providers for Tax filing  
HR Block is of very ease to use. It takes less than 5 minutes to complete our work. Most of the items I was getting quicker response. less than 25 min which is fine. Only sometimes, rarely I was getting a late response that is also around 6 hours range only.  
Thanks for filling my tax. The process was very convenient. I have missed filling income tax return of year 2013-14. I would like somebody to guide me what all docs are required and how shall I proceed. If someone can give me a call to understand the same , then it will be great !!  
It was a good experience.  
Its very easy to fill.  
To make sure confidenicial.  
It is very easy and quick way of submitting the ITR-V. An overwhelming experience.  
I have received good support from H & R block for submitting my income tax for two years with good advise. I would like to continue and refer this to my friends.  
Nothing. Keep up the good work. Thanks

Income tax fileing is very fast and east. Thanks for the personalized help.  
Its an excellent service with ease of filing tax without hassle  
Tax advisors need to be more communicating and responding immediately to any request. Currently I find the response time is quite high.Similarly, your EPABX system is quite lengthy and the people who answer those does not respond positively. Instead of transferring the call to the concerned advisor, they would ask you to call back. This is bit irritating.  
Thanks for your valuable service.I haven't got any Tax Saving Advice from your side, so hoping for it in future.  
this is very comfortable for all of us who are working women and very good exp., don't close it.thank you:)  
Great experiance with H&E Block, Its so easy and user friendly..Thanks H&R Block...  
This time I noticed in the view summary and filled form details - it should not be done and all customers docs should be uploaded to customer profile after verification- you can probably make a docs reviewer person for such activities at your end, then customer can verify. This way accuracy level will increase.  
Keep doing the great work!Thank You!!!  
Thank you very much for you support! Hope you will keep it up! :)  
The advisor was very much helpful to submit my IT.  
H&R block representative Vignesh provided good tax returns for me. There were certain queries which were clarified and later included in the tax returns. The advise related to the payment of the tax as challan was useful and hence the new return was provided thereafter. This is good completely online tax return service.  
Keep up the good work always. All the best.  
Great support by him, thank you.  
Excellent service  
Please give the Mobile number of Tax Adviser, which will be very useful to client and in line with advance technology.  
Its a pleasure dealing with aadvisors and a relief from taxing botherations.  
As long as you carry same sincerity, you deserve all appreciation.Thank.  
First of all I would like to thanks to Ms. Gaargi who has always support to me time to time to fullfill the ITR.Request to H&R block , pls give a call / miss call to concerned person for any updation or put some information on site regarding ITR form becoz most of the times SMS or mail could not be read on same time.  
I am a customer for 3 yrs. Based on income and tax would like H&R experts to provide tax saving advice at the start of financial year and customers like me would like to avail such a service by paying a consultancy charge.  
Excellent Service!!!!!!  
It was really amazing. This was my first ITR filing, my colleagues and friends were telling so many stuffs which i couldn't even understand. H&R block made it a cake walk for me.  
I am extremely happy with the simplicity of your system, which does not require further interaction or clarifications. I am also happy to see that you immediately nominate your tax consultant, who responds within 48 hours.As an improvement in your system, when you first login, there are three blocks, which don't say what they are for. Through trial and error, you know the first is for company email ID and second is for password. Improvement, is a pop up against these blocks.I could not find edit button on second login, for modifying data uploaded in the first login.I am a satisfied customer.RegardsMauro  
Good Service  
Keep up the good work, my Tax computation was done without many questions asked and timely response over the chat & SMS. My ITRV is with IT office now in less than 36 hours from the time of contacting H&R Block. Thanks for doing this job for us in our hectic schedule.  
Excellent Service! Saved lot of my valuable time  
Please continue the same.  
Very helpful, hassle free tax filing. Did not even come to know that the ITR has been submitted..it was so easy..grt work..thanks  
Easy and Simple process  
You are doing a great job filing Income tax returns free of cost, thank you so much.  
Its a very good service with quick response.  
very nice and professional service provided by H&R block  
I am glad to say that your help is needed for us, please continuee to do the good work.  
service is very good  
FROM LAST FEW YEARS, YOUR SERVICE IS TOO GOOD ANY SOLVE SO ANY PROBLEMS OF CUSTOMER. PLEASE MAINTAIN THIS.  
Your filing system needs to be more robust and flexible .. eg an user who was using H&R block assisted services is not allowed to switch to DIY services using the same user . For using DIY the next time , user has to create a new account . Flexibility for a user to switch between assisted services and DIY must be allowed .Secondly, to view the message that is posted by the advisor user will have to go via "continue to e file" button ; ideally it must be flashed at the home page itself .When reviewing and submitting finally , the web page goes blank. User has to logout and login to get the message that the ITR will be processed ...Lastly, additional info on secondary bank detail and aadhar info are only optional , but I was forced to share those info . Please ensure that only the required data is collected and the website is more flexible and powerful.  
After ITR E-filling quick processing for the next Step with further information & guidelines.  
Thanks for the excellent support. I would like to take help for every year tax filing. Please share contact details so that I can advise my friends also.  
It was really a nice experience to e-file ITR through H&R Block. It's hassle-free, friendly and satisfactory and the response is very speedy. I was able to e-file my ITR within hours.Thanks to H&R Block.Feeling delighted!  
It was a real easy to file ITR. good and friendly service.  
I could not locate any areas for improvement as my experience with H&R was good and hassle free. Great work!  
Great Job. Keep it up.  
Please refer to the communication trail for my account. If this is the standard you take pride in, I have no further comments.E-filing without having to send physical copies of the ITR is a unique feature this year. I had to point this out to the advisor, who then acknowledged. Advisors are supposed to give advice - not just acknowledge and provide short answers to questions. I will certainly not recommend H and R Block to any of my friends outside work, as I don't want to expose friends to sub-standard services.  
This service is really good benchmark and serving client to its fullest strength with sincerity and trust. I have reffered this service to many of my colleages who also like the hassel free tax filing.Thanks for brillient service.  
The service offered by H&R Block is amazing.

You guys have made tax filing an easy activity.  
I would like to receive any suggestions from your experts regarding my tax file in tax saving, as we normally are not aware of all the sections where we can actually save the tax.

Would appreciated more advice on tax saving.  
Good Service  
See,service is good but thing is there was no co ordination between me and tax advisor,like what message i was to give him he was to reply complete different ans,it was like i was exchanging messages with a computer,in end i had to call him to do the work which also he did half of it,so i was like let it be because it was not a big,i just wanted to add some more detail in my itr,which he didn't understand i guess even after writing msg or telling on phone.Just a small feedback,otherwise service is good i have already asked my dad to get his return filled with you guys,so i am recommending u guys.keep improving gd luck.  
You can have a talk to the customers regarding the tax saving tips and section related info at the starting of financial year itself.So we will be prepared.  
My interaction with Vaibhav, my Tax Advisor, was most friendly and helpful.  
You Can Launch a Digital H AND R Block Android / IPhone App to make it more easier and advanced. I was totally satisfied with the service provided to me and i had saved a lots of time bcoz of H and R block also can send us the regular updates happenings in tax or tax updates of salaried employees.  
The service is very fast and good.Its very simple.  
Some selections for a Retired person living in own house are confusing.

Execellent Support and user friendly interface. Delighted getting your services.  
You may guide us regarding systematic financial planning at the beginning of the financial year  
H&R block may publish the document types which may results in maximum amount of tax refunds, so that tax payer may submit them to the H&R Block(if they might have missed earlier due to lack of knowledge)While filling up ITR infront of an advisor, we may get few tips to getback tax returns for the current year. But while filling up it online, we will not have this opportunity.  
You are the Best  
I am good with the service provided , quick answers from folks after a question is posted. Improvements required are- website not full user friendly. - have an online chat with executive instead of sending mail and receiving answer after sometime.  
Keep up the good work guys..  
The response was very prompt from my tax advisor.  
Great Job :)  
provide link to avail your tax processing services for individual business persons and self employed persons.

I got my tax filed in no time, extremely user friendly platform and process.  
It will be good to have an email address (can be a group id) to communicate with the tax advisor. It tiring to find the comments link every time on the site and then read and react to what the Tax expert is saying.Thank you!  
Your service is good and i liked the way you treat the Customer by explaining indetail

No suggestion  
The service that you guys gave me I felt very delighted, quick response & helpful suggestion. Even your employees are awesome and friendly.  
Great help, You have made my tax problem small.  
The Service is god but it can be more better if the tax advisers present a choice of other multiple tax saving methods to the clients.  
Im not sure but thing that since there is a tab for name of the TRP who has prepared the IT, there name and details of the HR block should be filled. Also there should be some tab to write that the same if filed with the tax company, as it says in our salary that its system generated hence no stamp or sign required.  
Thanks really very nice service.  
One word to you - Fantastic. And your executives - Mr. Amolkumar is super and warmest ever in this era of increasing online support. Highly recommend your service, and a big thank you!  
Just make sure that your right hand knows what your left hand is doing, there is still lot of scope to improve on effective communication.

1. For filing of tax returns the trigger should come from H&R Block especially for old customers like us at the right time.2. Based upon my current returns filed there should be an investment (Financial Planner service) offered for us.

Pretty much satisfied with competency of advisor and ease of process.  
It's amazing experience with H&R...I am glad to mention that entire ITR process was completed with just an upload of my Form 16 and most amazingly without any cost...

I have been using this site since two years. It has made my ITR filing really easy. All I have to do is update my form-16 and relevant documents.  
H&R Block should work out on possiblities to understand in depth awareness of customers to their own Finance in tax perspective and services offered.
