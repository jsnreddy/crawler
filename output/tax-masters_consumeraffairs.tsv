I contacted Tax Masters about my IRS debt in 2012 and I was quickly told about their services and I asked them why they were not part of the BBB accredited and they said it was that BBB was away to charge company fee. Well they lied about the BBB and they lied to me and took $1500 from me and never did anything after receiving my payment. They never called - I tried for the past 2 1/2 years to get money back.
Iâ€™m writing on the money that I gave to this company and I would like to get my money back because you never did the job you were going to do, to fix my IRS - my add is **, then you as well here is my phone number **.
I paid $1600 for tax help but they did nothing. We got our bank accounts levied for $6000. We tried to get our money back from Tax Masters but no luck. I resolved the tax issue myself.
My husband and I are behind on our taxes, and I have made several inquiries with the IRS to re-instate my payments. Anyway, I had fraud on my checking account and then their automatic payments did not go through. Regardless of that situation, I started receiving threatening letters from the IRS. I was overwhelmed by the threats that I contacted Tax Masters to see if they could help me. Being vulnerable, they gave me a rundown of their services and it was through a Michael **. I thought this was the way to go, so in the midst of everything, I gave them a deposit of just over $1,000.00 through a debit transaction over the phone to get started in the process. In the meantime, they emailed me a contract to sign, which I never signed. I spoke to my husband and he was furious that I went that route. He told me to call them back immediately, cancel the debit transaction, and not pursue with them, because any company that asked for money upfront before they do anything is a scam. I called and sent cancellation emails the next day. Finally someone got back to me and said that they will have to review and if I qualify, they will return my money within 60 days. 60 days well passed and I received an email today stating that after review, I was not entitled to get my money back because administrative fees were well and above the deposit I left per contact. I did not sign anything.
I contacted TaxMaster in Jan 4, 2110 to assist me in resolving my 2007/8/9 IRS tax issues. They were quick to provide me all the necessary paper works. I completed them all and mailed it back to Mr. David **. He quoted me for a total fee of $1900 payable for 3 payment. I paid $967 for my 2009 return only which was completed in Apr 2011. They claimed they can't help me with the 2007 and 2008 because I've already made an installment agreement with IRS and will be refunded $933 in 30 days. I made several phone calls about my refund, but was given the runaround instead. I was referred to Ms. Crystal **, Finance, (**, ext **) in-charge of refund. All my calls were never returned. I would like to have my refund immediately. I was promised 30 days since Apr 2011.
Tax Masters led me to believe that for more than 5 months they had been in contact with the IRS helping me to get my interest and penalties lowered. I paid them upwards of $3000. I had a hard time getting them to return my phone calls or emails, and the few times I was able to get in touch with someone, they assured me they were taking care of everything. Wasn't I surprised when I had a knock at my door and found a man whom had a certified letter from the IRS stating they are going to take action, drain my accounts, come after my home, etc. Everyone's worst nightmare. I needed help and I needed it fast. My neighbor whom I trust with my life explained how he had gone through tax issue the year before. His experience was much better though. Tax Relief Foundation had taken him from wage garnishment to actually being owed money in one month. Would you believe it? Things started happening when I contacted Tax Relief Foundation too. What a different experience. I was never pressured and always assured by their professionalism. So to make a long story short, Tax Masters did nothing but rob me of $3000. The Tax Relief Foundation saved me.
Tax Defense Network is no different than JK Harris or Tax Masters! I was originally ripped off by Tax Masters with a sales pitch that promised me an offer In compromise with no results and an up front fee of 5 grand! Well, guess what? I called JK Harris and got the same answer to my tax problems. Did not trust it for a second. So I kept looking for a reputable tax company. I called TDN and you know what? They told me the same thing as Tax Masters and JK Harris! Five thousand dollars for an offer in compromise that I knew darn well I wasn't qualified for. Finally, I got help from Dave at US Tax Liberty. He didn't try to sell me but told me exactly what was up. And then told me they can't even quote a service fee until they contact the IRS and find out what can actually be done with my case. His number is xxx-xxx-xxxx, if you still need help. There is a simple rule to find a good tax help company. If they try to sell you with a reduction right there on the first phone call with that fee right away, then stay away! Tax Defense Network, JK Harris, and Tax Masters are nothing but scammers!
Do not go with Tax Masters! I was shopping around for help with my back taxes so one of the places I called was Tax Masters. They are nothing more than a bunch of shady sales people. They told me that my tax liability could be reduced by over 90% and quoted me a fee right then and there. It's complete **. I did some research on what they were talking about and the IRS even has a section devoted to companies like Tax Masters **. I ended up finding US Tax Liberty. These people are reasonable, and don't lie to your face, which is what I like from a firm I'm going to do business with. If you do need help, I suggest you check them out.
After our daughter died, Lars stopped working and started drinking. He ran his own construction company out of our house so we were living comfortably at the time. I didn't have to work and we had plenty in our savings to last us a while, so it seemed obvious at the time for Lars to take some time off. Months turned to years and our savings started to run dry. So I started to work again as an RN. I didn't know it at the time, but falsifying information on our returns to maintain the lifestyle we had. In reality, even before he stopped working, his small business was running at a loss but he wasn't claiming most of the contracts he was receiving on the returns. This didn't matter to me at the time, Lars was driving back from the bar and got into a bad wreck. He was in a coma till last year when we finally decided to let him go. On a different note, I was starting to receive notices from the IRS that they were going to levy my bank account and garnish my pay if I didn't pay the back taxes I owed totaling in $300,000! I called up Tax Masters after seeing a commercial. They told me through an Offer in Compromise that they could reduce the liability to only a few grand. So I took what I had left in my savings and paid them the $15,000 they needed. How could they steal from me? They knew what I was going through and they did nothing for me. Six months after I paid them and never got any status from Tax Masters, I called the IRS who told me no OIC was ever submitted on my behalf! How? Why? I paid them fifteen thousand dollars and got nothing! After I got ripped off, I was referred to David at US Tax Liberty (949) 999-3308. He heard my story, put me on hold, we filed an "innocent spouse claim". According to US Tax Liberty, I did qualify for an OIC and if Tax Masters had filed the forms, I would have been approved! But I didn't need an OIC! I don't know why they would rip somebody off like that. It only cost a few hundred dollars and US Tax Liberty had the garnishment removed and liability dismissed in less than a week. Now, I owe nothing to the IRS. Why would Tax Masters take advantage of somebody like that? I don't understand. I'm over trying to get my money back. Just please don't go to them. They will only hurt you like they did me.

To begin with, my wife was already ** that I hadn't saved up enough to pay our taxes for that year. I file 1099 every year, so that means I have to save my own money to pay my taxes every year. And well, in 2007, I fell short. I only came up with $30k which was only half of what I owed for that year. in 2008, I managed to come up with the full amount of $70k to the IRS, but they applied $40k of that to my back taxes. So with penalties and interest, I was falling even further behind. This didn't help the matters at home at all! So when I paid up my 2009, the debt I owed the IRS was up to $50k. And the $900/month payment plan the IRS put me on was not helping. So I contacted Tax Masters. After speaking to one of their "tax advisers" on the phone, I felt much better. They told me what I wanted to hear. I was told that Tax Masters would reduce my debt to only $1,000. Ha! What a laughable lie! I should have known that it was to good to be true. But I bought it! And it was only going to cost me 9 grand! At the time, that seemed more than amazing--only ten grand to pay off everything! That was when I had to start sleeping in the office. Tax Masters advised me to stop my payment plan, because now they had contacted the IRS and were handling everything for me. Not only did I constantly receive letters from the IRS, but 3 months later, they slapped a lien on my home and my wife slapped me in the face. Yes, I messed up in the first place, being late on my taxes. But Tax Masters took my money and did absolutely nothing, except ruin what was left of my relationship. I was still hopeful however. Maybe Tax Masters would be able to get me out of this mess. I called them up and guess what, they said there was nothing they could do for me. After frantic searching and calling multiple firms who all seemed to promise all these great things up front just like Tax Masters, I then came across settlewiththeirs.info which explained to me that there was never any way that I was close to being qualified to an Offer In Compromise. But they did get me back into my house, when they removed the lien from my house! My wife cooled down after that. They did a tax investigation immediately and let me know that my tax debt could be reduced but only to about 20k. Currently, I am on a monthly payment plan of $400/month. That is more than reasonable, and don't worry, I already have everything saved up to pay my 2010 taxes. The rep at settlewiththeirs.info suggested that I try to get at least a partial refund back from Tax Masters. So I called them. Do you know what they told me?! They said that I was not entitled to a refund because of all the work they did for me. What work?! They filed an OIC, and that was their cost. Bull. ** Filling one form does not cost nine thousand dollars! Does anyone know how I can get some of this money back? I have my tax issue resolved. Thank God. But I want my money back! I've seen some people on here are trying to file a class action suit. How do I get involved in that?
I hired Tax Masters to prepare 2 years of taxes (2005 and 2006). I paid $2500 - $1000 for preparation and $1500 for "negotiating and settling" with the IRS. After they prepared the taxes, they did nothing else. They would not return a phone call or email and still will not. I had a deadline with IRS so I had to negotiate a settlement and set up a payment plan myself. Tax Masters claims the person handling my account left the company. They also claim they couldn't negotiate a settlement because I was being audited, which I was not. But even if I was and they could not perform the service, why not give me my money back. They did nothing, be aware of doing business with them. They will suck you in and as soon as you pay you can never get hold of them. I'm out $1500 for zero service.
I contacted Tax Masters regarding issues I was having regarding an IRS Audit and alleged back taxes. I signed a contract with Tax Masters to help me. Tax Masters has been paid approximately $2700 for fees to investigate the claims by the IRS. Of the amount paid to Tax Masters, $1050 was paid for them to represent me at a CDP hearing with the IRS. All the requested data was sent to Tax Masters as requested. I have made several calls to their customer service department regarding status updates. My calls were never returned. I am now faced with a situation wherein IRS intend to implement a lien. IRS sent me 2 letters stating no data was sent to them regarding my case. I request the following -Refund of all the funds paid to Tax Masters. Their non-response is a breach of contract as far as I am concerned. -Legal documentation (to be provided to the IRS) which reflects that the non-response was a result of Tax Masters mishandling of my case and their sub-standard services. If there is any damage per liens, etc., Tax Masters should be responsible for damages, since I signed a legal document contracting their services. Thank you.
I hired Tax Masters (TM) to resolve a tax issue. After a phone conference on Jan. 2009 where in Deapholis S (TM) told me that TM was settling cases similar to mine for approximately 15% of the "owed" tax. I then sent TM $3,050. to cover the items as outlined in "the agreement". TM did very little work between Jan-Sep 2009. I was never contacted by my "case worker" (Toni G from Jan. 2009 to Sep. 2009. TM told me to ignore any IRS notifications sent to me and to contact TM with any IRS transmissions. TM did not respond to my requests about their contact with the IRS on my behalf. TM did not initiate the part of our agreement that was to cost me the remaining $2,050 left from my deposit to TM. I feel that amount is owed to me. Not to mention the additional penalty & interest that TM cost me by delaying and not dealing with my account. I have tried many times (phone calls, emails, including certified mail) to contact TM, but as of 10/20/09, I have not received a response. I am owed $2,050. from Tax Masters. There may be sufficient grounds on which to charge them for the additional penalties & interest I incured from the IRS because of Tax Masters lack of dealing with the matter in a timely fashion. I would be satisfied to receive my $2,050.
Contacted and paid $2200 for asistance with tax problems $700 in overdraft fees for inconsistant charges $2200 paid for promises. missed work due to stress complications
On February 2, 2008, my husband called Tax Masters for help with our current tax situation. We spoke with Ronald S. who assured us their company was legal and that could help us with our situation. I was very skeptical about this company and wanted get more information but they would send the contract until after we gave our deposit of $1,000.00 and make payments of $875.00 for the remaining balance (they originally wanted $4,500.00 up front but I did not agree to that as I did not know of the company). I told Mr. S. from the beginning I had set up an installment agreement with the IRS and I did not want to make a payment to Taxmasters and the IRS and Mr. S. assured me "everything would be all right". Taxmasters then sent me the contract and had both my husand and myself sign the contract. Everything look legal so we signed the contract. As days passed, we did not hear from anyone and both my husband and I called them on numerous occasions and could not get anyone, just answer machines asking to leave messages. On February 14,2008, I finally spoke to a person, Salena S., whom I told I wanted to cancel the contract and she specifically asked me to write a letter to that effect and send it, which I did. Again, we did not hear from anyone and we tried on numerous occasions to contace someone without any luck. In March, TaxMasters deducted $875.00 from my business account and I agained called TaxMasters, this time I spoke with Mr. Claude C. I explained the situation to him and he again asked me to send a letter of cancellation to his e-mail which I did on March 31, 2008. I then received a letter of cancellation from Mr. G. Collections Manager on April 2, 2008, stating per my request they cancelled their services and no further work will be done on our file, but since a retainer agreement has been signed by us, we are ineligible for a refund. I sent Mr. G. an e-mail asking what the retainer fee was, that it did not state in the contract what the retainer fee was. I also wrote I searched the BBB files and found out their company had numerous unsatisfactory reports. I told Mr. G. his company was a fraud, they did absolutely nothing for me and my husband except make notes and asked him to contact me. Mr. G. did call me on April 3, 2008 and I explained the above-mentioned information to him and he asked me to send the original letter I sent to Mr. S. to him and he would present it to the "Review Board", again which I did. On April 11, 2008, I received a letter from Mr. G. stating the Review Board has considered my refund application. The Review Board has recommended a partial refund on my file, however, that recommendation must be adopted by the Executive Officers. He also went on to write: At this time, I cannot provide a timeline as to when this process would be completed. With this information, I decided to call my bank and requested all checks for $875.00 submitted for Taxmasters be refused. I tried calling Mr. G. on April 17th, April 21st,and April 22nd in referrence to our refund and could not get anyone. I sent Mr. Garrett an e-mail and requested he give me a call which he never did. I called again on May 1st and left a message. I called on May 6th and spoke with Mr. Garrett who stated their still was no signature from the Officers about the refund. I also asked Mr. G. to send me a copy of what the company did for the monies received, which he never did. On May 9th, one month and eight days after teminating TaxMasters services they tried to deduct $875.00 from my account again. I tried calling Mr. G. again but no answer so I sent him an e-mail about this deduction and telling him I specifically requested from him a detailed summary of what services were rendered for $1,855.00, which again never happened. On May 12th I received a letter from Mr. G. stating "Until my refund request has been ratified by the Executive, our contract with us is still considered active. Accordingly, all drafts will be completed as agreed, pursuant to the installment agreement. While you have cancelled services, as I explained to you at the onset, you would still be liable to TaxMasters for the balance of the agreed retainer. If any drafts are made on your account prior to action by the Executive Officers, that amount will also be included in your refund". At this point, I stopped all contact with TaxMasters. Yesterday, May 29th, TaxMasters tried once again to take out the money but only this time they sent two checks both for $437.50. My bank caught it today and will be reversing the monies. I don't know where to go for help but I need to put a stop to this company. As of Monday, June 2nd I will be closing my account to prevent further deductions. Other than mental strain and the fact I have to keep vigilent about my corporate account, no ecomonic or physical damage as of yet.
